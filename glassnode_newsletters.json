    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nFalling Tides\n\nBitcoin is trading in the $93k-$97k range, leading to a wider digital asset market cooldown. Capital inflows are weakening, and derivatives activity is declining. Short-term holder accumulation patterns somewhat resemble May 2021, which was a relatively challenging set of market conditions.\n\nCryptoVizArt, UkuriaOC, Glassnode\nFeb 19, 2025 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nAfter Bitcoin’s second attempt to break above $105k in late January, the market has entered a contraction phase, with monthly price momentum sharply declining across major assets.\nBitcoin has held relatively steady, while Ethereum, Solana, and Memecoins have faced much deeper corrections, reflecting a shifting appetite for risk.\nSolana has emerged as a market leader in capital inflows over the past two years, in contrast to Ethereum, which has comparatively struggled to attract sustained demand.\nHowever, this week, all digital assets aside from Bitcoin have seen a dramatic decline in capital flows, with Solana, and its associated memecoin ecosystem taking a relatively large hit.\nPerpetual futures open interest has declined across Bitcoin (-11.1%), Ethereum (-23.8%), Solana (-6.2%), and Memecoins Index (-52.1%), reflecting a diminished appetite for leveraged speculation.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nMarket Momentum Takes a Breather\n\nThe Bitcoin market attempted to rally above the ATH, and back into price discovery in late January 2025. This rally, however, could not achieve the necessary momentum, and the market has entered into a period of contraction and consolidation since then, with price momentum sharply declining across major assets.\n\nBitcoin: +48.4% (Nov 2024) → -5.9% (Feb 2025)\nEthereum: +60.3% (Dec 2024) → -16.9% (Feb 2025)\nSolana: +53.2% (Nov 2024) → -33.1% (Feb 2025)\nMeme Coins Index: +90.2% (Dec 2024) → -37.4% (Feb 2025)\n\nNotably, Memecoins and Solana have thrived during strongly trending market conditions but also tend to correct sharply during downturns. Ethereum has remained one of the weakest performers throughout this cycle, and whilst it has outperformed Solana this week, a robust trend of out-performance has not yet been established.\n\nLive Chart\nAssessing Performance So Far\n\nThe recent slowdown comes after an extended period of strong gains across the major digital assets. Looking at the performance since early 2023, we can see clear differentiation in how each asset has navigated the cycle so far:\n\nBitcoin is trading within a range approximately 3.4x higher than April 2023, providing a benchmark return profile.\nEthereum has struggled compared to its peers, ranging between 1.3X and 2.0X relative to April 2023.\nSolana's returns since 2023 peaked at 11.8x in early January 2025, but have since dropped sharply to around 7.6x as the current correction took hold.\nMemecoins Index: Saw an explosive uptick in prices in mid-2024, largely aligned with Solana’s out-performance, and peaking 5.2X since 2023. However, recent weeks have seen this sector get hit quite severely, with total performance now being the worst out of the four assets.\n\nThis provides a view of Solana’s high-beta nature, where it has experienced both the strongest upside and also the sharpest corrections. Bitcoin’s steadier trajectory highlights its resilience as a benchmark return profile for the digital asset space. Memecoins, in particular, have seen a marked decline in investor demand of late, suggesting there has been a change in risk appetite.\n\nLive Chart\nCapital Flows Drive Markets\n\nThe strong out-performance of Solana over the last two years aligns with a persistent capital inflow from investor demand. Looking at the monthly change in the realized cap, we can see clear patterns in capital movement across various digital assets:\n\nSolana: Has consistently attracted higher relative capital inflows, supporting its strong price appreciation.\nEthereum: Has seen the weakest capital net inflow out of the majors, explaining its relative underperformance.\nMemecoins: Experienced several abrupt but unsustainable surges in capital inflow, reflecting speculative bursts, but without sustained momentum.\n\nHowever, in recent weeks, the momentum of capital inflows has declined for all digital assets. Notably, Ethereum and Top Memecoins have now flipped negative (capital outflows), with Ethereum facing a -0.1% net outflow from the Realized Cap and Memecoins Index seeing an even sharper -5.9% outflow.\n\nThis signals a meaningful cooling down in speculative appetite and alludes to a potential for capital rotation out of riskier assets on the road ahead.\n\nLive Chart\nWeakness In Futures Markets\n\nAs momentum starts to fade in spot markets, we can also see a decline in capital inflows within the perpetual futures market. The cooling of demand on the spot side has led to a sharp drop in perpetual open interest (OI) across all major assets, signalling a reduction in speculative activity and lower cash and carry yields.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the rate of change in open interest highlights a widespread retreat of capital:\n\nBitcoin OI: -11.1%\nEthereum OI: -23.8%\nSolana OI: -6.2%\nMemecoins OI: -52.1%\n\nThis trend of declining open interest across the board suggests that speculators are reducing their leveraged exposure, likely in response to weaker market momentum and increasing market uncertainty. The most extreme decline is seen in Memecoins, which tend to attract more short-term leveraged bets but lose traction quickly whenever sentiment weakens.\n\nLive Chart\nFunding Rates Signal Bearish Sentiment\n\nThe weakening in open interest is further reinforced by a decline in perpetual futures funding rates. This reflects a shift toward more bearish sentiment and an unwinding of leveraged positions, particularly in riskier assets.\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum funding rates remain slightly positive, and their deeper liquidity profile tends to see positive funding rates except during sharp leverage wash-out events.\nSolana funding rate have edged lower and have traded negative in recent weeks, signalling a cooling off of demand for long speculative positions.\nMemecoins have seen funding rates turn very negative, indicating that shorts now dominate in these highly speculative assets, and many traders are closing their positions (or being liquidated).\n\nNegative funding rates for Solana and Memecoins suggest a net shift towards bearish sentiment in higher-risk assets and a closing out of excessive long-sided leverage.\n\nLive Chart\nETF Flows and Market Impact\n\nWith the market in a contraction phase, institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum has slowed based on spot ETF flows. By normalizing net inflows against each asset’s native spot volume, we can gauge the weight and influence of the ETFs on market dynamics.\n\nBitcoin ETFs saw several outflows exceeding $200M/day last week, however this was followed by a strong rebound in buy-side activity, exceeding 8% of global spot volume, and highlighting institutional demand (akin to ‘buy the dip’ behavior).\nEthereum ETF demand has cooled significantly and remains much smaller in scale compared to Bitcoin. ETF activity for ETH is hovering close to zero in terms of net flows in and out, suggesting a lack of strong traditional investor demand and participation.\n\nThis divergence has been a theme of this market cycle thus far and reinforces Bitcoin’s dominant role within the institutional asset mix. Ethereum continues to struggle to attract large, sustained inflows, which further explains its relative underperformance in recent years.\n\nLive Chart\nA Key Bull-Bear Threshold\n\nBitcoin is currently trading $1k-$5k above the Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis, located at $92.5k. Historically, this level has served as a key pivot point between local scale bull and bear phases, being the pivot point where the average recent buyer moves between a state of unrealized profit and loss.\n\nReviewing previous instances where Bitcoin reached a new ATH and then corrected lower, we can see a similar pattern in May 2021, Nov 2021, April 2024, and Feb 2024.\n\nIn each of these cases, the downtrend extended toward the lower band of the STH cost basis model, specifically -1 standard deviation (σ) below the cost basis. Currently, this lower band sits at $71.6K, helping frame up the potential downside risks should these historical patterns repeat.\n\nLive Chart\nPost ATH Consolidation\n\nIn prior instances where Bitcoin has reached a new ATH, we observe a consistent post-rally pattern, where a surge in realized supply density occurs within ±15% of the spot price. This results from the market transitioning from an aggressive uptrend into price consolidation, as the market trades within a relatively narrow range.\n\nThis behaviour is evident in previous cycle tops, where:\n\nAs the market rallies within price discovery, the realized supply density crashes lower all the way up to the price peak.\nMarket participants then begin redistributing coins as the market enters a correction or consolidation phase.\nThis often occurs close to the STH cost basis, as the conviction and demand profile of new investors is tested.\n\nThe current realized supply density aligns with a typical post-ATH consolidation phase, where buyers and sellers try to establish a new equilibrium before the next major trend unfolds.\n\nLive Chart\nApproaching a Decisive Market Moment\n\nTo better understand how sensitive the market is due to this supply density, we can analyze the supply held by short-term holders (STH) in recent post-ATH distribution phases. This helps gauge the patterns of new investor accumulation and whether current conditions resemble past cycle peaks.\n\nWhen comparing STH supply changes, we observe:\n\nThe recent accumulation phase closely mirrors May 2021, suggesting a similarly large amount of supply, and investors will be sensitive to a price decline below $92.5k.\nIn April 2024, new investors also accumulated aggressively, but the magnitude of the STH supply uptrend in the current cycle structurally aligns more with May 2021 rather than 2024.\n\nGiven these similarities, we are now very close to a decisive moment in the market—a phase where price action is primed for uncoiling. If demand remains strong, Bitcoin could establish a new range above ATHs. However, a lack of sustained buy pressure could lead to a deeper distribution-driven correction, similar to prior post-ATH phases. This would likely be driven by panic amongst recent buyers who see their recently acquired coins move from being in profit to holding an unrealized loss.\n\nLive Chart\nConclusion & Summary\n\nBitcoin has been consolidating around $95k for several weeks and is trading within a relatively stable range. The same cannot be said for the wider digital asset landscape, with Ethereum, Solana, and Memecoins all seeing significant drawdowns from their cyclical highs. In particular, Memecoins have seen a significant cool-off of demand, as evidenced by capital outflows, sharp price declines, and bearish sentiment in futures markets.\n\nFor Bitcoin, the key level to watch is the Short-Term Holder cost basis around $92.5k. This is a pivot point where a large proportion of recent buyers will see their holdings move into an unrealized loss. This could precipitate more downside as panic sets in. In either case, the current consolidation phase appears to be nearing its later stages, and the market looks ready to trend in one direction once again.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nProfiling the Sell-Off\n\nThe digital asset market has encountered tumultuous waters in recent weeks, with investors experiencing sharp price falls, and locking in substantial losses. The Altcoin space was the worst hit, with a significant decline in valuations. In this report, we analyze the severity of the sell-off.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nFeb 11, 2025 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary:\nBitcoin investors have realized large losses during the downturn, with BTC prices falling as far as $93k.\nWhen we normalize these losses into a BTC denomination however, the severity of the damage does appear to be in line with other local corrections.\nThe majority of the locked in losses originate from the Short-Term Holder cohort, as local top buyers experience a rapid decline in their profitability.\nThe Altcoin sector took the heaviest relative losses during the downturn, with the global altcoin market cap experiencing one of its biggest devaluations on record.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nA Major Devaluation\n\nLast week, Bitcoin investors experienced an intense whipsaw in price action. BTC prices initially fell to a low of $93k, followed by a brief recovery to $102k, and are now trading closer to $98k. The indecisive price action is largely in response to President Trump’s threat of tariffs applied to Canada, Mexico and China, providing an uncertain macro backdrop for investors. Alongside this, persistent strength in the US dollar has contributed to a marginally stressed liquidity environment.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhilst the price of Bitcoin has fluctuated wildly over recent weeks, it has not moved very far from its starting position over this period, as the prevailing regime of choppy and generally sideways movement continues.\n\nIn the previous edition of The Week On-chain, we evaluated how the composition of Bitcoin investors has evolved this cycle. Bitcoin has seen a substantial uptick in liquidity entering the asset, and larger capital flows are balancing the inertia of an increasingly large asset. Additionally, the growing presence of a more resilient and patient holders has contributed to the stability of BTC prices, even amidst a relatively unstable macro backdrop.\n\nOn the other hand, the Altcoin sector has experienced significant sell-side pressure, with many assets struggling to achieve widespread adoption or product-market fit, making for a more challenged market environment. This has culminated in a wide-scale collapse of token prices, with all altcoin sub-sectors under-performing Bitcoin in recent weeks.\n\nLive Dashboard\n\nTo explore the downside price action across the altcoin space, we can utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which projects the correlation of token returns into a two-dimensional space. This visualization helps identify tokens that tend to behave similarly (clustered together) or differently (far apart) based on their return behaviors.\n\nWe can observe that the majority of ERC-20 tokens are densely clustered, highlighting that a wide swathe of altcoins experienced the same broad-based sell-off, with a distinct lack of idiosyncratic behavior between different sectors.\n\nIn other words, very few tokens managed to shrug off this weeks downside volatility, and they largely all moved lower together.\n\nLive Dashboard\n\nWe can evaluate the magnitude of the drawdown by assessing the 14d change in the global altcoin market cap. Over the last fortnight, the altcoin market cap declined by $234B, with a small handful of events days recording a larger absolute drawdown.\n\nThe severity of this drawdown underscores the scale of the capitulation event and can be reasonably considered to be an event within a bear market within the altcoin sector.\n\nThis is quite interesting as Bitcoin does not appear to display the same relative weakness, suggesting a divergence is opening up between BTC and the rest of the digital asset landscape.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we look at this metric in percentage terms, the altcoin drawdown is still significant, with only 41 / 1662 trading days recording a larger drawdown. However, in this relative scale, it does remain more in line with previous drawdown events experienced throughout 2024.\n\nThe present drawdown is also substantially less aggressive when compared to the sell-off in May 2021 (the Great Miner Migration) and in late 2022 when LUNA/UST and 3AC collapsed.\n\nLive Chart\nInspecting Bitcoin Losses\n\nDespite Bitcoin price being relatively flat over the week, the realized losses locked in by Bitcoin investors during the choppy swings in price action were one of the largest of the current bull market cycle. Investors locked in around $520M in losses as the market sold off to $93k, being one of the largest local capitulation events so far.\n\nTherefore, we can consider this as a meaningful capitulation event within the context of a macro scale bull market uptrend. Only the losses locked in on 5-August-2023, during the yen-carry trade unwind, stand out as a larger one-day loss (seeing -$1.3B in realized loss).\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs Bitcoin grows in size, we must also consider that absolute measures of realized loss may become misleading when we compare it to previous price ranges. When assessing these losses in a BTC denomination, which effectively normalizes for market size, the severity of the losses starts to look more ‘typical’.\n\nThis surge in losses is of a similar magnitude to previous local capitulation events throughout 2024, suggesting this may still be considered a normal event for a bull market correction/consolidation period.\n\nLive Chart\nProfiling The Losses\n\nDuring a bull market regime, long-term investors are generally highly profitable. Therefore, the dominant source of realized loss originates from the Short-Term Holder cohort, which accounts for the pool of recent investors who have the highest average cost basis.\n\nTypically, Long-Term holder losses are absent during the bull market. Loss-taking for the LTH cohort usually begins as the cycle transitions from a bull market into a bear market and accelerates as the market drawdown intensifies. This ends with a final flush out, often peaking near the macro cycle low.\n\nAlternatively, the comparatively price-sensitive Short-Term Holders tend to realize heavy losses during drawdowns within both bull and bear markets. Short-Term Holder entity-adjusted realized losses totalled $520M this week, which is a similar magnitude to pullbacks throughout the 2024-25 cycle thus far.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we increase the granularity of our profile for Short-Term Holder losses, we can see that the majority of losses were associated with investors who had only acquired their coins within the last 1-month. The age-based breakdown is as follows:\n\n24hr Realized Loss: $68.5M\n1d-1w Realized Loss: $286.3M\n1w-1m Realized Loss: $479.1M\n1m-3m Realized Loss: $14.5M\n3m-6m Realized Loss: $112.0\n\nThis reinforces the notion where the majority of onchain volume, and realized losses tend to be linked with investors who have most recently entered the market, and are thus the most sensitive to volatility and price fluctuations.\n\nLive Chart\nLooking Forward\n\nAs prices whipsaw around, we can employ a suite of onchain-derived pricing levels to explore some potential pathways and thresholds for price on the road ahead.\n\nTo assess areas of critical support, we can utilize the MVRV Z-Score on a 1yr rolling window. This specific transformation provides a clearer representation of near-term market dynamics, with the model capturing only recent market behaviour.\n\n🔴 +2σ: $118.0k\n🟡 Mean: $96.3k\n🔵 -1.5σ: $80.1k\n\nAt the moment, the price has found strong support near the Mean level. Should prices break lower, the -1σ may mark a key threshold for the bulls' next major line of defensive support. Conversely, the +1σ level may act as resistance, as investors come into a meaningful amount of unrealized paper profit and may seek to realize them into market strength.\n\nLive Chart\n\nSince we have identified that the majority of losses originate from the Short-Term Holder cohort, it becomes prudent to highlight their investment positioning as the market trades around this middle MVRV support range.\n\nThe average Short-Term Holder cost basis has also historically acted as a strong support level during a bull market uptrend. This pricing model currently trades at around $92.2k, and is a key region to hold for the market to avoid further downside.\n\nWe can similarly employ the ±1σ bands based on a full lookback Z-Score transformation, to assess the typical upper and lower bounds for price action.\n\nShort-Term Holder Cost-Basis +1σ: $131k\nShort-Term Holder Cost-Basis -1σ: $71k\n\nRight now, the spot price is trading in between the upper and lower bands, and is hovering above the STH cost basis. This suggests that the bulls are still in control, but price is nearing their first lines of defence, and almost tested the STH cost basis during the recent sell-off event.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe importance of defending the STH cost basis and the MVRV 1Yr Z-Score pricing regions becomes increasingly apparent when overlaying the price traces onto the URPD volume profile. A significant volume air-pocket can be seen below these levels, where very few coins changed hands in that price range.\n\nAdditionally, the -1σ band for the STH cost basis resides at the upper bound of this volume gap, suggesting this may be a relatively sensitive area should prices fall that far.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe Bitcoin price has been both wildly volatile and ultimately flat over the last few weeks. It has traded up to a high of $105k, down to a low of $93k, and yet ended the week where it started around $98k.\n\nThis unstable price action resulted in a substantial loss event totalling $520M, one of the largest of the cycle when priced in USD. However, when assessing the severity of the drawdown through a normalized measure, the sell-off remains broadly in line with other local corrections.\n\nIn contrast, the Altcoin sector has undergone a broad sell-off and failed to find firm footing. The majority of tokens have experienced a highly correlated downside sell-off, with few sectors spared from the damage.\n\nThis has led to one of the largest Altcoin devaluations on record and highlights a notable dislocation between Bitcoin and the typical rotation of capital prior market cycles have seen towards the altcoin landscape.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA New Mindset\n\nThe regulatory environment surrounding Bitcoin is constantly changing, and new financial instruments such as derivatives and ETF products continue to develop. In this article, we analyze how the composition of digital asset investors is changing around it.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nFeb 4, 2025 • 9 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBitcoin has evolved into a global asset with extremely deep liquidity that is available at all hours of the day. This creates the conditions for investors to speculate, trade, and express their macro-economic views at times when traditional markets are closed.\nBitcoin continues to prove itself as an emerging store of value asset, accruing over $850B in net capital inflows. It also serves a role as a medium of exchange asset, processing nearly $9B in economic volume per day.\nMultiple metrics for new demand remain elevated, however they are substantially lower than was experienced during the heights of previous cycles.\nThe composition of investors in digital assets is also changing, with a notable rise in more sophisticated institutional investors within the Bitcoin space. This has led to a general decline in the magnitude of drawdowns and a compression of volatility over time.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nProving Ground\n\nSince Bitcoin’s inception in 2009, it has grown into a global asset with extremely deep liquidity, and remains actively traded at all hours of the day. Given global events often occur outside of traditional market trading hours, this makes Bitcoin of of the few assets where investors can express a view over weekends for example.\n\nOver the weekend, Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline as market participants responded to the Trump administration's implementation of tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China. Given other markets were closed, Bitcoin and other digital assets saw a sharp decline and then a recovery:\n\nBTC traded from $104k down to $93k (-10.5%) before recovering to $102k.\nETH traded from $3.4k down to $2.5k (-26.5%) before recovering to $2.8k.\nSOL traded from $236 down to $184 (-22.0%) before recovering to $217.\nLive Chart\n\nBitcoin in particular now has increasingly role on the world stage, with nation-states such as the Kingdom of Bhutan running large-scale Mining operations, El Salvador promoting the currency to legal tender, and the United States Government considering the potential of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.\n\nBitcoin has now traded above the psychologically important $100k level for several weeks now, a feat many critics deemed impossible. This was achieved 7 years on from its last logarithmic milestone of $10k, achieved during the 2017 bull run.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhilst Bitcoin’s acceptance is growing amongst traditional investors, it still remains a contentious and polarising topic for many, often based on questionable claims regarding a lack of intrinsic value or utility.\n\nNevertheless, Bitcoin has cemented its position as one of the largest assets in the world, sporting a market capitalization of $2T, and ranking as the 7th largest asset worldwide. Notably, this positions Bitcoin above Silver ($1.8T), Saudi Aramco ($1.8T) and Meta ($1.7T), making it increasingly difficult to ignore.\n\nData Source\n\nAs the valuation and weight of an asset reaches these large scales, its inertia rises in tandem. The knock on effect is that Bitcoin now requires significantly larger inflows of fresh capital to achieve continued growth in its market cap. To explore this idea, we can utilize the Realized Cap metric which measures the cumulative netflow of capital into a digital asset.\n\nIf we benchmark from the cycle low set in Nov 2022, when the Realised Cap was $400B, Bitcoin has since absorbed an additional capital inflow of just approximately +$450B, more than doubling the Realized Cap.\n\nThis reflects the aggregate “value stored” in Bitcoin at around $850B, with each coin priced at the time it last transacted on-chain.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhilst BTC is often viewed primarily as an emerging store of value asset, the Bitcoin network is also able to operate as decentralized rails for BTC as a medium of exchange. The combination of nodes and miners allow for any individual or entity to settle payments across borders, without the interaction of a third-party intermediary.\n\nWhen utilizing Glassnode’s entity-adjustment heuristic to filter for only economical transactions, over the last 365 days, the Bitcoin network has processed an average of $8.7B per day, with total value transferred over the last year reaching $3.2T.\n\nBoth the Realized Cap, and the economic volumes settled by the Bitcoin network offer ewmpirical evidence that Bitcoin both has ‘value’ and ‘utility’, challenging the assumption by critics that it has neither.\n\nLive Chart\nRelative Dominance\n\nAfter establishing Bitcoin’s growing relevance as a macro asset, we can shift our focus internally, and analyze its dominance relative to the wider Digital Asset ecosystem.\n\nSince the collapse of FTX in Nov 2022, Bitcoin Dominance has been in a persistent uptrend, rising from 38% to 59%. This suggests that there has been a net rotation and value accrual towards Bitcoin preferentially over others in the digital asset landscape.\n\nThis may be in part explained by the wider access that the US spot ETFs offer for institutional capital. Bitcoin also has a somewhat clearer core narrative as a scarce asset, held by many as a monetary hedge against the debasement of fiat currencies globally.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhen we compare the Market Cap of Bitcoin and various altcoins (excluding Ethereum and Stablecoins), we can see a growing divergence in valuation is underway. Anchoring ourselves to the 2022 low once more, we can compare the growth in Market Caps.\n\nBitcoin Market Cap: $363B > $1.93T (5.3x)\nAltcoin Market Cap: $190B > $892B (4.7x)\nLive Chart\n\nWhilst there is a divergence in size of Bitcoin and altcoin valuations, the correlation between the two remains robust. This suggests that the driver for this divergence is not the rate of growth between the two, but instead a substantial difference in capital entering Bitcoin relative to the Altcoin sector.\n\nWhilst Bitcoin continues to garner the lions share of the capital from investors, it would be expected that Bitcoin dominance would continue to climb (with a reversal in that metric being a signal for capital rotation in the other direction).\n\nLive Chart\nWhere is New Demand?\n\nWith BTC prices breaking the $100k mark, one would expect the magnitude for Bitcoin exposure to be significantly heightened. We can evaluate this by assessing the percentage of network wealth which is held by coins acquired less than 3 months ago. The chart below plots how this metric has evolved over the 12 months after breaking to a new cyclical ATH.\n\nWhilst new demand this cycle is meaningful, the wealth held in 3month old coins is much lower than it was compared to previous cycles. This suggests that there has not been the same magnitude of new demand inflows, seeming to occur in bursts and peaks, rather than on a sustained basis.\n\nInterestingly, all previous cycles had concluded approximately one year after the first ATH break, which highlights the atypical nature of our current cycle, which first reached a new ATH in March 2024.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we isolate the transfer volume from small wallets (with less than $10k), we can see a notable decline when compared to the 2021 ATH. This comes despite the significant increase in overall volume settled this cycle, and significantly higher Bitcoin prices.\n\nThis suggests that new demand for BTC has been dominated by larger sized entities, rather than small retail sized entities.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also utilize alternative datasets such as the Google Analytics search interest over time to support our thesis. Search intensity has not reached the previous euphoria levels witnessed during the 2021 bull run, despite a multitude of tailwinds for the asset.\n\nBitcoin Interest Over Time\nAn Evolving Investor Base\n\nWhilst the Bitcoin protocol is largely fixed in its structure and consensus code, the market response to it is an ever-evolving and dynamic process. The regulatory environment is in constant flux, and new financial instruments such as derivatives and the ETF products continue to develop around it. As the environment around Bitcoin evolves, so too does the composition of Bitcoin investors, which is most notable during this cycle.\n\nWhen comparing the balance changes of smaller entities (Shrimp-Crab holding <10 BTC), we note a stark change in behavioral patterns in recent years.\n\nDuring the 2013 and 2017 bull runs, we can identify periods of significant coin accumulation from these cohorts, often synonymous with ‘euphoric top buying’. This pattern appears to have broken down this cycle, with smaller entities engaging in more intense accumulation during corrections and pullbacks, and then transitioning into distribution as the market rallies to new ATHs.\n\nThis suggests the presence of a more sophisticated and educated investor base, even amongst those typically considered retail investors.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe introduction of the US Spot ETF Bitcoin instruments has also allowed new access for institutional investors, providing regulated exposure to Bitcoin. This has enabled the flow of latent institutional capital, with the ETFs taking in over $40B in net inflows, and breaching $120B in combined AUM in the 12-months since launch.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we dive into the IBIT investor cap table (as noted by analyst TXMC), we can see clear signs of heightened demand from institutional investors. This provides further evidence that Bitcoin is attracting an increasingly sophisticated investor base.\n\nControlled Downside\n\nOne of the many advantages of onchain data is it helps us profile the behavior of investors during periods of stress, such as during pullbacks and drawdowns.\n\nWhen we assess the magnitude of realized loss locked in during bull markets, our current cycle remains the most reserved. The only standout event where significant losses were taken by Bitcoin holders is the yen-carry unwind on 5-August. Outside of this, loss magnitudes have remained comparatively small, portraying a more patient, resilient, and price insensitive investor base.\n\nThis deviates meaningfully from previous cycle structures, where the 2015-2018 cycle was characterized by multiple periods of local capitulation. The 2019-2022 period was even more volatile, experiencing several deep and severe capitulation events, such as PlusToken unwind in mid-2019, The COVID-19 sell off in March 2020, and the great miner migration in mid 2021.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe volatility profile of Bitcoin is also in a state of change, with realized volatility trading at historically low levels for a bull market. Realized volatility on a 3-month rolling window is typically below 50% this cycle, whereas it regularly exceeded 80% to 100% in the prior two bull runs.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis reduced volatility profile, alongside the relatively level-headed investor base, has manifested as a much more stable price structure. The 2023-25 cycle thus far has been largely a sequence of stair-stepping price action (upwards rallies followed by periods of consolidation).\n\nWe have also seen a more controlled drawdown profile, with the current cycle experiencing the shallowest average drawdown from the local high of all cycles to date.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nBitcoin continues to establish itself as a global macro asset. Its constant availability for trading allows investors to express their market opinions at any time of the day, whilst its deep liquidity enables investors to execute trades at significant sizes.\n\nAddressing the criticisms regarding Bitcoin's role as a store of value and medium of exchange, the network has attracted over $850 billion in net capital inflows, whilst processing nearly $9 billion in economic volume daily. This data largely dispels challenges about these claims.\n\nRecent regulatory changes in the digital asset ecosystem have spurred an evolution in the composition of investors, leading to a greater presence of sophisticated institutional investors in the Bitcoin market. This more patient, resilient, and less price-sensitive investor base has contributed to a reduction in the magnitude of drawdowns and a decrease in volatility over time.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

We explore this idea from the perspective of the drawdown profile, price performance, and Realized Cap change. We also address misconceptions about the exchanges and ETF balances.\n\nCryptoVizArt, UkuriaOC, Glassnode\nJan 29, 2025 • 8 min read\n\nThe current bull market shows several structural similarities to the 2015–2018 cycle. We explore this idea from the perspective of the drawdown profile, price performance, and changes in the Realized Cap. We also address misconceptions about exchange balances, helping to frame up how many coins are in the custody of these large entities.\n\nExecutive Summary\nCyclical Market Growth: The rate of Bitcoin price appreciation has declined cycle by cycle, reflecting a path into market maturity. The drawdown profile of this cycle thus far closely resembles that of the 2015–2017 cycle. Prior cycles also hint at a potential acceleration phase in the bull market, which tends to occur around this time (relative to the cycle low).\nRealized Cap Expansion: The Realized Cap has grown by 2.1x in this cycle so far, below the 5.7x peak of the last cycle and aligns with the 2015–2018 cycle at this stage. The euphoria phase has yet to fully impact Realized Cap, indicating potential room for further market expansion.\nExchange Balances vs. ETF Wallets: We assess that the recent drop in exchange balances to 2.7M BTC is primarily due to supply migrating into ETF wallets, many of which are managed by custodians like Coinbase. Combined exchange and ETF balances have remained stable at around 3M BTC, reflecting a shift in market structure rather than a supply shock.\nCapital Rotation Insights: Bull markets are characterized by long-term holders distributing coins to new investors. Recent capital rotation trends have seen the Bitcoin uptrend holding $100k, underscoring the key role that new buyers have in supporting price momentum.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nBitcoin's Cyclical Evolution\n\nTo begin our analysis, we set the stage by comparing the price performance and drawdown profile across Bitcoin’s last four market cycles. This helps to contextualize the prevailing bull run within historical trends.\n\nThe chart below showcases Bitcoin's price performance index relative to the cycle low, and the following chart looks at the drawdown profile during bull markets. Via an assessment of these two charts, a few key trends emerge:\n\nDeclining Cyclical Growth: The rate of price appreciation (gradients) has diminished with each cycle, reflecting the ongoing market maturity and the increasing capital required to grow a multi-billion to multi-trillion dollar asset valuation.\nDrawdown Size: Drawdowns in the current cycle typically range between the 10.1% and 23.6% Fibonacci levels and closely resemble the 2015–2017 cycle.\nBull Market Phases: Bull runs typically feature an initial slow-growth phase (early bull), which is eventually followed by a period of rapid price expansion (the euphoric bull).\n\nThe current position of the 2023-25 cycle relative to the low set in late 2022 aligns with a possible transition into the second euphoric phase. Both prior cycles have seen a marked acceleration in price performance around this time, driven by an influx of new attention and demand for the asset.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe current cycle mirrors trends seen in the 2015–2018 cycle, a primarily spot-driven market due to the lack of developed derivatives and stablecoin infrastructure. However, the overall performance of that cycle peaked at more than a 100x return from the low, which is arguably quite unlikely given the starting price of $15.6k this cycle.\n\nNevertheless, we can build on this analysis using the drawdown profile during uptrends. What stands out is how similar the pattern of pullbacks is since the low was set after FTX collapsed. Despite Bitcoin trading at a market cap which is orders of magnitude larger, the typical drawdown from the local high has rarely exceeded -25%.\n\nThis is a reflection of the impressive demand profile that has emerged for Bitcoin in recent years, in part due to the acceptance of it as a macro asset in finance and the role of spot ETFs as a source of new demand.\n\nLive Chart\nRealized Cap Growth as a Bull Market Driver\n\nTo delve deeper into the phases and drivers of bull markets, we can examine how the Realized Cap has changed since each cycle low. This tool helps visualize the rate of net capital inflow deployed into the market, offering insight into the demand forces fuelling Bitcoin's cyclical rallies.\n\nDuring the 2011–2015 cycle, the Realized Cap grew by an astounding ~122x, a product of Bitcoin’s early exponential adoption. However, as the market matured, growth ratios declined with each subsequent cycle, speaking to Bitcoin’s transition into a capital-intensive and structurally mature market.\n\nIn the current cycle, Realized Cap has grown 2.1x so far—well below the 5.7x peak of the previous cycle, but again showing similarities to the 2015–2018 cycle. We can also see the clear change in the gradient as each cycle enters the euphoria phase of the bull market, where the Realized Cap inflects sharply higher (in log space).\n\nBy this metric, the market has not yet fully entered this stage of exponential Realized Cap growth, which suggests there may be room for potential expansion should demand accelerate from here. This idea is likely balanced by the considerably larger size of Bitcoin today, requiring much more capital to follow a similar path.\n\nLive Chart\nRotation of Capital: Long-Term to Short-Term Holders\n\nThe underlying driver of the Realized Cap climbing higher is profit-taking by Long-Term investors. We introduce a framework to track the capital rotation from these long-term investors to new buyers, providing a clearer view of supply dynamics during bull markets.\n\nIn bull markets, long-term holders spend long-dormant coins to lock in profits while new buyers absorb that supply at higher prices. The sustainability of a bull market depends heavily on the aggressiveness of demand, which drives price appreciation and sustains momentum.\n\nThe chart below illustrates this capital rotation during prior market markets, with 1.2M coins changing hands since the LTH Supply ATH of 14.3M BTC in December 2023. During the recent rally above $100K, 1.1M BTC have transferred from long-term to short-term holders, representing an impressive inflow of demand to absorb this supply at prices above $90k.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe rate of supply distribution offers further insights into investor behaviour and can be thought of as the near-term sell-side pressure being exerted.\n\nThe chart shows the long-term to short-term holder supply ratio, revealing these distribution dynamics over time. A rising trend signals a dominance of accumulation and HODLing behaviour, as fewer old coins are spent and more migrate into Long-Term Holder status. Conversely, a decline in this metric indicates strong distribution by long-term holders at the present moment.\n\nThe monthly rate of change in this ratio highlights two primary waves of distribution that have occurred in the 2023-25 cycle, which are comparable in scale to those in early 2021 and late 2017.\n\nIn each case, the market rallied for over a month after the peak sell-side, suggesting a lessening sell-side allows breathing room for the demand to push prices higher. However, each eventually reached demand exhaustion, and the market started to transition back into a HODLing dominant phase during the subsequent bear market.\n\nThese metrics demonstrate the interplay between long-term holder activity and the role capital rotation has in sustaining bullish market momentum.\n\nLive Chart\nAddressing a Misconception on Exchange Balances\n\nThere is a widely held misconception regarding the decline in exchange balances during this cycle and the potential implications for market structure.\n\nBitcoin balances on centralized exchanges have fallen to 2.7M BTC, down from 3.1M BTC in July 2024. While many interpret this as a form of supply shock caused by a mass of coins being withdrawn by individual investors—potentially creating upward price pressure—we believe the majority of this decline stems from coins reshuffling into ETF wallets managed by custodians like Coinbase.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAfter the SEC approved Bitcoin Spot ETFs in January 2024, eight of eleven spot ETFs selected Coinbase as their custodian. As demand for ETF products picked up, a significant migration of coins from exchange wallets into Coinbase’s institutional custodian wallets occurred.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFor clarity, the labels applied by Glassnode to exchange balances consider both the exchange wallets and those of Coinbase custody within the ‘Coinbase entity’.\n\nIn order to fully account for all ETFs, we can take the assets under management of the remaining ETFs that do not use Coinbase custody (FBTC and HODL) and add them to the total balance on exchanges.\n\nAccounting for the net AUM growth of these ETFs since their inception, the combined balance of exchanges and ETF wallets has oscillated around 3M BTC, which is the same level as exchanges alone held in January 2024.\n\nAs a result, the apparent decline in exchange balances since November is more likely to represent a shift in market structure rather than an overall reduction in available supply due to individual withdrawals.\n\nLive Chart\nConclusion and Summary\n\nBitcoin’s rally reflects a maturing market with reduced overall cyclical growth, measured bull market drawdowns, and moderated Realized Cap expansion. Though lower than prior peaks, the current cycle's 2.1x Realized Cap growth aligns with the 2015–2018 cycle, leaving room for potential euphoria-driven expansion in the longer term.\n\nWe also clarified that the widely discussed drop in exchange balances does not signal a drastic depletion when accounting for the supply migration to ETF wallets. Therefore, the notion of an imminent supply shock due to declining exchange balances is inaccurate.\n\nInstead, capital rotation from long-term holders to new investors remains the primary driver of market cycles. Following two distribution waves, the current cycle’s wealth rotation size and rate mirror the late 2017 and early 2021 bull markets. This suggests a demand exhaustion phase may follow in the short term, potentially leading to a predominant HODLing sentiment in the market.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nSeeking Liquidity\n\nFollowing two months of consolidation, Bitcoin has broken upwards from its rangebound conditions and surged to a new ATH of $109k. In this article, we evaluate the conditions leading into this move to demonstrate signals of impending volatility.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nJan 21, 2025 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary:\nCapital flows into Bitcoin remain positive, although they have declined in magnitude since first reaching $100k. This highlights a period of declining sell-side pressure as the market approaches a near-term equilibrium.\nSell-side pressure from long-term investors has also declined, alongside volumes deposited to exchanges for sale.\nSeveral measures of volatility are tightening up, with the market trading within a historically narrow 60-day price range, often a sign that the market is almost ready to move again.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nCapital Flows Approaching Equilibrium\n\nAs the price hit the $100k level, net capital inflows into Bitcoin surged, signifying investors were locking in substantial profits. These capital inflows have since started to decline in magnitude as the market consolidates and acclimatises to the new price range.\n\nThis slowdown in profit-taking represents a net reduction in sell-side forces, thus requiring less fresh capital to maintain prices within the trading range.\n\nThe Realized Cap is currently trading at an ATH value of $832B, and is growing at a rate of $38.6B/month.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Net Realized Profit/Loss metric is the first derivative of the Realized Cap, allowing us to discretely observe the magnitude of net capital flows occurring on-chain, denominated in USD.\n\nAs the market digests the profit-taking distribution pressure, the balance of realized profit and loss volumes gradually trends back towards the neutral position. This suggests that a reset of supply and demand forces is taking place, and that the majority of coins transacting at the moment are not locking in a large value delta relative to the price the coins were first acquired.\n\nProfit taking volumes reached a peak of +$4.5B in December 2024, and have now declined to a value of +$316.7M (-93%).\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe absolute magnitude of Realized Profit and Realized Loss (Entity-Adjusted) are another set of tools which helps us gauge the direction and sentiment of capital flowing in and out of Bitcoin.\n\nWhen we sum realized profit and loss together, we can see this combined metric has experienced a sharp decline from its ATH of $4B, down to a value of $1.4B. Despite this -65% decline, the current value remains elevated from a historical standpoint, highlighting the scale of day-to-day demand absorbing this capital during bull market conditions.\n\nLive Chart\nSupply Side Slows\n\nWe have established that there is a noteworthy decline in overall sell-side pressure. We can confirm this view using metrics like Coinday Destruction, and exchange inflow volumes to further investigate these dynamics.\n\nThe first tool we can employ to better profile investor distribution pressure is the Binary CDD metric. This metric tracks the expenditure of ‘holding time’ across the market, tracking when holders of old supply are transacting increasingly large volumes.\n\nWe saw a sustained period of heavy coinday destruction in late 2024, and early January. Over recent weeks, this metric has started cooling off, as relatively light coinday destruction took over.\n\nThis suggests that a significant number of investors who had planned to take profits have likely done so within the current price range. Generally speaking, this indicates that the market may need to go ‘somewhere else’ in order to entice and unlock the next wave of supply.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Long-Term Holder (LTH) Binary Spending Indicator is another metric we can use to evaluate the duration of sustained sell-side pressure. This tool focuses specifically on long-term investors.\n\nAligned with the heavy profit-taking volumes from before, we can see a significant decline in the total LTH Supply as the market reached $100k in December. The rate of LTH Supply decline has since stalled out, suggesting a softening of this distribution pressure in recent weeks.\n\nCurrently, the total LTH supply is starting showing signs of growth back to the upside, suggesting that accumulation and HODLing behaviour is now larger than distribution pressure for this cohort.\n\nLive Chart\n\nCentralized exchanges remain the primary venue for speculation and trade, and process billions of dollars in flows on any given day. Exchange inflows have markedly declined from a peak of $6.1B to $2.8B (-54%), which underscores a considerable reduction in recent speculative activity.\n\nNotably, LTH inflow volumes to exchanges have declined from $526.9M in December, to a current value of just $92.3M, a -83% decline in deposit volumes.\n\nThis further supports the thesis that long-term investors may have completed a large tranche of their profit-taking within this price range.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn order to further profile the supply and demand balance, we can compare the rate of various cohorts balance change, normalized by to the volume of BTC mined. This provides a relative measure compared to new issuance which was theoretically absorbed by each cohort.\n\nFocusing on the Shrimp-Crab cohort (holding <10 BTC) as a proxy for retail and individual investors, we note that this cohort has absorbed around +25.6k BTC over the last month. This compares to monthly issuance of around +13.6k BTC minted by miners.\n\nAs a result, these retail and individual holders have effectively absorbed 1.9x the volume of new supply coming to market via primary production.\n\nLive Chart\nCoiling Volatility\n\nA strong degree of confluence can be noted between both on-chain models, and the historically narrow 60-day price range, allowing investors to preempt regimes of heightened volatility.\n\nBy measuring the percent range between the highest and lowest price ticks over the last 60 days, we can see the compression or market volatility over time. The chart below highlights periods which have a tighter 60 day price ranges than the current trading range. All of these instances have occurred prior to a significant burst of volatility, with the majority being in early bull markets, or prior to late stage capitulations in bear cycles.\n\nLive Chart\n\nSustained sideways price action within a narrow range allows for a large proportion of the circulating supply to redistribute and concentrate at a relatively higher cost basis.\n\nThe Realized Supply Density metric quantifies the supply concentration around the current spot price within a ±15% price move. When supply is highly concentrated around the spot price, small movements in price can significantly affect investor profitability, which in turn can amplify market volatility.\n\nAfter the Bitcoin price peaked in December, it started to consolidate, creating a dense concentration of supply with a cost basis close to the spot price. Currently, 20% of the supply resides within a ±15% of the spot price.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Sell-Side Risk Ratio describes this phenomenon from a different perspective. This metric assesses the total volume of both realized profit and loss locked in by investors relative to the asset size (measured via the Realized Cap). We can consider this metric under the following framework:\n\nHigh values indicate that investors spend coins at a significant profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium and usually follows a high volatility price move.\nLow values indicate that most coins are being spent relatively close to their break-even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‘profit and loss’ within the current price range and usually describes a low volatility environment.\n\nThere has been a significant contraction in Short-Term Holder spending activity in recent weeks, leading the Sell-side risk to decline very sharply. This often signals that all of the profit and loss taking events which investors planned for, have now been executed. It tends to signal that the market is near a local equilibrium, and is a precursor to the next wave of volatility.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nBitcoin has experienced intense intraday whipsaws in price, surging to a new ATH of $109k before crashing and subsequently stabilizing above $100k. This heightened degree of market indecision is compounded by the challenging and uncertain macro backdrop heading into, and across the US Presidential inauguration.\n\nIn this article, we evaluated and analyzed the conditions preceding the explosive yet wavering price action. We present a framework to identify signposts for impending volatility by utilizing the confluence of diminishing on-chain volume and capital flows, alongside a tightening price range.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Unrealized losses are primarily held by short-term holders; however, stress levels are relatively modest compared to previous drawdowns.\n\nCryptoVizArt, UkuriaOC, Glassnode\nJan 15, 2025 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBitcoin has entered a correction phase, trading -11% below its ATH of $108k but remaining above key support levels, retaining a constructive market structure.\nZ-Score analysis suggests cyclical highs typically align with various metrics trading 1.5 to 2.0σ above the mean, offering a framework to help navigate bullish market phases.\nBitcoin's current price is around 10% above the Short-Term Holders' cost basis of $88.4k, underscoring a potential risk of downside if momentum stalls and price trades below this level.\nUnrealized losses are concentrated among short-term holders, with 2.0–3.5M BTC held underwater, reflecting moderate stress in the market.\nRelative Unrealized Losses peaked at 4.3% during Q3 2024, significantly lower than prior cycles driven by external shocks, highlighting a more spot-driven and patient market.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nEvolving Peaks\n\nThe Realized Price reflects the average price at which all Bitcoins last moved on-chain, thus representing the market's aggregate cost basis. The MVRV Ratio is the ratio between the spot price, and the realized price, and it gauges the magnitude of unrealized profit held on average. Values above 1 signal an average unrealized profit, and trading below 1 indicate an unrealized loss.\n\nThe MVRV ratio is currently trading at 1.32, indicating the average unit of BTC is holding an unrealized profit of 32%. This structure is similar to post-ATH in mid-April 2024, suggesting an overall undertone of positive sentiment despite the market correction.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOver the years, Bitcoin's market has matured, which is accompanied by a cyclical decay in the peak values of MVRV near cyclical tops. This reflects an overall dampening of speculative extremes as the asset grows in size.\n\nEach market cycle has seen progressively lower MVRV highs, signalling lower average unrealized profit multiples being reached:\n\n2011: 8.07x\n2014: 6.00x\n2018: 4.81x\n2021: 3.98x\n2024: 2.78x (to date)\n\nThis decline describes a gradual reduction in volatility and speculative intensity as the market grows in scale and liquidity. It also suggests that, whilst Bitcoin remains cyclical, each peak becomes relatively less exaggerated, aligning with a more mature and efficient market structure.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo account for the diminishing peaks in MVRV over successive cycles, we can employ statistical methods to normalize its oscillating range. One such widely accepted approach in financial time series analysis is the Z-Score, calculated using the formula:\n\nZ-Score = (X - μ) / σ\n\nWhere:\n\nX is the observed value,\nμ is the mean,\nσ is the standard deviation.\n\nIn calculating the Z-Score, we can either use the entire historical dataset for a cumulative view or adopt a shorter rolling window to better capture the dynamic nature of financial cycles and diminishing peaks in MVRV.\n\nUsing the entire historical data for the MVRV Z-Score transformation can lead to some distorted results, as earlier cycles with much higher peaks skew the mean and standard deviation, making them less reflective of current market conditions.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTherefore, in an attempt to account for these effects, we have optimized the rolling window by reducing its length and thus using more recent market history as our benchmark.\n\nThe chart below compares the cumulative Z-Score with a version calculated using a 4-year rolling window. Despite this attempt to adapt to the dynamic nature of market cycles, the results remain nearly identical, and the issue of decaying peaks in MVRV persists unresolved.\n\nLive Chart\n\nMoving to a 2-year rolling window for the Z-Score calculation (blue), the peak observed in the most recent cycle ATH in March 2024 aligns closely with the peak ranges of the previous two cycles.\n\nIn this instance, we have now adjusted for the diminishing MVRV peaks. However, significant market highs in Q4 2015, Q3 2019, and Q2 2023 are not flagged by the 2-year rolling window Z-Score, suggesting there may be further optimization potential.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFinally, we have applied a 1-year rolling window to the Z-Score calculation, resulting in a more refined and promising transformation. This approach works to identify both the mid-cycle and late-cycle peaks on a similar scale, offering a clearer representation of near-term market dynamics.\n\nThis 1yr MVRV Z-score reveals that cyclical bulls consistently reach local and global peaks 2σ range, where investor profitability has increased significantly over a relatively short period of time. During bear market phases, local and global lows are captured when MVRV trades -1.5σ from the mean.\n\nThis improved MVRV Z-Score may provide a more responsive framework for identifying key market turning points throughout the cycle and helps adjust for the overall diminishing peaks near the extremes.\n\nLive Chart\n\nNow that we have optimized the rolling window to 1yr, we can extend this framework to back-calculate the threshold price levels which would define these near-term peaks and troughs.\n\nBull markets are characterized by prices trading between the 1-year mean, and peaking around 2σ above it. Conversely, bear markets see prices remain below the mean, with significant lows occurring near -1.5σ. This structured approach allows for a clearer delineation of market phases.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin is trading at $94,398, positioned above the 1-year mean of $90.9k but below the +2σ threshold at $112.6k. This suggests the market remains in a bullish phase, though it has retreated slightly from recent euphoric levels, which were above the upper band at the time.\n\nLive Chart\nAssessing The Correction\n\nWith the 1-year MVRV Z-Score model showing the market cooling off from a powerful rally, we can now assess the state of investor profitability by measuring the unrealized losses held. This helps to gauge market participant incentives and identify key areas of risk to keep an eye on.\n\nFirst, by analyzing the Entity-Adjusted Cost Basis Distribution of the circulating supply, it becomes clear that all unrealized losses are concentrated among short-term holders—investors who acquired their coins in the last 155-days, near the market peak.\n\nLive Dashboard\n\nFocusing on short-term holders as potential sellers under pressure, if the current market drawdown deepens, we can look for areas where unrealized losses may become severe.\n\nThe average Short-Term Holder cost basis is currently trading at $88.4k. Based on a similar statistical approach covered above, we have also displayed a high ($125.5k) and low ($68.5k) band, representing typical limits of price action during bull and bear markets.\n\nThe spot price is currently trading 9.2% above the Short-Term Holder cost basis, indicating that the market is still within the norms of a typical bull market. However, if the market fails to regain upward momentum, there is a heightened chance that falling below the STH cost basis could precipitate near-term stress, and potentially additional sell-side out should investors start to panic.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn order to better gauge the degree of stress experienced, we can assess the BTC supply, which is currently in a state of unrealized loss. From a historical perspective, over the last 10 years, we can observe that:\n\nDuring bull markets, the number of coins underwater has typically remained below 4 million.\nEarly bear market stages have been marked by 4–8 million coins held in loss.\n\nThis week, the volatility in the market pushed between 2.0 and 3.5 million coins into loss. While significant, this range is still lower than the 4 million coins in loss during the local market low set between July and September 2024. This suggests that the current market is likely in a less distressed state than it was during the previous corrective phase.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAnother dimension for measuring pain in the market is the Relative Unrealized Loss metric, which measures the ratio of unrealized losses (in USD) relative to the market capitalization. Reviewing recent cycles highlights parallels between the current market and the 2016–17 bull market.\n\nUnlike the 2019–22 cycle, where external shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic and the China mining ban pushed the Relative Unrealized Loss to levels exceeding 10%, the Q3 2024 consolidation phase only pushed this metric to ~4.3%.\n\nIt could be argued that the current market cycle has experienced less acute stress, likely due to shallower drawdowns, reduced volatility, and the new spot demand brought in via the ETFs, as well as institutional investors.\n\nLive Chart\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin has entered a correction phase and is trading 11.1% below its ATH of $108k. However, the spot price is still trading above several key support levels, suggesting the bullish market structure remains intact for now. This is compounded by the relatively light levels of distress in the market, as measured by historically small unrealized losses held by market participants.\n\nWe also showed how an optimized MVRV z-score using a 1-year rolling window provides a framework to navigate near-term bullish and bearish market phases. According to this model, we are also still within bullish territory, although the Short-Term Holder cost basis remains $88.4k is a key level to watch for maintaining constructive sentiment.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Long-Term Holders are capitalizing on this liquidity, taking the opportunity to distribute supply at scale, setting a new ATH in profit realized of $2.1B.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nDec 18, 2024 • 7 min read\n🎄\nFrom the Glassnode team: In the last edition of 2024, we want to thank all readers of The Week On-Chain and Glassnode members for your support this year. We hope you enjoyed reading The Week On-Chain, and using Glassnode tools, as much as we enjoy writing and building them. We wish you all the very best over the holiday season, and look forward to another exciting year in 2025.\nExecutive Summary:\nA striking degree of similarity in the Bitcoin price trajectory can be observed across prior cycles despite vastly differing market scales, investor composition, and market structure dynamics.\nWith price trading above $100k for a few weeks now, Long-Term Holders are taking the opportunity to distribute supply into fresh demand. This has resulted in a new ATH in realized profit being set, breaching $2.1B.\nA notable portion of these profit taking volumes are originating from coins aged 6m-12m, with coins older than this remaining relatively dormant in comparison.\nThe percentage of network wealth held by new investors has surged higher, highlighting a robust demand profile, but also reflects a transition in the balance of wealth away from longer-term HODLers.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nOld But New\n\n2024 has been another exceptional year for Bitcoin, with year to date returns of more than 150%, and the BTC price trading above $100k for a few weeks. When we compare price performance across cycles, we can see that the prevailing cycle is starkly similar to both the 2015-18, and 2018-21 cycles.\n\n2015-2018: +501%\n2018-2022: +1085%\n2022+ Cycle: +638%\n\nThis parallel becomes even more impressive when we account for the order of magnitude larger the Market Cap is between these cycles, requiring increasingly larger capital flows to support the same degree of growth.\n\nLive Chart\n\nInterestingly, the severity of market drawdowns during each bull market uptrend has declined as the market grows, despite the extreme sell-side pressure which typically accompanies aggressive upward price movements.\n\nThe deepest drawdown in this cycle has been -32%, set on 5 August 2024. The majority of drawdowns have only seen the price fall -25% below the local high, masking this is one of the least volatile cycles to date. This may be a reflection of the significant demand opened up by the spot ETFs, as well as a growing interest from institutional investors.\n\nLive Chart\nDissecting Losses\n\nIn the drawdown profile above, the declines in August 2023 and September 2024 are the two deepest drawdowns in the current up-cycle. Both of these periods can be characterized as a point of extreme market pressure, which carried significant potential to devolve into a regime of fear and accelerating losses.\n\nWe can visualize this using metrics associated with the Short-Term Holder (STH) cohort, which we often consider as a proxy for new market demand. As previously explored in our study on Seller Exhaustion, the STH cohort is the primary source of realized loss during uptrends, providing us with information regarding the top-heaviness of markets.\n\nTypically, periods of extreme market distress are characterized by a dominant portion of the coin supply falling into a position of loss (coins underwater). We can see in both of these instances (August-23 and September-24) that a super-majority of STH coins were indeed held at an unrealized loss.\n\nLive Chart\n\nHowever, when we measure the magnitude of unrealized losses (paper losses rather than the number of coins held in loss), we encounter a different picture. Whilst a super-majority of the STH supply (coin count) was underwater relative to their cost basis, they did not carry the extreme unrealized losses typically associated with deteriorating markets.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA similar story is apparent when we denominate Short-Term Holder losses as a percentage of their total invested wealth (divided by the STH Realized Cap). The previously mentioned periods did not lead to cascading realized losses despite the entirety of the STH supply being underwater on the position.\n\nIn the chart below, we highlight (blue) periods of time where both the percentage of Short-Term Supply held in Loss and the magnitude of losses locked have moved more than 1 standard deviation from the mean. The yen-carry-trade unwind on 5 August is the only notable point where this condition was briefly flagged throughout this bull market uptrend.\n\nLive Chart\nRamping Up Sell-Side Pressure\n\nIn the previous section, we assessed and evaluated the impressive relative strength of the Bitcoin market, even during corrections. Next, we will switch our focus towards the demand profile, which is acting to offset sell-side pressure from existing holders, who are taking profits.\n\nLong-Term Holders have distributed a significant volume of supply into the rally up to and through the $100k price point. Sell-side pressure from LTHs has eclipsed what was experienced in March when the market set the new ATH at the time of $73k.\n\nThe magnitude of this sell-side pressure is quite massive, but it is consistent with market dynamics typically experienced in the later phases of a Bitcoin bull cycle.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis has translated into a substantial volume of profits being taken by the LTH cohort, which has recently peaked at a new ATH of $2.1B/day.\n\nIf we adopt a simplified assumption that every seller is matched with a buyer, this observation provides some insight into the strength of the demand side, who, by contrast, has provided an estimated $2.1B of fresh capital into the market.\n\nLive Chart\n\nCompounding on the above observation, we can see the proportion of wealth held within recently moved supply has started to increase meaningfully in recent months. This occurs as coins held by Long-Term Holders are distributed to new investors, which in turn highlights a surge in new demand-side activity.\n\nNevertheless, the proportion of wealth held by these new investors has not yet reached the heights experienced during previous ATH cycle tops. The interpretation here is that the market may not have reached the level of euphoric fervour, and saturation by speculators seen in prior cycles.\n\nLive Chart\nComposition of Sell-Side\n\nAfter demonstrating the scale of the sell-side pressure originating from Long-Term Holders, we can increase the granularity of our assessment using age-band sub-sets of this cohort.\n\nBy assessing the spent volume of coins aged older than 6 months, it appears as though the majority of sell-side pressure originates from the 6m-12m subset. These coins were more or less acquired in 2024. Notably, coins aged 3 years or more have remained relatively static in comparison, potentially requiring higher prices before the holders decide to release their coins.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAdditionally, we can employ our age breakdowns of the realized profit metric to evaluate which sub-cohorts are contributing the most to sell-side pressure. Here, we calculate the cumulative profit-taking volume by age since the start of the Nov-2024.\n\n6m-1y Realized Profit: $27.3B\n1y-2y Realized Profit: $12.7B\n2y-3y Realized Profit: $8.1B\n3y-5y Realized Profit: $10.1B\n5y+ Realized Profit: $12.6B\n\nCoins aged between 6 and 12 months dominate the prevailing sell-side pressure, accounting for 38.5% of the total, providing confluence to the above observation.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can additionally bolster our thesis by assessing the URPD segregated by holding age. Here, we again note a significant amount of coins aged 2yrs-5yrs old remain changeless, underscoring the notion that higher prices are required to relinquish their coins.\n\nLooking Upwards\n\nTo close, we can now turn our attention to the AVIV Ratio which helps us assess the average unrealized profit (paper gains) held by investors that are active within the market.\n\nWe can utilize this metric to gauge whether the market is currently over/under heated relative to the profitability of its participants. Typically, Bull Markets reach their conclusion when all denominations of investors are in substantial profits, leading to enormous supply-side pressure coupled with an acute lack of new investors willing to buy at the current price.\n\nAt the moment, the AVIV Ratio has not yet reached its extreme band of +3σ, suggesting there may be room for the market to run before the profit held by the average investor becomes too tempting.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nSupply-side forces are becoming increasingly prominent as Long-Term Holders continue to actively distribute coins on a large scale, resulting in an impressive $2.1 billion in realized profit. However, a strong demand side is also evident, largely counteracting the significant selling pressure from existing holders.\n\nIn addition, the proportion of network wealth held by new investors has risen sharply, supporting the notion of a robust demand profile. Nevertheless, this indicates a shift in wealth distribution away from mature investors, which typically occurs during the later stages of Bull Markets.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Monumental Milestone\n\nBitcoin’s journey from the Genesis Block to $100k per BTC is a historic moment and a new high watermark in adoption. With 19.8M BTC mined, $131T in transfer volume processed, and 1.12B transactions, the $100k price milestone is yet another sign of Bitcoin's resilience.\n\nCryptoVizArt, UkuriaOC\nDec 11, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe Bitcoin price crossed the $100k mark for the first time on 5 December, after 5,256 trading days, and hitting a market cap briefly exceeding $2 Trillion.\nMiners have earned a cumulative $71.49 Billion since inception, reflecting the network's robust security and economic incentives.\nThe network has processed a total of 1.12 Billion transactions and settled $131.25 Trillion in transfer volume, with entity-adjusted figures providing an even clearer view of genuine economic activity.\nA breakdown of supply held by various cohorts highlights a broad distribution of Bitcoin ownership, ranging from retail investors to institutional-scale holders.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nThis week's newsletter examines Bitcoin's remarkable journey from its Genesis Block to surpassing the $100,000 mark per BTC. On December 5th, Bitcoin reached this monumental milestone for the first time, taking three days to achieve a daily candle close above $100k.\n\nThis report explores the evolution of the Bitcoin network and its economic foundations, tracing the incredible path from zero to this groundbreaking achievement.\n\nLive Chart\nMarket Expansion\n\nBitcoin has had an actively traded price for 5,256 days and has travelled from fractions of a cent to $100k. This journey has included 72 positive monthly candles (including December 2024), with an average gain of 37.4%, and 71 negative monthly candles, averaging a decline of -14.2%.\n\nThis reflects the fascinating balance between bull and bear markets and the infamous positive skew during the most consequential periods of price appreciation.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs of 5 December, a total of 19,791,952 BTC have been mined, representing 94.2% of the ultimate 21 million supply cap. The Bitcoin market capitalization also briefly traded above $2.0 trillion and has convincingly flipped the reported market cap of the precious metal Silver (~$1.84T).\n\nLive Chart\n\nThroughout this period of extraordinary market expansion, investors have realized a total of $1.27 Trillion in profit and -$592 Billion in losses on-chain (based on the delta between acquisition and disposal prices). This resulted in a cumulative net capital inflow (Realized Cap) of $750 Billion and underscores the tremendous value which has flowed into the Bitcoin network over its lifetime.\n\nLive Chart\nSupply Distribution\n\nOut of the total mined Bitcoin supply, the distribution amongst different wallet size cohorts is as follows:\n\n<0.001 BTC: 5,491 BTC (0.027%)\n0.001–0.01 BTC: 42,683 BTC (0.216%)\n0.01–0.1 BTC: 271,641 BTC (1.373%)\n0.1–1 BTC: 1,077,839 BTC (5.446%)\n1–10 BTC: 2,093,845 BTC (10.581%)\n10–100 BTC: 4,306,780 BTC (21.761%)\n100–1,000 BTC: 4,342,868 BTC (21.935%)\n1,000–10,000 BTC: 4,693,216 BTC (23.716%)\n10,000–100,000 BTC: 2,309,654 BTC (11.671%)\n>100,000 BTC: 647,934 BTC (3.274%)\n\nOf note is that a majority of these large-sized wallets (holding 1k+ BTC) are associated with exchanges, ETFs, and large institutional entities like MicroStrategy. Each of these large entities represents a collective ownership by thousands to millions of customers and shareholders.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOn December 05, notable aggregate balances included 1.8M BTC (9.1% of supply) held on exchanges and 1.1M BTC (5.6% of supply) managed by US-based ETFs, showcasing a significant growth rate since their launch on January 11, 2024. Additionally, miners (excluding Patoshi) retained a balance of 700k BTC (3.5% of supply), while the US Government Treasury held 187k BTC (0.9% of supply), reflecting the broad distribution of ownership across various entities.\n\nThese balances also underscore the increasing institutionalization and centralization of Bitcoin custody, balancing individual ownership with larger aggregated holdings that drive liquidity and market stability.\n\nLive Chart\nNetwork Evolution\n\nNext, we will focus on the evolution of the Bitcoin network, tracing Bitcoin’s journey as a system for transferring financial value since its inception. We will explore the milestones, technological advancements, and adoption trends that have transformed Bitcoin from an experiment into a global financial phenomenon, paving the way to its $100k price milestone.\n\nSince the Genesis Block, a total of 873,304 blocks have been mined, with an average block time of 11.8 minutes for Bitcoin to reach the historic price of $100k on December 5, 2024. Whilst the contemporary average block interval is faster at around 9.6 minutes due to hashrate increases, the early years saw a slow start, as Satoshi overestimated the power of a laptop CPU relative to the initial difficulty setting.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOver the same period, the network difficulty—measured in units that represent the computational effort required to mine a block—has increased dramatically. After 418 difficulty adjustments, excluding the periods without adjustment, network difficulty has increased to 446,331,432,498,125,300,000,000, as the security and computational power behind Bitcoin continue to grow.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus targets a condition where blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes, regardless of changes in network hashrate. It dynamically adjusts the mining difficulty every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks) to align with the target block time of 600 seconds.\n\nNetwork hashrate has surged from 128,185 hashes/sec to over 804,407,834,059,443,100,000 hashes/sec by the time Bitcoin reached $100k. Cumulatively, miners have computed approximately 5.01 x 1028 hashes to date. Remarkably, 37% of the total computed hash has occurred throughout 2024.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThrough 5 December, miners have earned a cumulative $71.49 Billion for their computational efforts, with block rewards valued on the day the block was mined. This revenue comprises $67.31 billion in block subsidy via the minting of new coins and $4.18 billion in transaction fees paid by users. This represents just 3.57% of Bitcoin's $2 Trillion market cap peak, arguably reflecting a tremendous return on the input security budget.\n\nLive Chart\n\nBitcoin has also experienced extraordinary transactional growth. To date, the network has successfully processed 1.12 Billion transactions (on an unfiltered basis).\n\nGlassnode’s entity adjustment heuristics consolidate activity across addresses deemed to be controlled by the same entity (e.g. ETFs or exchanges). This filters out internal transfers and provides a clearer picture of the actual economic activity occurring onchain.\n\nUsing our entity-adjusted variant of the total transaction count, we can filter out approximately 280M transactions as internal, leaving a total of 840M real economic transactions to date.\n\nLive Chart\n\nMeasuring the dollar value of these transactions at the time of confirmation, the Bitcoin network has cumulatively processed $131.25 Trillion in volume. After applying entity adjustment, the filtered transfer volume stands at $11.63 trillion, just 8.86% of the total.\n\nThis reflects how a majority of the transaction counts are economical in nature. However, a super-majority of the volume transferred on-chain can be associated with large exchange and custodian wallet management.\n\nLive Chart\nConclusion and Summary\n\nBitcoin's journey to $100k per BTC is symbolic not only of a price milestone but also as a testament to its remarkable journey from a small corner of the internet to a piece of globally important financial infrastructure. Since the Genesis Block, the network has matured by leaps and bounds, reaching a market cap of $2 Trillion, flipping silver in size, and settling $131 Trillion in volume via 1.12 Billion transactions.\n\nThe network has paid miners a cumulative $71.49 Billion in value, representing just a little over 3% of its market valuation in input costs to support itself, reflecting an incredible return on input costs. With hashrate near all-time highs and a highly distributed holder base, Bitcoin is well positioned for its increasingly important role on the world stage.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nNavigating Post-ATH Trends\n\nBitcoin's rally to the $99.4k ATH moved investor holdings to extreme profit levels, resulting in a sharp redistribution of supply. Several risk metrics are elevated and signalling caution, while realized profits and funding rates are starting to cool down, hinting at a period of consolidation.\n\nCryptoVizArt, UkuriaOC\nDec 4, 2024 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBitcoin reached a new ATH of $99.4k after a prolonged period of trading within the range of $54k to $74k.\nSeveral risk metrics we monitor have entered the Very High Risk 🟥 zone, reflecting a state of elevated unrealized profits and an increased susceptibility of investor sentiment to corrections.\nThe Realized Profit/Loss Ratio now shows intense profit-taking is underway, hinting at a potential period of near-term demand exhaustion.\nWith that said, realized profit volumes have declined by 76% from the ATH peak, and perpetual futures funding rates are also easing off, indicating the market is rapidly cooling off.\nEarly supply redistribution patterns suggest key demand clusters are between $87k and $98k, with very little supply having changed hands during the rally from $74k to $87k.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nUncoiling To A Higher Range\n\nAfter the market reached its first major peak in early March, Bitcoin traded between $54k to $74k for approximately eight months through to early November. Prolonged sideways price action within a narrow range allows a large proportion of the circulating supply to redistribute and concentrate at a relatively higher cost basis.\n\nThis concentration of supply can heighten the potential for investor panic when downside volatility returns. To track these dynamics, we introduce the Realized Supply Density metric, a tool that quantifies the supply concentration around the current spot price within a ±15% price move.\n\nA high supply concentration suggests price fluctuations can significantly impact investor profitability, which in turn can amplify market volatility.\n\nRevisiting the last five years of significant market moves reveals a common pattern:\n\nPeriods of indecisiveness often see over 20% of the supply concentrated within ±15% of the mid-range price.\nThis is usually followed by a sharp and volatile price move in either direction, which pushes this supply into a profit or loss.\n\nSuch volatility typically drives the Realized Supply Density metric below 10%, signalling that a large volume of coins now holds a meaningfully different unrealized profit or loss.\n\nThe recent breakout above $74k has triggered one of these cycles of redistribution, driving the Bitcoin price to a new ATH and pushing the realized supply density metric (±15%) to below 10%, in this case rewarding many investors with a healthy unrealized profit.\n\nLive Chart\nMapping Post-ATH Range Bands\n\nIn order to explore the dynamics of supply changing hands during price discovery, we can leverage a new concept called the Bitcoin Cost Basis Distribution (CBD). This metric tracks the concentration of supply at various price points via a heatmap. The Bitcoin CBD provides insights into how the supply is re-distributed over time across various price levels, helping to identify key zones of demand and investor interest.\n\nAs we enter the early stages of price discovery, the upper and lower range bands have not yet been fully formed. The most significant supply cluster is developing between $87k and $98k, with very little changing hands on the rally up to $87k.\n\nThis suggests that the current trading range is still finding equilibrium between buyers and sellers, but the risk remains that the ‘air-pocket’ below may offer little support if tested.\n\nLive Dashboard\nAssessing Elevated Market Risks\n\nIn this next section, we will consult a set of metrics designed to categorize different risk thresholds using on-chain data.\n\n1-Gauging Supply Profitability\n\nThe Percent of Supply in Profit (PSIP) metric helps us characterize market cycles, utilizing the proportion of supply holding an unrealized profit. This provides insights into the potential risk of selling pressure, as investors with unrealized profits tend to be incentivized to lock in their gains.\n\n💡 The PSIP metric is categorized into four risk levels:\n\n• 🟥 Very High Risk: PSIP > 90%, more than one standard deviation above its historical mean.\n\n• 🟧 High Risk: 75% < PSIP < 90%, slightly above its historical mean.\n\n• 🟨 Low Risk: 58% < PSIP < 75%, below its mean but above the lower band.\n\n• 🟩 Very Low Risk: PSIP < 58%, more than one standard deviation below its historical mean.\n\nPeriods where PSIP trades above the upper band typically align with the euphoric phase of bull markets. The recent price breakout has pushed the PSIP metric into this Euphoric Phase, which counter-intuitively marks a Very High Risk 🟥 zone. Historically, such levels are associated with heightened vulnerability to downside corrections, as investors are incentivized to realize profits, creating overhead supply.\n\nThis signals caution for market participants as the probability of increased selling pressure is rising accordingly.\n\nLive Chart\n2-Sizing Fear and Greed\n\nThe Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric quantifies the total profit or loss held by the market as a percentage of the market cap. This provides insights into the psychological state of the market, considering the magnitude of unrealized profit or loss.\n\nBuilding upon the Percent of Supply in Profit metric above, NUPL offers a deeper understanding of the magnitude of profitability, which drives the emotional sentiment of investors—ranging from optimism to euphoria and fear.\n\n💡 NUPL is categorized into four risk levels:\n\n• Very High Risk 🟥: NUPL exceeds 0.59, surpassing one standard deviation above the 4-year average. This phase, marked by extreme unrealized profit, reflects market euphoria and heightened correction risks.\n\n• High Risk 🟧: NUPL lies between 0.35 and 0.59, indicating the market is in profit but not yet at euphoric levels.\n\n• Low Risk 🟨: NUPL ranges between 0.12 and 0.35, suggesting moderate profitability, typically observed in stable or early recovery phases.\n\n• Very Low Risk 🟩: NUPL drops below 0.12, coinciding with market capitulation and Bottom Discovery phases in bear markets.\n\nAs the price broke above $88k, NUPL also entered the Very High Risk 🟥 zone, signalling the market is now holding an extreme magnitude of unrealized profit. This elevated level suggests there is a greater risk of investors starting to ramp up their sell-side pressure, capitalizing on higher prices and the strength of new demand.\n\nLive Chart\n3-Gauging Investor Spending Patterns\n\nGiven the elevated levels of unrealized profit in the system, we can now turn to the Realized Profit and Loss Ratio (RPLR) to gauge how investors adjusted their spending patterns as Bitcoin approached the $100k level.\n\nRPLR tracks the ratio of profit-taking to loss-taking events occurring on-chain. It, therefore, offers insights into the behavioural shifts of investors. Daily noise can be filtered by applying a 14-day moving average (14D-MA), providing a clearer view of macro trends.\n\n💡 The RPLR framework categorizes market risk into four tiers:\n\n• Very High Risk 🟥: RPLR exceeds 9, signaling over 90% of coins moving on-chain are being spent in profit—a common sign of demand exhaustion.\n\n• High Risk 🟧: RPLR ranges between 3 and 9, where 75%-90% of coins are spent in profit, often seen around market peaks.\n\n• Low Risk 🟨: RPLR drops below 3, indicating a transition phase with a balance of profit and loss spending (1 < RPLR < 3).\n\n• Very Low Risk 🟩: RPLR falls below 1, dominated by coins moving at a loss, typically observed during market capitulations.\n\nThe RPLR metric has similarly entered the Very High Risk zone 🟥, highlighting that the intensity of profit-taking activity throughout this price discovery rally is significant and likely to create overhead supply for the market to work through.\n\nLive Chart\nCooling Down\n\nWhile all three of these metrics are in the very high-risk zone, it is important to note that these conditions are typical of explosive rallies during price discovery.\n\nWe can now support this assessment by looking at the rate at which these metrics have cooled down over the last week. In particular, we will focus on realized profit and futures funding rates as key measures of sell-side pressure and excessive leveraged demand, respectively.\n\nRealized Profit, which tracks the USD gains from moved coins, peaked at $10.5B daily on the run-up towards $100k. It has since declined to around $2.5B per day, representing a 76% drop. This sharp reduction hints towards a marked cool down, suggesting the profit-taking may have been more impulsive than sustained.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe perpetual futures markets also provide a similar insight, with funding rates starting to plateau as speculative demand starts to stabilize.\n\nFunding Rates measure the interest cost of holding an open perpetual futures contracts, where, in this case, long traders must pay those on the short side. Funding costs spiked during the rally, but not to the same magnitude as in March this year.\n\nIf funding rates start to decline, that would signal that excessive long leverage is starting to ease out of the market, while a re-acceleration could signal additional risk is being added to the long side.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nBitcoin’s recent rally to a new all-time high of $99.4k marked a pivotal moment in this cycle, moving the market well into price discovery. The breakout from the long-standing $54k to $74k price range has pushed a significant volume of supply into an unrealized profit and also triggered several high indicators we use to track near-term risks of overheating.\n\nAt the same time, several indicators are starting to cool off, such as a rapid decline in realized profit volumes and a moderation in perpetual futures funding rates. This suggests there is a net slowdown in excessive speculative interest, as well as a net reduction in spot sell-side activity. The Bitcoin market is attempting to re-find equilibrium, with the $88k level at the base of the current supply density cluster.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nTouching Distance\n\nFollowing a flurry of consistent new ATHs, Bitcoin is just a stone's throw away from reaching a price of $100k per coin. Explosive price action tends to result in a significant increase in the unrealized profit of holders, and Long-Term Holders are ramping up their distribution in response.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nNov 26, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary:\nAs the Bitcoin price rallied towards $100k, Long-Term Holders commenced distributing over 507k BTC, which remains less than the 934k BTC sell-side during the March rally but is significant nonetheless.\nLong-term holders are locking in sizeable profit volumes, setting a new ATH of $2.02B in daily realized profit.\nWhen assessing the composition of which entities are spending, the majority of this sell-side pressure appears to originate from coins aged between 6 months and 1 year.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nIntense Long-Term Holder Distribution\n\nFollowing a flurry of consistent new ATHs, the Bitcoin price is now within striking distance of the impressive and long-awaited value of $100k per coin. Like all previous cycles, the Long-Term Holder cohort is taking advantage of inflowing liquidity and a strengthened demand side to recommence distribution of held supply at scale.\n\nSince the peak in LTH supply set in September, this cohort has now distributed a non-trivial 507k BTC. This is a sizeable volume; however, it is smaller in scale relative to the 934k BTC spent during the rally into the March 2024 ATH.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe see a similar story by assessing the percentage of aggregate Long-Term Holder supply transacted from a profitable position. Currently, an average of 0.27% of the LTH supply is being distributed daily, with only 177 out of all trading days recording a heavier distribution rate.\n\nInterestingly, we can observe that this relative rate of LTH spending is larger than the March 2024 ATH, underscoring a more aggressive distribution campaign.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also consult the LTH Liveliness metric to evaluate the balance between Coinday creation (holding time) and Coinday Destruction (spent holding time). Typically, Liveliness uptrends are characterized by an environment of heightened spending activity, whereas downtrends denote that HODLing is the primary dynamic.\n\nWhile the current rate of supply distribution is greater than the March peak, the volume of Coinday destruction remains lower. This highlights that most LTH coins transacting are likely to have been acquired relatively recently (e.g., more likely to be 6 months old than 5 years old on average).\n\nLive Chart\nProfits Locked In\n\nLong-Term Holders have a key role in the price discovery process, as they are a dominant source of previously dormant supply returning into liquid circulation. It becomes more prudent to assess the degree of profit-taking amongst this cohort as the bull market progresses, as they tend to become increasingly more active as prices rise.\n\nLong-Term Holders are currently realizing a massive $2.02B in realized profit per day, setting a new ATH and eclipsing the previous one set in March. A robust demand side is required to fully absorb this supply overhang, which may require a period of re-accumulation to fully digest.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAssessing the balance between profit and loss volumes taken by LTHs, we can see that the ratio of the two has accelerated rapidly in November. By definition, this results from the lack of LTH supply held in loss during this price discovery regime.\n\nHistorically speaking, the price has remained within a euphoric state for several months, assuming there is a substantial and consistent inflow of fresh demand.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Sell-Side Risk Ratio assesses the total volume of both realized profit and loss locked in by investors relative to the asset size (measured via the Realized Cap). We can consider this metric under the following framework:\n\nHigh values indicate that investors spend coins at a significant profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium and usually follows a high volatility price move.\nLow values indicate that most coins are being spent relatively close to their break-even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‘profit and loss’ within the current price range and usually describes a low volatility environment.\n\nThe Sell-Side Risk ratio is approaching the high-value band, inferring that significant profit-taking is occurring within the current range. Nevertheless, the current reading remains substantially lower than the terminal value reached in prior cycles. This suggests that previous bull markets have seen sufficient demand to absorb supply, even under similar relative distribution pressures.\n\nLive Chart\nThe Composition of Spending\n\nHaving established a significant uptick in Long-Term Holder profit-taking, we can increase the granularity of this assessment by scrutinizing the composition of the supply sold.\n\nWe can utilize our age breakdowns of the realized profit metric to evaluate which sub-cohorts are contributing the most to sell-side pressure. Here, we calculate the cumulative profit-taking volume by age since the start of the Nov-2024.\n\n6m-1y Realized Profit: $12.6B\n1y-2y Realized Profit: $7.2B\n2y-3y Realized Profit: $4.8B\n3y-5y Realized Profit: $6.3B\n5y+ Realized Profit: $4.8B\n\nCoins aged between 6 months and 1 year dominate the prevailing sell-side pressure, accounting for 35.3% of the total.\n\nThe dominance of coins aged 6m-1y highlights that the majority of spending has originated from coins acquired relatively recently, highlighting that more tenured investors are remaining measured and potentially waiting patiently for higher prices. One could argue that these selling volumes may describe swing trade style investors, who accumulated after the ETFs launch and planned to ride only the next market wave higher.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFollowing this, we can apply the same methodology to the magnitude of profit realized across all investors, segregated by percentage ROI locked in.\n\n0%-20% Realized Profit: $10.1B\n20%-40% Realized Profit: $10.7B\n40%-60% Realized Profit: $7.3B\n60%-100% Realized Profit: $7.2B\n100%-300% Realized Profit: $13.1B\n300%+ Realized Profit: $10.7B\n\nInterestingly, these groups have a degree of uniformity, with all cohorts realizing a similar proportion of the total. It could be argued that this represents a ‘chips-off-the-table’ strategy, where investors with a lower cost basis achieve similar USD profit volumes by selling fewer coins over time.\n\nLive Chart\n\nLooking specifically at coins acquired during 2021, 2022, and 2023, we can observe both considerable and sustained spending behaviour in the March peak.\n\nHowever, for the prevailing rally, spending predominantly consisted of coins acquired in 2023, with coins from 2021 and 2022 only starting to increase their sell-side pressure. This again aligns with a possible interpretation of ‘swing-trade’ style profit-taking as a dominant strategy.\n\nLive Chart\nGauging Sustainability\n\nTo gauge the sustainability of this uptrend, we can compare the structure of the current URPD to that experienced during the March 2024 ATH.\n\nIn March 2024, after several months of appreciation following the ETF launch, supply changed hands at several supply clusters between $40k and $73k ATH. Over the seven months of choppy price action that followed, this region became one of history's most significant supply clusters.\n\nAs supply was re-accumulated, it formed the eventual support from which this rally began.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFast forwarding to today, the market rallied so quickly that very few coins changed hands between $76k and $88k. Two key observations can be ascertained from this:\n\nPrice discovery is a process that tends to require rallies, corrections, and consolidations to confirm new price ranges.\nThere is a sort of ‘air gap’ below $88k, which may become a zone of interest if the market corrects lower before re-attempting a move above $100k.\n\nAs the market attempts to re-find equilibrium in this price discovery regime, changes in the supply distribution can provide insight into supply and demand zones of interest.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nSupported by surging price action, Long-Term Holders are meaningfully distributing coins, locking in a substantial $2.02B in profit. This has created an overhang of supply that must be absorbed to accommodate sustained increases in price.\n\nWhen evaluating the composition of which entities are spending, the majority of this sell-side pressure appears to originate from coins aged between 6 months and 1 year. This underscores the potential for further distribution from older entities who require a higher price to part with their coins.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nRiding the Liquidity Tide\n\nBitcoin continues to relentlessly establish new ATHs, supported by robust capital inflows from both ETFs and the Spot Market, with over $62.9B entering the market over the last 30 days. As the market proceeds to heat up, Long-Term Holder spending begins to rise in tandem.\n\nCryptoVizArt, UkuriaOC, Glassnode\nNov 20, 2024 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBitcoin’s rally to $93k has been fuelled by robust capital inflows from both ETFs, and spot markets. Over $62.9B has entered the market over the last 30 days, with BTC dominating the demand inflows.\nElevated unrealized profits among long-term holders have triggered significant spending activity, with 128k BTC sold between 8-October and 13-November.\nU.S. Spot ETFs played a pivotal role, absorbing around 90% of the selling pressure from long-term holders over the analyzed period. This highlights the growing importance of the ETFs in maintaining liquidity, and stabilizing the market.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nCapital Inflows Surge\n\nSince the start of November, the Bitcoin price performance has been nothing short of remarkable, repeatedly forming new ATHs throughout the month. When comparing the price performance of the current cycle to the 2015-2018 🔵 and 2018-2022 🟢 cycles, a striking persistent similarity can be seen. Both the magnitude of the rally, and the duration are surprisingly consistent, despite vastly differing market conditions.\n\nThis longstanding consistency over cycles remains intriguing, offering insights into Bitcoin’s macro price behaviour and cyclical market structure.\n\nHistorically, bull markets in the past have extended for between 4 and 11 months from the current point, providing a historical framework for assessing cycle duration and momentum.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA new ATH has been set this week at $93.2k, putting Bitcoin’s quarterly performance at an impressive +61.3%. This is an order of magnitude higher than the comparative performance of both Gold and Silver, which have seen more modest quarterly rises of +5.3% and +8.0%, respectively.\n\nThis stark contrast suggests a potential rotation of capital from traditional commodity store of value assets, towards Bitcoin being a younger, emergent and digital one.\n\nThe Bitcoin market capitalization has also expanded to a staggering $1.796T, making it the 7th largest asset globally. This move positions Bitcoin above two symbolically significant global assets: silver, valued at $1.763 trillion, and Saudi Aramco, at $1.791 trillion.\n\nAs of current, Bitcoin trails Amazon by only 20%, placing this as the next important milestone in its journey up the ranks of the world’s most valuable assets.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFollowing Bitcoin’s standout 90-day performance, the broader digital asset market is starting to experience a meaningful influx of capital. Over the past 30 days, aggregate inflows have reached a massive $62.9 billion, with Bitcoin and Ethereum networks absorbing $53.3 billion, while stablecoin supplies have expanded by $9.6 billion.\n\nThese inflows mark the highest levels since the March 2024 peak, and reflects renewed confidence and fresh demand after the U.S. presidential election.\n\nLive Chart\n\nExpanding on the capital inflows observed, the vast majority of the $9.7 billion in stablecoins minted over the past 30 days were deployed directly to centralized exchanges. This inflow closely matches the total capital flows for stablecoin assets during the same period, emphasizing their pivotal role in stimulating market activity.\n\nThe surge in stablecoin balances on exchanges reflects strong speculative demand as investors position to capitalize on trends, further reinforcing the bullish narrative and post-election momentum.\n\nLive Chart\nInvestigating the Profitability of Investors\n\nWe have thus far explored the tides of rising market liquidity, which has supported outperformance for Bitcoin. In this next section, we will evaluate how this price action has affected the unrealized profitability (paper gains) of market investors, utilizing the MVRV Ratio.\n\nWhen comparing the current value of the MVRV Ratio 🟠 against its yearly moving average 🔵, we can see an acceleration in investor profitability. This phenomena has typically been a supportive environment for continued market momentum, but also creates conditions where investors become more likely to start taking profits to realize these paper gains.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs the profitability of market investors increases, the elevated potential for new sell-side pressure comes into play. By overlaying the MVRV Ratio with ±1 standard deviation bands, we can construct a framework to assess over and under-heated market conditions.\n\nOverheated (warm colors): MVRV trades above +1SD\nUnderheated (cool colors): MVRV trades below -1SD\n\nBitcoin's price has recently broken above the +1σ band, located at $89.5k. This signals that investors are now holding statistically significant unrealized profits, and suggests an increased likelihood of profit-taking activities.\n\nNevertheless, the market has historically remained in this overheated state for extended periods of time, especially when supported by sufficiently large capital inflows to absorb sell-side pressure.\n\nLive Chart\nLong-Term Holders Spending at Extremes\n\nDuring the euphoric phase of the market cycle, the behaviour of long-term investors becomes critical to monitor. LTHs control a substantial proportion of the supply, and their spending dynamics can greatly impact the market stability, eventually working to form both local, and global tops.\n\nWe can evaluate the paper gains held by LTHs by utilizing the NUPL metric, which currently resides at 0.72, just below the Belief 🟢 to Euphoria 🔵 threshold at 0.75. Despite the substantial price increase, sentiment among these investors remains measured compared to previous cycle tops, suggesting there may be further room for growth.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs Bitcoin broke above $75.6k, 100% of the 14M BTC held by long-term holders moved into profit, enticing an acceleration in spending. This has led to a non-trivial balance decline of +200k BTC since the ATH break-out.\n\nThis is a classic and repeating pattern, where long-term holders begin taking profits whenever price action is strong, and demand is sufficient to absorb it. With a significant amount of Bitcoin still under LTH ownership, it is likely that many LTHs are waiting for higher prices before releasing more coins back into liquid circulation.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can employ the Long-Term Holder Spending Binary Indicator to evaluate the intensity of LTH sell-side pressure. This tool assesses the percent of days out of the last two weeks where the cohorts spending exceeds their accumulation, resulting in a net decline in their holdings.\n\nSince early September, as Bitcoin's price gained momentum, long-term holder spending can be seen to steadily increase. With the recent surge to $93k, this indicator reached a value indicating 11 of the last 15 days have seen a LTH balance decline.\n\nThis highlights an increase in long-term holder distribution pressure, although it is not yet at the magnitude observed around the March 2021, and March 2024 peaks.\n\nLive Chart\n\nHaving identified the elevated spending behaviour by long-term holders, we can consult the next tool for deeper insights into their activity around pivotal market points. The interplay of profit taking, and unrealized profit can help to highlight their role in shaping cycle transitions.\n\nThis chart visualizes:\n\nLTH Realized Price (🔵): The average acquisition price for long-term holders.\nProfit/Loss Pricing Bands (🔵): Bands representing extreme profit (+150%, +350%) and loss (-25%) levels, which often trigger notable spending activity.\nProfit-Taking (🟩): Phases where long-term holders hold over +350% profits and ramp up spending.\nCapitulation (🟥): Periods of high spending by long-term holders in a -25%+ loss state.\n\nBitcoin’s price has surged past the +350% profit-band (located at $87k), prompting significant profit-taking behaviour amongst this cohort. Distribution pressure is likely to increase as the market rallies, and these unrealized gains expand accordingly. That said, this has historically signalled the start of the most extreme phase of prior bull markets, with unrealized profits growing to over 800% in the 2021 cycle.\n\nLive Chart\nInstitutional Buyers\n\nWe will now turn our attention to the role that institutional buyers have on the market, particularly via the U.S. Spot ETFs. The ETFs have been a major source of demand in recent weeks, absorbing a majority of the sell-side by LTHs. This dynamic also highlights the growing influence of institutional demand in shaping modern Bitcoin market structure.\n\nAs outlined in Week on-Chain 46, since mid-October, weekly ETF inflows have surged to between $1B to $2B per week. This represents a significant uptick in institutional demand, and are some of the most significant periods of inflows to date.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo visualize the counter balancing forces of LTH sell pressure, and ETF demand, we can analyze the 30-day change in the Bitcoin balance of each cohort.\n\nThe chart below shows that during the period from 8-October to 13-November, the ETFs absorbed around 128k BTC, which is approximately 93% of the 137k BTC in net selling pressure exerted by LTHs. This highlights the critical role that the ETFs have in stabilizing the market during periods of elevated selling activity.\n\nHowever, since 13-November, LTH sell-side pressure has begun to outpace ETF net inflows, echoing a pattern observed in late February 2024, where the imbalance between supply and demand led to increased market volatility, and consolidation.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nBitcoin's rally to $93k has been supported by strong capital inflows, with around $62.9B worth of capital flowing into the digital asset space over the last 30-days. This demand has been led by institutional investors via the U.S. Spot ETFs, perhaps even as capital rotates out of gold and silver.\n\nThe ETFs have played a key role, absorbing over 90% of sell-side pressure by Long-Term Holders. However, as unrealized profits reach more extreme levels, we can expect more LTH spending, which in the immediate term has outpaced ETF inflows.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nTrumping to a New ATH\n\nBitcoin’s rally to a new ATH is driven by strong spot demand and institutional inflows, with over 95% of supply in profit. This article explores on-chain indicators, highlighting robust spot buying momentum, rising ETF AUM, futures premiums, and the potential for sustained gains in this ATH phase.\n\nCryptoVizArt, UkuriaOC, Glassnode\nNov 12, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThis article explores Bitcoin’s recent rally to a new all-time high, examining the factors driving this upward momentum, particularly the strong demand in spot markets over perpetual futures.\nWe analyze the impact of the recent U.S. election on institutional inflows, highlighting how U.S. spot ETFs and CME futures open interest have surged as cash-and-carry strategies gain popularity.\nThe ATH discovery phase is assessed, focusing on the percentage of supply in profit and the market dynamics that accompany prolonged periods above 95% profitability.\nWe delve into on-chain cost basis bands to track demand momentum, illustrating how proximity to these bands can signal periods of strong market demand.\nFinally, we examine realized profit levels, noting significant profit-taking activity yet indicating that current levels remain below those seen in previous ATH peaks, suggesting room for continued growth.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nA Post-Election Surge\n\nAfter the U.S. presidential election results came in, with consensus pointing toward a more crypto-friendly stance under the Trump administration, a positive signal reverberated through the cryptocurrency market, propelling Bitcoin to a new all-time high. This break to ATH was echoed across all major BTC: Forex pairs.\n\nThis chart illustrates the drawdowns from ATH for Bitcoin (BTC) paired with various fiat currencies and gold (XAU). Notably, the BTC: TRY (Turkish Lira) pair was the first to hit its ATH on 26 June 2024, leading the charge before other pairs followed suit. On 06 November 2024, nearly all BTC: Forex pairs reached new ATHs, except BTC: Gold, which remains approximately 19.9% below its ATH despite Bitcoin’s current valuation at $88.6k USD.\n\nThe BTC:Gold pair remains approximately -19.9% below its ATH despite Bitcoin’s current USD valuation at $88.6k USD.\n\nLive Chart\n\nHistorically, U.S. presidential elections have significantly impacted Bitcoin’s market performance, with notable shifts observed in both price and realized cap—representing the cumulative wealth invested in the Bitcoin network.\n\n2016 Election (Republican administration):\n\nRealized capital surged by 20.3% leading up to the election and climbed 55.5% afterward.\nPrice rallied by 34.7% pre-election and soared by 124.6% in the post-election months.\n\n2020 Election (Democrat administration):\n\nRealized capital inflows grew by 16.5% before and by 196.3% after the election.\nPrice advanced by 35.4% pre-election and skyrocketed by 306.8% afterward.\n\n2024 Election (Republican administration, thus far):\n\nRealized capital increased by 13.3% leading up to the election but edged up slightly by 2% after.\nPrice appreciated by 10.1% before the election and gained 27.9% in the post-election period (to date).\n\nThe current cycle, therefore, reflects a more modest response in the run-up to prior elections, although still with a very optimistic tilt. The market is currently adjusting to the likely shifts in crypto-policy, which can be expected in the coming years.\n\nLive Chart\n\nContinuing the momentum from the recent ATH breakout, Bitcoin recorded its largest-ever weekly candle, with a staggering $11.6k gain. This rally vastly exceeded historical weekly moves, nearly five times the upper statistical band (1 standard deviation), signaling unprecedented bullish strength.\n\nThis exceptional price action reflects market optimism, with participants viewing the anticipated regulatory landscape as a catalyst for sustained capital inflows.\n\nLive Chart\nSpot-Driven Breakout\n\nThe chart highlights the daily Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) on Coinbase’s spot market, showing a significant uptick in buyer-side pressure. Recently, the daily spot CVD reached $143M, approaching the previous peak of $152M recorded on March 13.\n\nSince July, every Bitcoin rally has been accompanied by a strong surge in buy-side interest on Coinbase, signalling robust spot market demand in one of the largest US exchanges. This persistent appetite from investors suggests that market participants are increasingly constructive on digital assets and reinforces the spot-driven nature of the prevailing rally.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFollowing the solid buyer-side pressure observed on Coinbase’s spot market, the recent rally saw substantial inflows into U.S. spot ETFs, with assets under management rising by $8.8 billion in the last 30 days. This growth outpaced the $6.9 billion increase in CME futures open interest, indicating a pronounced preference for spot-driven exposure via ETFs.\n\nThe correlation between ETF inflows and CME open interest highlights the dominance of cash-and-carry strategies. Yet, the more robust ETF demand underscores a shift toward direct spot exposure during this market upswing.\n\nLive Chart\n\nUsually, sustained demand in the spot market momentum is followed by a similar positive momentum in perpetual futures. The recent premium peak in perpetual markets—reaching $1.59M/Hour per hour (with a 7-day average of $392k/Hour) on November 12th—reflects solid speculative demand.\n\nHowever, this level remains below the mid-March highs, reinforcing the hypothesis that the current rally has been more spot-driven. The tempered yet significant appetite in perpetual markets underscores that spot demand, rather than leveraged speculation, is the dominant force behind this price surge so far.\n\nLive Chart\nDiscovery of Euphoria Phase\n\nBitcoin has entered a new price discovery phase, putting all of the circulating supply into profit. This chart shows the percentage of supply held in profit, alongside the count of consecutive days each month where this metric is more than 95%.\n\nHistorically, these euphoric phases have persisted for around 22 days before a correction occurs, pushing more than 5% of the supply below the original acquisition price. The current rally has maintained this high-profit level for 12 consecutive days, underscoring strong market sentiment but also hinting at the possibility of a correction ahead based on past patterns.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis chart examines cumulative realized profit during the New ATH Discovery phase, highlighting the scale of profit-taking activity. Historically, monthly profit realization ranged between $30 billion and $50 billion before demand exhaustion set in, often signalling a cooling-off period.\n\nCurrently, we’ve observed $20.4 billion in realized profits since entering this latest ATH discovery phase. While profit-taking is substantial, it remains below historical peaks, suggesting additional room for further gains before reaching potential demand exhaustion.\n\nLive Chart\nDiscovery Phase Bands\n\nAs we enter a new ATH discovery phase, identifying the most effective price model to navigate this heightened market activity becomes essential. This chart displays the cost basis of new investors, along with upper and lower statistical bands (±1 standard deviation).\n\nDuring ATH discovery phases, Bitcoin’s price often approaches and tests the upper band multiple times, driven by solid demand momentum as new investors enter at higher price points. Currently, Bitcoin’s price stands at $87.9k, just shy of the upper band at $94.9k. Monitoring the proximity to these bands, especially the upper and middle bands, can highlight periods of intense market demand, reflecting the eagerness of new capital to enter the market during rally phases.\n\nCurrently, with Bitcoin’s spot price at $87.9k, it is shy of the upper band at $94.9k. Monitoring the proximity to these bands, especially the upper and middle bands, can highlight when periods of intense demand are slowing down, and where price is high enough for many existing holders to ramp up their sell-side pressure.\n\nLive Chart\n\nRealized profit volumes are currently averaging around $1.56B/day, with long-term holders contributing $720M, accounting for 46% of the total.\n\nDespite this uptick in profit-taking activity, the aggregated realized profit volume is around half of what was recorded during the previous cyclical ATHs (which breached $3B/day, with more than 50% attributed to long-term holders). This again suggests that there may be further room for upside if demand continues to flow in and that more sell-side pressure is required before typical peak levels of profit realization are reached.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nThis newsletter examined Bitcoin’s recent all-time high, primarily driven by solid spot market demand, mainly through U.S. spot ETFs. Institutional interest has surged post-election, with notable inflows into CME futures and ETFs, favouring spot exposure and fueling Bitcoin’s entry into a new ATH discovery phase. Over 95% of the circulating supply is now in profit, typically followed by significant profit-taking.\n\nAlmost all of the circulating BTC supply is now held in profit, although this is balanced by a significant uptick in profit-taking activity. While realized profits by both short- and long-term holders have increased, they remain below previous ATH peaks, which may indicate many investors are willing to wait for higher prices.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

The Realized Cap is currently trading at an ATH value of $656B, supported by a net 30-day capital inflow of $2.5B.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe explosive wave of profit taking into the March ATH culminated with a peak realized profit volume of +$3.1B.\n\nAs the market digested this move over the last seven months, realized profit and loss volumes both subsided towards an equilibrium position. This suggests a complete reset of supply and demand forces has occurred.\n\nAlongside this, we can see a structural increase in profit taking, which is starting to re-emerge, suggesting a new wave of demand is entering the market.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also see the shifting market dynamics using the ratio between profit and loss volumes.\n\nThe market currently resides in a profit-dominant regime, with the volume of profit realized being a staggering ~47x larger than losses. This reflects the increasingly thin volume of supply held at a loss as the market pushes up to and through to a new ATH.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also observe a non-trivial increase in profit-taking volume, which is up by +$635M/day.\n\nWhile this is a considerable USD value compared to the euphoria experienced near the extremes of previous bull cycles, this remains relatively modest.\n\nLive Chart\nETFs Experience Outflows\n\nOver the month, US Bitcoin ETFs have experienced remarkable demand, recording a surge of inflows which have rivalled the success observed across the product's initial launch.\n\nHowever, investors appear to have de-risked in the run-up to the US Presidential Election, highlighted by the notable outflows across the last 3 days. Nevertheless, with the formation of a new ATH, ETFs may see new demand and momentum chasers.\n\nLive Chart\nHeightened Volatility Expectations\n\nThe US Presidential Election has been a dominant focal point for investors, with expectations for heightened volatility being priced in for several weeks. Since 2023, options markets have grown to become a significant component of the Bitcoin market structure, enabling investors to express increasingly sophisticated views on the market.\n\nThe amount of open interest deployed across options contracts has surged to a value of $25.2B, with only the March ATH recording a higher value of $30.2B.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOptions trade volume is also ticking higher, now reaching a value of $2.9B, also bested only by the volume trading into the March ATH, and during the 5-Aug yen-carry unwind. This again highlights the growing presence of institutional-grade investors, utilizing sophisticated instruments to express their market opinion.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAssessing the ratio between open interest allocated to put and call contracts, there is an even split between both sides. This suggests that investors and speculators have hedged and bet on large market moves in both market directions.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis idea that investors expect rising volatility ahead is also visible in options implied volatility (IV) priced into options.\n\nCurrently, we are seeing a surge in IV across all contract expiration dates, most notably across the short-dated 1-week expiration. This confluences that the investors are forecasting and betting on a higher volatility regime both into and after the US election results are known.\n\nLive Chart\n\nBy comparing the difference between the options implied volatility and realized volatility over the same time period, we can calculate the volatility risk premium (VRP). This metric represents the compensation options writers require to take on volatility risk.\n\nPresently, the 1-month VRP resides at a value of 27.9%, with only 1.4% of trading days recording a larger value. This highlights how extreme the volatility profile is that is priced into options markets.\n\nLive Chart\n\nEvaluating the distribution of both puts and calls, which have an expiration on 6-Nov, just after US election day, we can see a near-even split between each side. Put options have a total open interest of 1348 BTC, whilst call options have an open interest of 1271 BTC.\n\nThis suggests that investors have hedged for both downside protection and upside exposure, highlighting the degree of uncertainty on the ultimate market direction.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nIn the aftermath of the US presidential election, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, trading above $75,000 for the first time this week. This move is supported by modest capital inflows of $2.5B/month, indicating the potential for further growth amidst a consistent influx of new demand.\n\nWith an increasing demand side, alongside expanding volatility expectations across option instruments, the market appears poised for further fluctuations.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Stones Throw\n\nThe Bitcoin spot price has continued to march higher, trading up to $69k, only 6.8% below the ATH. The price uptick has broken through several critical levels using technical and on-chain inputs. This is one of the first signs of positive price momentum since late June.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nOct 23, 2024 • 6 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe Bitcoin spot price has briefly rallied above $69k after successfully clearing several significant technical and on-chain pricing levels.\nFrom an On-chain perspective, all sub-age-groups within the Short-Term Holder cohort now hold an unrealized profit, likely a tailwind for market sentiment.\nHowever, speculation in futures markets is increasing, with open interest surging to new ATHs and a non-trivial portion attributed to the cash and carry basis trade.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nAccelerating Price Action\n\nThe Bitcoin spot price has caught a bid this week, rallying back to $69k, edging ever closer to the $73k ATH set in March. The market is trading just -6.8% below this peak price, relieving many investors after seven months of sideways and choppy conditions.\n\nWhen we measure the depth of drawdowns relative to the ATH over time, we can see that the severity of this drawdown is more in line with the 2021 up-cycle and less so with the 2019 and 2022 bear markets.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can further profile the market's resilience by comparing the spot price and key technical pricing levels. This rally has seen the market break through the combined resistance of the 200DMA 🟢 and the 111DMA 🟣, both of which Bitcoin investors tend to respond.\n\nInterestingly, the 365D SMA 🔵 has historically acted as either support or stubborn resistance at macro market inflection points. Recently, the 365DMA acted as strong support during the yen-carry unwind on 5 August and, to date, has defined the lower bound of the prevailing macro uptrend.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFrom the lens of Fibonacci retracement levels, the spot price has been primarily bounded between the ATH and the -23.6% region, acting as a general lower bound throughout the range bound price action.\n\nBitcoin trading within these bounds for several months is extremely atypical, underscoring how unique this sideways and choppy period has been. Typically, the Bitcoin market rallies to new ATHs or sells off more severely, which intrigues this consolidation period.\n\nLive Chart\nKey On-Chain Pricing Levels\n\nNet capital inflows into the Bitcoin asset have also accelerated, increasing by $21.8B (+3.3%) over the last 30 days. This has resulted in the Realized Cap ticking up to a new ATH, reaching over $646B.\n\nThis suggests that liquidity across the asset class is rising, and meaningful capital inflows support the price increase.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe AVIV Ratio is a fundamental metric within the on-chain analysts' toolkit, which assesses the magnitude of paper gains/losses held by active investors (by discounting inactive entities such as lost and long-dormant supply).\n\nThe AVIV Ratio has traded above its all-time mean YTD and bounced strongly off this mean when the yen-carry-trade unwound on 5 August. Generally speaking, this is a constructive signpost in that it suggests investor profitability remains relatively robust, and active investors have defended their cost basis over recent months.\n\nIn addition, we note that the AVIV Ratio has not breached its +1SD level since the March ATH, highlighting the potential room for growth should positive price momentum be established.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can use key on-chain pricing levels to construct a framework for thinking about Bitcoin market cycles. This can be considered under the following framework:\n\n🔴 Deep Bear Market: Prices trade below the Realized Price.\n🔵 Early Bull Market: Prices trade between Realized Price and True Market Mean.\n🟠 Enthusiastic Bull Market: Prices trade between the ATH and True Market Mean.\n🟢 Euphoric Bull Market: Prices trade above the previous cycles ATH.\n\nThe price is attempting to transition from the Enthusiastic Bull Market regime into the Euphoric Bull Market, distinguished by a sustained break above the 2021 ATH of $69k. This level was briefly breached during the March 2024 peak, however profit taking was too heavy at the time, necessitating a period to cool off investor excitement.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also assess the state unrealized profit for the Short-Term Holder cohort, which can be considered a proxy for recent buyers' sentiment in the market.\n\nPresently, the spot price is trading above the average acquisition price of all Short-Term Holder cohort sub-age groups. This means almost all recent buyers hold an unrealized profit, spotlighting the relief this rally has provided investors.\n\nLive Chart\nCash and Carry Intensifies\n\nThe derivative market for Bitcoin has experienced immense growth since the first perpetual swap instruments were launched in 2016. Derivatives markets have added significant depth and liquidity to the asset class, allowing for increasingly sophisticated trading and hedging strategies.\n\nOpen Interest across both perpetual and fixed-term futures contracts has recorded a new ATH of $32.9B this week, suggesting a marked increase in aggregate leverage entering the system.\n\nLive Chart\n\nDespite the preference for perpetual swap instruments across crypto-natives, the traditional fixed-term futures contract at the CME Group has significantly driven this uptick in open interest.\n\nThis product has provided the new wave of institutional investors with an instrument for regulated derivative exposure and an opportunity to capture yield via a cash-and-carry strategy. Open Interest across CME contracts has surged to a new ATH of $11.3B, highlighting increased institutional activity within the digital asset space.\n\nLive Chart\n\nHowever, the volumes traded across all futures contracts ($35B per day) remain somewhat subdued, especially compared to the elevated volumes when the market peaked at the ATH in March. This suggests that there has not yet been a significant impulse in trading activity and perhaps alludes to a higher dominance of single trade basis strategies and arbitrage positions within futures markets.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe yield available via Cash-and-Carry strategies is around 9.6%, almost double the ‘risk-free’ rate available from short-term US Treasuries. With additional Fed rate cuts expected in the months ahead, this basis trade will likely continue attracting institutional traders, further expanding market liquidity for Bitcoin.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFurther evidence of an increased cash-and-carry trade can be found by comparing the 30D sum of ETF netflows and the 30D change in CME open interest.\n\n🟠 30-day sum of ETF net flows\n\n🔵 30-day change in CME open interest\n\nWe can see a similar magnitude between these two metrics, which suggests a relationship between long-spot positions via Bitcoin ETFs and a short position via CME futures contracts to capture the yield.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nPositive market momentum continues to develop with the Bitcoin market, with the spot price breaking above several key technical and on-chain price levels. This has brought many investor positions back into a state of unrealized profit, likely to be a tailwind for sentiment.\n\nOpen interest in futures markets has also expanded recently, reaching a new ATH. The dominance of the CME Group exchange highlights an increasing presence of institutional investors in the digital asset space, with strong indications that a cash-and-carry strategy is in play.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Eye of the Storm\n\nA notable divergence between supply and demand is emerging, with the market being range-bound for over seven months. With low volumes across on-chain and futures markets and a HODLer-dominated environment, the scene is set for heightened volatility in the near future.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nOct 15, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe demand side of the market has declined notably since the March ATH, with investor attention thinning as the market chops sideways within this price range.\nOn the supply side, available coins are also constricting, with several measures of ‘active supply’ compressing to relatively low levels.\nHistorically, tightness in the Bitcoin supply side has been a precursor for a regime of heightened volatility.\nIt often describes an equilibrium being reached between the wealth held by new demand and existing HODLers, which tends not to last for very long.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nA Waning Demand Side\n\nThe rate of new capital inflows has continued to wane since the $73k ATH, set in March 2024. Due to the peer-to-peer nature of the Bitcoin network, buyers and sellers are matched on a 1-1 basis. Thus, measuring the Realized Profit or Realized Loss metrics can act as proxies for the magnitude of new capital entering or exiting the network.\n\nUsing this framework, we can see that the Bitcoin market currently sees around $0.73B in new capital flowing into the network daily, which is not insignificant but notably lower than the $2.97B peak set in March.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAn interesting significant spike in Realized Profit can be seen on 8-Oct within the raw, unfiltered variant of this metric. However, the same spike does not show up when looking at the Entity-Adjusted variant pioneered by Glassnode.\n\nThis profit spike was caused by a large internal transfer by the WBTC cluster, as the on-chain ownership structure is migrated by BitGo.\n\nGlassnode’s proprietary clustering heuristics successfully identified this non-economical transaction and correctly discounted it from the cleaned dataset. This provides a tangible view into the advantages of entity-adjusted filtering of on-chain transaction data.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOur Point-in-Time variant of the WBTC Balance shows a strictly append-only metric where their balance history is immutable, capturing the status of our clusters while recording the data point.\n\nFrom this perspective, we can observe the initial decline in the WBTC balance when it happened and its subsequent return to its previous level, as Glassnode’s automated clustering algorithm correctly reclassified the transfer as internal.\n\nLive Chart\n\nReturning to our demand-side assessment, we can use the Binary CDD metric as another proxy for demand-side pressure. This metric tracks the expenditure of ‘holding time’ in the market, tracking when holders of old supply transact large volumes (balanced by new buyers entering).\n\nWe can now see a relatively light volume of coinday destruction, suggesting that long-term investors remain relatively inactive within the current price range.\n\nOur gauges for demand-side intensity suggest investor attention and new demand inflows within this range are relatively muted and have not seen a significant second wave of YTD.\n\nLive Chart\nSupply Tightens\n\nAfter establishing the presence of a somewhat lacklustre demand side of the equation, it is prudent to assess its opposing force, the supply side. Here, we consider ‘supply’ as the volume of coins market participants are willing to spend and transact with.\n\nThe chart below profiles several measures of ‘available supply,’ including Short-Term Holder and Highly Liquid supply. We compare these against measures of ‘saved or stored supply’ such as Long-Term Holder or Vaulted supply.\n\nWe can see a multi-month rise in our ‘stored supply’ measures, highlighting a preference for HODLing amongst existing holders. This has led to a subsequent decline in ‘active supply’ measures, suggesting fewer coins readily transacting within the current price range.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also increase the granularity of our ‘available supply’ measures. We can assess the 'Warm Supply' cohort, which evaluates the supply using ‘coin-age’ heuristics and focuses explicitly on coins moved within the last month.\n\nIn our Long-Term vs Short-Term holder classification study, we quantified that the probability of spending is strongly related to the amount of time the coin has been held. Thus, the ‘Warm Supply’ captures an effective subset of coins we can reasonably expect to change hands soon.\n\nWe can also consider the Futures Open Interest and volume as a form of ‘supply exposure’ in derivative markets that we expect to be actively traded.\n\nCombined, this active supply measure has effectively halved since the March ATH. This suggests that low trade volumes on-chain and a reduction in Futures market activity highlight a net decline in investor speculation and attention.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Liveliness metric is an elegant tool which assesses the all-time balance between coinday destruction (spending) and coinday creation (HODLing). We note the substantial increase in spending activity between July and August, which includes the redistribution of Mt Gox coins back to creditors.\n\nThe liveliness metric is currently within a sustained downtrend, highlighting a solid preference by market participants to HODL their supply, which further constricts our available supply measures.\n\nLive Chart\nPersistent Intra-Cycle Investors\n\nWe have now established both a declining demand and a tightening supply side. We can bolster this assessment by inspecting the proportion of network wealth held by these two cohorts. We consider the behaviour of these cohorts under the following framework.\n\nShort-Term Indicator [<1 month] 🔴 The realized capital or wealth transacted within the last 30 days. This cohort corresponds closely to demand, including new investors deploying fresh capital into the market.\nLong-Term Indicator [1-2 years]🔵 This portion of the supply peaks during the bear market bottom formation phase. This cohort represents the long-term and price-insensitive investors accumulated during and held throughout the bear market.\n\nDirectly comparing the wealth of buy-side pressure against HODLer conviction, we note an elevated but declining presence of new demand. New demand is considerably higher than during the 2022 bear market but far below the heights reached in March.\n\nWe have not yet seen a sharp and sustained surge in new demand, typically accompanied by cycle peaks. Similarly, we have not started to experience a rise in HODLing pressure, which has historically been witnessed throughout deep bear markets.\n\nThis places the current market in a relatively unique period of equilibrium, which is almost a halfway point between two cycle extremes.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can further inspect this balance of wealth by using the Realized HODL Ratio. The aforementioned halfway point is also reflected here, with an elevated RHODL signalling the presence of new investors but not yet peaked in a way consistent with demand saturation.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe confidence of new investors in the market trend has also remained within the neutral range, highlighting that spending by new buyers is not drastically different from the price of the original acquisition.\n\nDespite the slightly negative sentiment through the recent tumultuous market conditions, the confidence level among new investors is notably higher than both the 2019-2020 and 2021 markets.\n\nLive Chart\n\nNew investors lack of unrealized loss further highlights this robustness, underscoring that we have not seen a drastic decline in investor profitability. This suggests there is limited financial pressure and fear experienced by Bitcoin holders, lessening the likelihood of a descent into a deep bear market at this time.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nA notable divergence between supply and demand forces continues to grow. The demand side of the market has declined markedly since the March ATH, while several measures of the ‘active supply’ continue to compress and constrict. With respect to historical precedence, prior examples of acute tightness across the Bitcoin supply side have been a precursor for a regime of heightened volatility.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nRevisiting the Mean\n\nFollowing a 10% price correction, the Bitcoin market has rebounded back to the $63k level, in an attempt to reclaim the critical Short-Term Holder cost-basis.\n\nCryptoVizArt, UkuriaOC, Glassnode\nOct 8, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBull Market Drawdowns remain relatively shallow but in line with historical bull market uptrends. This highlights both the similarities and the relative resiliency of the current cycle.\nBoth Short-Term Holder positioning and their spending behaviour have largely improved as the spot price attempts to reclaim the Short-Term Holder cost-basis at $62.5k.\nA significant amount of Futures Open Interest remains in place, which may expose the market to deleveraging and liquidation cascades if significant volatility breaks out.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nTechnical Damage Report\n\nThe Bitcoin market is truly unique in that it boasts the deepest liquidity profile at hours where traditional markets are closed for trading, and trades globally in all timezones and jurisdictions. This allows investors to express, trade, and speculate an opinion on the market at any time, which can lead to significant price fluctuations over weekends.\n\nThe recent pullback into the $60k region occurred late in the week and was one of the deepest one-day sell-off events since the 2022 cycle low. However, despite the lighter trade volume typically seen over weekends, the market has managed to recover back to close the week at $63.5k.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhen we evaluate the depth of corrections measured from the local high during bull markets, the 2023-24 drawdown profile is largely in line with previous uptrend cycles. We can also see a relatively high degree of resiliency on the demand side. The maximum drawdown is -26% on a closing basis, which is somewhat shallower than is typically seen during prior cycles.\n\nHowever, the last few months have been the deepest of this up-cycle, which suggests that this has been one of the more challenging periods since the FTX collapse in late 2022.\n\nLive Chart\nKey Pricing Levels\n\nA key tool within the on-chain analysis toolbelt is our ability to assess the average cost basis of various investor cohorts. This provides insight into the financial pressure various groups of investors are experiencing, measured as a derivative of the unrealized paper gains/losses held.\n\nA particularly interesting cohort for understanding near-term price action is the Short-Term Holder cohort, typically characterized as new market demand. The spot price has just accelerated above and reclaimed its critical cost-basis of $62.5k, which is a sign of a relatively constructive nature.\n\nIf the market fails to hold above this level, however, it will put a large cohort of recent buyers under increasing pressure, especially considering the last few months of challenging conditions.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also gauge a more macro outlook by utilizing the True-Market Mean ($47k) and the Active Investor Price ($52.5k). Both of these models provide an estimate of the average cost basis for investors who are active within the current cycle (by discounting lost and long-dormant supply).\n\nThe position of the spot price relative to these two key pricing levels can be considered a zone of interest for differentiating between macro bull and bear markets.\n\nYear to date, the spot price has traded above both of these price levels, except for a brief excursion below the Active Investor Price during the 5-Aug sell-off. This suggests a relatively robust market, which has tended to provide demand support during market drawdowns.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe URPD metric is an extremely useful tool, allowing us to profile the current cost basis of the circulating coin supply. The spot price is located within an extremely large cluster of coins. This suggests that small fluctuations in price can impact the profitability of a substantial number of investors.\n\nThe chart below has marked out the URPD with the critical pricing levels noted above, some key observations can be noted:\n\nThe STH cost basis resides within the middle of this dense cluster, highlighting its pivotal role in gauging near-term investor sentiment.\nTwo large supply nodes are located at the True Market Mean and Active Investor Price, underscoring their importance as support levels.\nIn close proximity to these pricing levels are large ‘air gaps,’ where very few coins have transacted, potentially marking them as points of interest in the event of downside volatility.\n\nThis paints a picture of a market that rests on delicate ground, with a large volume of supply likely to be sensitive to the next major market move.\n\nLive Chart\nA Short-Term Reset\n\nWith Short-Term Holders playing an important role in defining local price action, the balance of their supply held in profit or loss can help distinguish positive or negative tipping points.\n\nBy this metric, there is a clear profit dominance amongst Short-Term holders, with this ratio trading at 1.2. This indicator has also recently broken more than one standard deviation above its 90-day mean, suggesting an initial positive boost to investor sentiment may be underway.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFrom the perspective of Short-Term Holder unrealized profit/loss, we can use a similar analysis framework applied to STH-MVRV. These tools assess the magnitude of unrealized paper gains/losses held by this cohort on average.\n\nHere, we can also observe an improvement in the profitability of new investors, with their MVRV ratio rallying from the lows during the yen-carry trade unwind in early August. STH-MVRV has also reclaimed its 90d moving average, which is another positive sign.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWith both the Supply in Profit/Loss Ratio and STH-MVRV reaching their respective upper statistical bands, we can theorize that new investors have a decent incentive to lock in profit during the prevailing rally.\n\nUsing the same statistical bands applied to Net Realized Profit/Loss by STHs, it becomes evident that profit-taking has intensified during this rally. The magnitude of profit-taking remains relatively small when compared to the March ATH. However, it is still significant enough to reach the upper statistical band.\n\nLive Chart\nIncreasing Speculation in Derivatives Markets\n\nDerivative instruments for Bitcoin remain a crucial component of market structure and have grown significantly over recent years. Despite a surge in the usage of calendar expiring futures, primarily via CME Group instruments, the perpetual swap remains the contract of choice amongst crypto-native traders and speculators.\n\nWe can gauge speculation by futures investors by assessing the cumulative monthly premium that long-side contracts have paid to the short-side over the last 7 days.\n\nWe can see that the total cost of leverage around the March ATH peaked at around ~$120M per week. This has since declined to just $15.3M per week, reflecting a net reduction in long-biased speculation during the recent range-bound market conditions.\n\nHowever, despite the meaningful reduction in trader long bias, the directional premium has recently exceeded its +1σ band, underscoring a potential return of speculative interest.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA substantial $2.5B of futures open interest was forcibly closed during the rally, suggesting a flushing out of short sellers. However, the percentage of OI reduction seen across the top three perpetual exchanges did not surpass the 5% threshold value 🟨.\n\nFrom this, it could be argued that the market remains somewhat susceptible to heightened volatility in either direction, which could squeeze leveraged traders out of their positions.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nBoth Short-Term Holder's investment positioning and spending behaviour have seen a boost in profitability over the last month as the spot price rebounds above their cost-basis. Given the delicate position of the spot price relative to the cost basis of a large volume of the circulating supply, this may help tip the balance back in favor of the bulls.\n\nHowever, speculation appears to be increasing in futures markets, with a significant amount of open interest still in open contracts. With the macro market direction still ambiguous, the market remains vulnerable to heightened volatility, which may fuel the next move in either direction due to deleveraging pressures and liquidations.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Alongside this, there is a multitude of critical on-chain metrics that have also set higher highs, making this an interesting moment in time.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nOct 2, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nWhen comparing Bitcoin’s cyclical price performance since the bear market was low, an uncanny similarity emerges over the prior three cycles, with the index trading at a nearly identical position.\nThere has been a rise in the number of Long-term Holder coins held in loss, as large volumes of BTC acquired near the $73k ATH mature across the 155-day threshold.\nHowever, the magnitude of unrealized loss held by these investors remains small in scale, suggesting minimal financial pressure imposed on their portfolios.\nA clear improvement in Short-Term Holder profitability can be observed throughout the recent rally, providing relief for buyers who recently acquired their coins.\nThe conviction of US ETF investors remains relatively robust, with only minor sell-side pressure taking place, despite being underwater on average inflow cost basis positions.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nCycle Navigation\n\nThe Bitcoin market saw a relief rally back towards the $66k region last week, setting the first technical higher high since June. This price action provides the first inclinations that the structured downtrend may be approaching a phase shift.\n\nThe market pulled back to $60k early this week and is trading at $61.7k at the time of writing.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhen we assess the price performance of Bitcoin from the cycle low, a remarkable similarity in performance emerges despite wildly differing market conditions. The reason for Bitcoin following such a similar path is a regular topic of debate, but it continues to provide an interesting framework for analysts to think about cycle structure and duration.\n\nBoth the 2015-16 🔵, and 2019-20 🟢 periods have traded in an oddly similar manner to the recovery seen in 2023-24 ⚫.\n\nLive Workbench\nDeceptive Long-Term Holder Losses\n\nOne of the most powerful tools in on-chain analysis is our ability to gauge how many coins are held in profit or loss and the magnitude of unrealized paper gains/losses for investors. We can bolster this using cohorts, with the Long and Short-Term Holder cohorts particularly instructive.\n\nWe can compare the Long/Short-Term Holder Supply Ratio to assess the balance between these cohorts. This lens shows a large volume of coins maturing into Long-Term Holder status, pushing this ratio to the highest level since mid-2021.\n\nThis suggests that HODLing persists as the dominant behavior of Bitcoin investors.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nHowever, we are also seeing a notable uptick in Long-Term Holder supply, held at an unrealized loss. This can be attributed to coins acquired in close proximity to the $73k ATH, which are now beginning to mature across the 155-day threshold.\n\nWhilst unrealized losses can be interpreted as a form of financial pressure felt by investors, Long-Term Holder supply tends to remain held throughout periods of volatility.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nIf we break down the proportion of total supply held in the loss by long-term holders, we see a surge in their dominance, with this cohort now accounting for 47.4% of all coins in the loss.\n\nAgain, similarities to the 2013, 2019, and 2021 periods emerge when investors entered a re-accumulation phase.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nDespite LTHs accounting for 47.4% of the supply held in loss, the magnitude of the unrealized ‘paper’ losses held within these coins remains relatively small.\n\nThis is a constructive observation as it suggests that while many ‘top buyers’ are technically underwater on their holdings, the scale of their portfolio drawdown is relatively small, and the financial pressure may be interpreted as minimal.\n\nLive Chart\nShort-Term Holder Profitability Improves\n\nTo balance the equation, we can also look toward the Short-Term Holder cohort, which represents a pool of new demand in the market and tends to be more responsive to market volatility.\n\nThe Short-Term Holder MVRV metric describes the average unrealized profit/loss held by short-term holders. Over recent weeks, this metric has experienced several successive undercuts below the equilibrium value of 1, describing an STH cohort that is, on average, holding an unrealized loss.\n\nHowever, the depth and the duration below 1.0 is unlike that seen during previous bear market structures, such as in 2022. A slight positive divergence is also developing, where the price has generally been flat over the last month, but STH-MVRV is increasing.\n\nBoth of these observations suggest that the positioning and profitability of new investors are improving and, similar to the LTH cohort, may not be as financially stressful as in typical bear market conditions.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe percentage of Short-Term Holder Supply held in profit tells a similar story, with over 62% of their supply now held in a profitable position. From this, two key insights can be drawn:\n\nA significant volume of STH coins have a cost basis located between $53k and $66k\nA higher high in the percent of STH supply in profit has been established, again suggesting their profitability is improving and easing financial pressure on this cohort.\n\nThe recovery also places the Percent Supply in Profit near the long-term average for this metric, which is a noteworthy rebound.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe STH Realized Profit / Loss Ratio has also rebounded strongly, returning into positive territory and seeing profit-taking volumes 14.17 times larger than for loss-taking. From a structural perspective, this provides an extra layer of confluence that the market is in a superior position relative to just a few weeks ago.\n\nLive Workbench\nInstitutional Demand\n\nThe institutional appetite for regulated Bitcoin exposure has been nothing short of phenomenal. The total assets under management within the US Spot ETFs now have a market value of $58B and hold around 4.6% of the circulating Bitcoin supply.\n\nWe can also see a recent uplift in the ETF balances on Glassnode due to the inclusion of holdings within the ‘BTC’ instrument associated with the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWith BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale ranking as the largest US Spot ETFs, we can consider the price-stamping of Bitcoin deposits to their ETFs as a method to estimate the average acquisition cost basis. The cost basis of these instruments ranges from $54.9k to $59.1k.\n\nThis cost-basis model can then approximate a break-even point for ETF investors as a gauge for psychological stress points based on their unrealized profit/loss. As we can see, the price has tested these ETF break-even levels in three key instances since July.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWith the ETFs being a relatively new piece of the Bitcoin market structure, it is helpful to put their influence on the market into perspective and size them up against the traditional spot markets.\n\nIn this final chart, we evaluate the proportion of positive net capital flows associated with introducing ETF instruments.\n\nNext, we compare the value invested into the ETFs 🟩 to the net capital inflow into the Bitcoin asset overall 🔴, measured as the change in the Realized Cap over the same period.\n\nSince early January, the result shows that a non-trivial 4% to 5% of the overall net capital inflow to the Bitcoin market can be associated with coins flowing into US Spot ETFs. Given that this is aligned with their share of the total supply held, we have a reasonable baseline for evaluating their market influence.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe recent market rally has several initial signs that a change in market structure may be beginning to emerge, with Bitcoin printing its first technical higher high since the $73k top.\n\nThe Long-Term Holder cohort is largely in a regime of dominant HODLing and accumulation, while Short-Term Holders have seen a notable resurgence in their profitability. Across several measures, the average Bitcoin investor is in a better and more profitable position compared to just a few weeks ago and is experiencing less financial stress across the board.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nTracing Capital Flows\n\nIn the wake of the Federal Reserve's 0.5% interest rate cut, Bitcoin has reclaimed the Short-Term Holder cost basis of ~$61.9k. This rally could achieve technical significance if the price also holds above the 200-day moving average at $63.9k.\n\nCryptoVizArt, UkuriaOC, Glassnode\nSep 25, 2024 • 6 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBitcoin has reclaimed the Short-Term Holder cost basis ($61.9k) and 200DMA ($63.9k) following a 0.50% interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.\nShort-term holders are under marginally less pressure as prices rise above their cost basis, after a period of net capital outflows.\nNew investors show a degree of resilience, seen in realized losses being of a relatively small magnitude, suggesting confidence in the overall uptrend.\nThe perpetual futures market displays a cautious recovery in sentiment, with gradually increasing demand but still below levels seen during strong bull markets.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nA Shift in Market Gradient\n\nThe capital inflow into the Bitcoin network slowed down after the market reached the March ATH, resulting in diminishing price momentum. This can be confirmed by comparing the smoothed 155-day gradient of Price ⬛ against that of the Realized Price 🟧.\n\nThe market gradient had fallen into negative values over recent weeks, with the realized price gradient being positive, but trending lower. This indicates that the downside in the spot price was more aggressive than the intensity of capital outflows.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe next chart measures the z-score of these two gradients. Negative values can be interpreted as periods of relatively weak demand, resulting in a sustained contraction of prices.\n\nUsing this metric, we can see that the current structure is very similar to the 2019-20 period, where the market experienced an extended consolidation range after a strong rally in Q2-2019.\n\nLive Workbench\nNew Capital Flow Direction\n\nThe current consolidation phase has pushed the spot price below the cost-basis of several short-term holder sub-cohorts since late Jun 2024 (MVRV Ratio <1). This highlights how recent investors have been under financial pressure, nursing increasingly larger unrealized losses.\n\nHowever, despite many new investors being underwater on their holdings, the magnitude of their unrealized losses are notably less severe than the mid-2021 sell-off, and the March 2020 COVID crash.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhen the market enters a prolonged regime of contraction, diminishing returns motivate investors to cash out at lower prices, cutting their losses. Thus, the cost basis of a relatively young supply tails the spot price lower. The repricing of short-term holder supply to lower price values can be characterized as a net capital outflow from the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nTo gauge the direction and intensity of capital flows from the perspective of new investors, we have constructed an indicator that compares the cost basis of two sub-groups (1w-1m as the fast trace, and 1m-3m as the slow trace).\n\nCapital Outflows 🟪 During downwards trending markets, the cost basis of the youngest coins (1w-1m 🟠) declines faster than the older age cohort (1m-3m 🔴). This structure indicates that the overall direction of capital flows is negative, and the intensity of this outflow is proportional to the deviation between these traces.\nCapital Inflow 🟦 During market up-trends, the cost basis of younger coins expands faster than that of the older age band. This indicates that capital is flowing in at a rate proportional to the divergence between these traces.\n\nThe cost basis of younger coins is currently trading below that of older coins, suggesting the market is experiencing a net outflow regime. Utilizing this indicator, a sustainable market reversal may be in its early stages of developing positive momentum.\n\nLive Workbench\nConfidence of New Investors\n\nAs the unrealized losses held by new investors grow during a market correction, their tendency to capitulate at a loss tends to increase accordingly. Short-term holders have been statistically shown to be more sensitive to volatility, making their behavior useful to track around market inflection points.\n\nWhen checked alongside MVRV by Age, the SOPR by Age indicators show almost identical behavior. This confirms that new investors have both been underwater on their holdings and experienced sufficient stress to crystallize those losses.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also assess the intensity of the reaction by Short-Term Holders to any shifts in market sentiment.\n\nThe difference between the cost basis of new investors who are spending 🟠 and the cost basis of all new investors 🔵 shines a light on their aggregate confidence. When normalized by the spot price, this deviation enables us to highlight periods when new investors overreact to extremely high unrealized profit or loss conditions.\n\nOver recent months, new investors who acquired their coins over the last 155 days have shown comparatively higher confidence in the market than previous ‘bearish trends’. The magnitude of losses locked in by this cohort remains relatively low compared to the cost basis of their holdings.\n\nLive Workbench\nA Long-Side Perpetual Premium\n\nWe can use the perpetual futures market to add another dimension to our investigation of the confidence of new capital in the uptrend. First, we employ the Futures Perpetual Funding Rate (7D-MA) to show the appetite of speculators for paying a higher interest rate to take on leverage for long positions.\n\nConsidering the funding rate value of 0.01% is an equilibrium value on many exchanges, we look for deviations above this level as a threshold of bullish sentiment. The recent price bounce has been paired with a relative warming up of long-biased leverage in perpetual markets. This has pushed the weekly average funding rate to 0.05%.\n\nWhilst this is above the equilibrium level, it does not yet indicate a strong or excessive degree of long-biased demand in perpetual markets just yet.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we calculate the cumulative monthly premium that long-side contracts have paid to the short side over the last 30 days, we can see that the total cost of leverage around the March ATH was around ~$120M per month.\n\nThis indicator has plunged to $1.7M per month as of mid-September, with only a modest uptick to $10.8M per month today. Therefore, demand for long-leverage has increased over the last two weeks but is still considerably lower than it was in January 2023. This speaks to a market that has cooled off significantly during this correction.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nThe Bitcoin market has remained within a lengthy consolidation phase, which is very reminiscent of the period from late 2019 and into early 2020. The capital inflow into the Bitcoin network has slowed down since the March ATH, which has challenged Short-Term Holder profitability.\n\nHowever, despite experiencing a local period of net capital outflow, the confidence of new investors in the market has been remarkably robust. In recent weeks, there has also been a very modest uptick in long-side bias in perpetual futures markets.\n\nOverall, this paints a picture of a market that has cooled down from the excesses seen in March, whilst not breaking the sentiment of many new Bitcoin investors.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

The market is characterized by minimal capital inflows and outflows, as the stagnant Realized Cap indicates.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nSep 17, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nMarket demand-side remains lacklustre for digital assets, with the magnitude of both capital inflows and outflows remaining small in scale.\nHODLing remains the primary investor dynamic, with all measures of actively tradable supply declining and large volumes of coins maturing into Long-Term Holder status.\nPrice action has been remarkably stagnant over the past six months, driving all variants of the Sell-Side Risk Ratio to low levels, suggesting an expectation for higher volatility ahead.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nDemand Side Wanes\n\nThe Realized Cap is a foundational metric that provides an assessment of the cumulative capital netflow into and out of the Bitcoin network.\n\nWith the market trading in a downward but range-bound manner for the last six months, both capital inflows and outflows have ground to a halt. The Realized Cap has peaked and plateaued at $622B in the previous two months. This suggests that the majority of coins that are being transacted are doing so within proximity of their original acquisition price.\n\nLive Chart\n\nBy assessing the Net Realized Profit / Loss metric, we can visualize the Realised Cap's first derivative, the daily change in onchain capital flows for Bitcoin. When this metric is positive, it represents net capital creation (coins transacting in profit) or destruction when the metric is negative (coins moving at a loss).\n\nAt present, we can see that both profit and loss forces are largely equal, resulting in a marginal netflow and a general oscillation around the zero bound. This alludes to a degree of equilibrium being established in the market and has some similarities to the Aug-Sep period in 2023.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can consider the Realized Profit and Loss as a measure of the excess capital required for a seller to part ways with their coin. Thus, under this framework, we can utilize this metric as a proxy for gauging market demand by evaluating the seller's willingness to transact at a premium (profit) or a discount (loss).\n\nThe absolute Realized Profit plus Loss has declined significantly since the March ATH, implying that there has been a reduction in overall buy-side pressure within the current price range.\n\nLive Chart\nSupply Side Constricts\n\nHaving assessed the demand side of the market, it becomes prudent to gauge measures of the supply side to provide a holistic analysis of the two opposing market forces.\n\nThe ‘Hot Supply’ metric is one proxy we can use to estimate the coins readily available to trade and transact. This supply volume represents the wealth held within coins aged one week or less. Leaning on the assumption that a short holding time in the market increases the probability that the coin will transact again, as discovered in our study of Long and Short-Term Holders, we consider this distinct age group as one of the most readily available in response to market fluctuations.\n\nThe wealth currently held by coins aged less than one week has declined into the low liquidity zone, accounting for just 4.7% of the aggregate network wealth. This highlights a continually constricting supply side, as the vast majority of coins are aged older than one week.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe see a similar story told via the supply divergences chart. Here, we profile several measures of ‘available supply,’ such as Short-Term Holder and Highly Liquid supply. We compare this against measures of ‘saved or stored supply’ such as Long-Term Holder or Vaulted supply.\n\nOne observation is the prevalence and dominance of HODLing behaviour amongst market participants, leading to a rapid increase in ‘stored supply.’ This speaks to an overall tightening supply side as the volume of coins available to actively transact continues to reduce.\n\nLive Chart\nStablecoin Liquidity Rises\n\nStablecoins remain the preferred quote currency on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. As such, the growth in total stablecoin capital can be utilized as a proxy for investor demand and appetite.\n\nThe Aggregate Stablecoin Supply is on the rise, residing just under the ATH at $160.4B. This can be considered as a constructive sign suggesting the build-up of crypto-native dollar-denominated capital, which is easily able to be exchanged into digital assets. However, we can also infer that this Stablecoin capital is not actively rotating into risk assets at this stage.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe SSR Oscillator compares the Market Capitalization of Bitcoin against the total circulating stablecoin supply. This can be considered under the following interpretation:\n\nWhen the SSR is low, the current stablecoin supply has more \"buying power\" to purchase BTC\nWhen the SSR is high, the current stablecoin supply has less \"buying power\" to purchase BTC\n\nThe divergence between a range-bound Bitcoin market cap and a growing stablecoin supply has pushed the SSR Oscillator to a historic low. This suggests that investor stablecoin-based buying power is increasing, with a recursive effect where higher purchasing power can lead to an improving demand side in the future.\n\nLive Chart\nHeightened Volatility Expectations\n\nWith price action oscillating within a well-defined range over the last six months, volatility begins to tighten and compress, akin to a coiling spring. After such a lengthy period without a significant macro movement, there is a growing expectation for higher volatility on the road ahead.\n\nWe can gauge the compression of market volatility by measuring the percent range between the highest and lowest price ticks over the last 180 days. By this metric, only Aug 2023 and May 2016 exhibit a tighter 180-day price range. This highlights the relative tightness of the current market structure.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can support this volatility assessment by using the Sell-Side Risk Ratio. This tool assesses the absolute sum of realized profit and loss locked in by investors relative to the asset size (the Realized Cap). We can consider this metric under the following framework:\n\nHigh values indicate that investors spend coins at a significant profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium and usually follows a high volatility price move.\nLow values indicate that most coins are being spent relatively close to their break-even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‘profit and loss’ within the current price range and usually describes a low volatility environment.\n\nThe Sell-Side Risk Ratio has now dropped below the low-value band, suggesting minimal profit and loss-taking is occurring within the current range. The interpretation here is that equilibrium has been reached, and there is a need for further range expansion to incentivize investors to spend their coins (take profit or loss).\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe above assessment is held solely when assessing the Short-Term Holder cohort. Historically, the STH Sell-Side Risk is at one of its lowest values, highlighting a remarkable absence of demand for new investors.\n\nLive Chart\n\nSimilarly, the Long-Term Holder Sell-Side Risk Ratio has also dropped below its low-valuation band, suggesting that even mature investors have slowed their onchain interactions within the current price range.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe current state of the Bitcoin market is one of equilibrium and reduced activity. On the demand side, capital flows have slowed significantly, and the Realized Cap remained effectively unchanged over the last two months.\n\nSimultaneously, the supply side is tightening, and there is a notable decline in readily available coins. However, the uptick in stablecoin supplies carries more future purchasing power, creating tension between current inactivity and potential future demand. This creates a sort of coiled-spring effect in the market and alludes to a regime of higher volatility on the road ahead.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Network Overview\n\nThe competitiveness of the Mining landscape and their conviction in the Bitcoin Network continues to rise, with the Hash Rate blasting towards new ATHs. However, investors remain unconvinced in the short term, with exchange-related onchain volumes beginning to languish.\n\nCryptoVizArt, UkuriaOC, Glassnode\nSep 10, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nHash Rate remains just shy of ATHs, as continued investment by Miners demonstrates immense conviction in the Bitcoin Network despite depressed revenues.\nInvestor interactions with exchanges are in decline, with contracting volumes across the board suggesting there is a diminished appetite for investors and trade.\nBoth the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are exhibiting outflows, however, investor interest in the Bitcoin ETFs remain significantly larger in scale and magnitude.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nMiners\n\nMiners remain fundamental participants in the Bitcoin network and act as the primary production source for new coins. Miners provide the hashing power used to discover the next valid block, with the network autonomously rewarding them with newly issued coins and transaction fees.\n\nThis makes mining an exceptionally challenging industry, as they have control over neither the input cost of energy nor the output cost of BTC.\n\nDespite choppy and uncertain market conditions, Bitcoin miners have continued to install new ASIC hardware, pushing the overall hash rate higher (14D-MA), reaching 666.4EH/s, and just 1% shy of the ATH.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs the hash rate increases, so does the target difficulty to successfully mine a valid block. The Bitcoin protocol automatically adjusts the difficulty to account for rising and falling hash rate on the network.\n\nPresently, the average required number of hashes to mine a block is 338k exahash. This is the second largest difficulty throughout Bitcoin’s lifespan, highlighting the ever-growing competitiveness of the mining industry.\n\nLive Chart\n\nNevertheless, a significant decline in Miner Revenue can be seen since the market price peaked at a new ATH in March. A significant portion of this revenue decline can be attributed to falling fee pressure. This is driven by declining demand for monetary transfers and falling fees generated from Runes and Inscription-related transactions.\n\nMiner revenue associated with the block subsidy remains relatively high due to spot prices trading above $55k, however, remains around 22% below the previous ATH.\n\nBlock Subsidy Revenue: $824M\nTransaction Fee Revenue: $20M\nLive Chart\n\nAs revenues decline, we can infer that a degree of income stress may start to develop. We can estimate the percentage of the mined supply spent by miners over a 30-day window to measure whether this is the case.\n\nDue to the competitive and capital-intensive nature of the mining industry, miners have historically needed to distribute a majority of the coins mined to cover input costs. Interestingly, Miners have transitioned from net distribution over the mined supply to now retaining a portion of mined supply in their treasury reserves.\n\nThis highlights an interesting development, as Miners tend to be pro-cyclical, being sellers during drawdowns and HODLers during uptrends. The uptick in hash rate and difficulty represents an increasingly expensive production cost for BTC, which may adversely affect miner profitability in the near future.\n\nLive Chart\nSettlement Slowdown\n\nThe magnitude of volume settled on-chain can also provide colour into the degree of network adoption and health. When filtering for entity-adjusted volume, the network is currently processing and settling around $6.2B worth of transaction volume per day.\n\nHowever, settlement volume is beginning to fall towards its yearly average, suggesting a marked cooling off in network usage and throughput. Generally speaking, this is a net negative observation.\n\nLive Chart\n\nReduced Trading Appetite\n\nIn an ever-evolving market landscape, centralized exchanges have remained the centrepiece venue for speculation activity and price discovery. Therefore, we can evaluate onchain volumes aggregated across these venues as a proxy for investor activity and appetite for speculation.\n\nRunning a similar 30d/365d momentum cross-over for exchange-related inflows and outflows, we can see that the monthly average volume has fallen well below the yearly. This underscores a decline in investor demand and less trading by speculators within the current price range.\n\nLive Chart\n\nNext, we will look at spot trade volumes at exchange venues. Here, we apply a 90d MinMax scalar, which normalizes the value set over a range of 1 to -1 relative to the maximum and minimum values of the selected period.\n\nFrom this, a similar observation can be ascertained, with spot volume momentum continuing to decay. This adds more weight to the idea that there has been a notable decline in trade activity over the last quarter.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe CVD metric can estimate the present net balance between market buying and selling pressure in spot markets. Utilizing the same methodology, we note that investor sell-pressure has been increasing across the last 90d, contributing toward the downward tilt in price action.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFinally, we can evaluate the momentum of price action for the Bitcoin price. Here, a degree of indecision can be seen, with positive and negative data points occurring over August. This starkly compares to the two previously highlighted indicators, both of which have been decisively negative across the same period.\n\nLive Chart\n\nCombining the MinMax Transformations for Volume, CVD and Price Action, respectively, we are able to produce a Sentiment Heatmap concerning the values of the features between 1 and -1. We can consider this over the following framework:\n\n🟢 Values of 1 suggest High Risk\n🟡 Values of 0 suggest Moderate Risk\n🔴 Values of -1 Suggest Low Risk\n\nAll three indicators suggest the market is entering a low-risk zone relative to the last 90 days of data points. Such confluence among the discussed spot indicators can be translated into diminishing ( Spot Volume Momentum ) sell volume ( CVD < 0) while price action is slowly chopping downward. Such a structure may be susceptible to external forces and could potentially break out on either side if the tides shift.\n\nETFs\n\nThe Ethereum ETFs have now followed the launch of the US Bitcoin ETFs in January in August. These two events mark a “Crossing the Rubicon” event for the Digital Asset Ecosystem, providing US traditional markets with an accessible access point for exposure to the leading two cryptocurrencies.\n\nStarting with the Bitcoin ETFs, we can see that net capital flows in USD have softened since Aug 2024 and are now reporting an outflow of $107M/week.\n\nLive Chart\n\nDemand for the more recent Ethereum ETFs has been relatively tepid, experiencing a net negative outflow. This is driven primarily by redemptions from the Grayscale ETHE product, which has not been counterbalanced by sufficient inflow demand across the other instruments.\n\nOn aggregate, the Ethereum ETFs have experienced a total outflow of $-13.1M. This highlights a disparity in the magnitude of demand between BTC and ETH, at least within the context of current market conditions.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo approximate the impact of the ETFs on the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets, we have normalized the bias in ETF netflow volume by the corresponding Spot Volumes. This ratio enables us to directly compare the relative weight of ETFs in each market.\n\nAs shown in the chart below, the relative influence of ETFs on the Ethereum market is equivalent to a range of ±1% of the spot volume, compared to ±8% for the Bitcoin ETF. This suggests that despite normalization, the appetite for the Bitcoin ETF remains an order of magnitude larger than its Ethereum counterpart.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nMiners continue to demonstrate immense conviction in the Bitcoin Network, with the Hash Rate just shy of ATHs despite collapsing revenues. However, as Miners tend to be pro-cyclical, being sellers during drawdowns and HODLers during uptrends, a degree of sell-side pressure can be expected in the event of further drawdowns.\n\nAlongside this, Investor interaction with exchanges continues to fall, with contracting volumes across the board, suggesting there is a diminished appetite for investors and trade. This is also apparent across the Institutional landscape, with the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs exhibiting net outflows.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nShort-Term Holder Stress\n\nThe Bitcoin market has continued to experience downward pressure over recent months despite the average Bitcoin investor remaining profitable overall. However, the Short-Term Holder cohort remains heavily underwater on their holdings, making them a source of risk for the time being.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nSep 4, 2024 • 6 min read\nExecutive Summary\nOn average, BTC investors hold relatively small unrealized losses compared to prior cycles, suggesting a relatively favourable overall position.\nHowever, Short-Term Holder unrealized losses remain quite elevated, indicating they are the primary cohort at risk.\nProfit and Loss-taking activities remain remarkably light, with critical metrics such as the Sell-Side Risk Ratio alluding to a potential for heightened volatility in the near future.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nA Downwards Tilt\nBull Market Correction\n\nPrice action has stagnated, and investor sentiment has been apathetic over the last six months. However, a notable change has occurred over the previous three months, with downward pressure increasing and causing the market to experience its most significant drawdown of the cycle.\n\nNevertheless, from a macro perspective, the spot price is trading around -22% below the ATH, which remains a relatively shallow drawdown compared to historical bull market regimes.\n\nLive Workbench\nCurrent Market Pressures\n\nWith downward price pressure increasing, it becomes prudent to assess the unrealized loss held by investors to evaluate the financial stress they are experiencing.\n\nFrom the perspective of the broader market, unrealized losses remain historically low. Total unrealized losses amount to just 2.9% of the Bitcoin market cap, which is historically low.\n\nThis suggests that the aggregate investor remains relatively profitable, even in the face of continued price declines.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we take the ratio between total Unrealized Profit and Unrealized Loss, we can see that profits remain 6x larger than losses, supporting the above observation. Around 20% of trading days have seen this ratio above the current value, underscoring the surprisingly robust financial position of the average investor.\n\nLive Workbench\nShort-Term Concerns\n\nThe Short-Term Holder cohort, representing new demand in the market, appears to be shouldering the majority of the market pressure. Their unrealized losses dominate overall, and the magnitude consistently increased over the last few months.\n\nHowever, even for this cohort, the magnitude of their Unrealized Losses relative to the market cap is not yet in full-scale bear market territory and more closely resembles the choppy 2019 period.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can bolster the above observation by assessing the STH MVRV Ratio, which has collapsed below the breakeven value of 1.0. This metric trades at levels similar to Aug 2023 during the recovery rally after the FTX failure.\n\nThis tells us that the average new investor is holding an unrealized loss. Generally speaking, until the spot price reclaims the STH cost basis of $62.4k, there is an expectation for further market weakness.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can increase our confidence in this assessment by inspecting the subsets within the STH investor cohort. Presently, all age bands within the STH cohort are holding an unrealized loss, with their average cost basis as follows:\n\n🔴 1d-1w: $59.0k\n🟠 1w-1m: $59.9k\n🔵 1m-3m: $63.6k\n🟣 3m-6m: $65.2k\nLive Workbench\nInvestor Reactions\n\nAssessing unrealized losses provides crucial insight into the pressure that market investors are experiencing. We can then supplement this with an analysis of the volumes of profit and loss realized (locked-in) to better understand how these investors respond to this pressure.\n\nBeginning with realized profit, we can see a drastic decline following the $73k ATH, indicating that most coins spent since then have locked in increasingly small profit volumes.\n\nLive Chart\n\nMoving toward realized losses, we note that loss-taking events are elevated, and trade is rising toward higher levels as the market downtrend progresses.\n\nThe loss-taking events are not yet at the extreme levels seen during the mid-2021 sell-off or the 2022 bear market. However, the gradual higher drift does indicate some fear creeping into investor behaviour patterns.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFrom the lens of the Sell-Side Risk Ratio, we can see that the total realized profit and loss are relatively small compared to the total market size. We can interpret this metric under the following framework:\n\nHigh values indicate that investors spend coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium and usually follows a high volatility price move.\nLow values indicate that most coins are being spent relatively close to their break-even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‘profit and loss’ within the current price range and usually describes a low volatility environment.\n\nThe Sell-Side Risk Ratio has declined into the lower band, suggesting that most coins transacted on-chain are doing so close to their original acquisition price. This suggests a progressive saturation of profit and loss-taking activities within the current price range.\n\nHistorically, this alludes to an expectation for heightened volatility shortly and is similar to the 2019 period.\n\nLive Workbench\nNavigating the Cycle\n\nDuring downtrends, patience and HODLing naturally become a dominant market dynamic. A substantial amount of Long-Term Holder coins were spent for profit into the March ATH, creating a net supply overhang.\n\nMore recently, LTHs have slowed down their profit-taking, and supply accumulated during the ATH run-up is gradually maturing into Long-Term Holder status. However, historical examples of LTH supply increasing like this show that this usually occurs during the transition towards a bear market.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nCompounding the above observation, we note that the wealth held by new-demand investors has declined over recent months as coins mature and transition into Long-Term Holder status.\n\nThe percentage of wealth held by new investors did not reach the elevated limits experienced during previous ATH distribution events. This may indicate that the 2024 peak is more aligned with the 2019 mid-cycle high rather than the macro highs seen in 2017 and 2021.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo conclude our analysis, we shall consult a simplified framework for thinking about historical Bitcoin market cycles using key onchain pricing levels:\n\n🔴 Deep Bear Market: Prices trade below the Realized Price.\n🔵 Early Bull Market: Prices trade between Realized Price and True Market Mean.\n🟠 Enthusiastic Bull Market: Prices trade between the ATH and True Market Mean.\n🟢 Euphoric Bull Market: Prices trade above the previous cycles ATH.\n\nUnder this framework, price action remains within the Enthusiastic Bull Market structure, which is a constructive observation. However, in the event of a local downturn, the pricing level of $51k remains a critical area of interest that must be maintained for further price appreciation.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWith Bitcoin residing only a mere 22% drawdown from its ATH, a considerably shallower drawdown than prior cycles, the average BTC investor remains vastly profitable, highlighting the robustness of their positioning.\n\nNevertheless, the Short-Term Holder cohort continues to carry elevated unrealized losses, indicating they are the primary cohort at risk and the expected source of sell-side pressure in the event of a downturn.\n\nAlongside this, profit and Loss-taking activities remain remarkably light, suggesting a saturation of our current range with critical metrics such as the sell-side risk ratio, which alludes to a potential for heightened volatility in the near future.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Return to Equilibrium\n\nMarket speculation remains relatively subdued for Bitcoin, with investors locking in only marginal profit and losses, and a reset across perpetual swap markets. Historically, periods of quiet and calm market structure are short-lived, and often precede an expectation for heightened volatility.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nAug 27, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nNet capital flows into the Bitcoin assets have markedly cooled, with only marginal profit and loss-taking events by investors.\nLoss-taking events are almost exclusively associated with the Short-Term Holder cohort.\nHowever, a significant proportion of supply held by this cohort is transitioning into Long-Term Holder status, having been held for at least 155 days.\nSpeculation in the perpetual swap market has experienced a full reset, suggesting a cooling off of speculative interest and long-biased leverage.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nLiquidity\n\nOver the last few months, net capital inflows into the Bitcoin asset have begun to slow down. This suggests a degree of equilibrium is reached between investors taking profit and loss.\n\nNotably, capital inflows into the Bitcoin market are infrequently this quiet, with 89% of days experiencing a capital inflow larger than today (excluding during loss dominant bear markets). Also of note is that similar periods of inactivity tend to precede a significant uptick in volatility on the road ahead.\n\nThe Realized Cap remains at an ATH value of $619B, supported by a remarkable net inflow of $217B since the $15k low established in Dec 2022.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe MVRV Ratio is a powerful tool that enables us to gauge investors' average unrealized profit.\n\nOver the last two weeks, the MVRV Ratio has tested its all-time average value of 1.72. This critical level has historically marked a transition point between a macro bull vs bear market trend. Approximately 51% of trading days have a MVRV value closing above the mean value.\n\nThis suggests that investor profitability has essentially reset to an equilibrium position and that the excitement and exuberance after the ETF launch have cooled off completely.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA similar story is echoed in the percentage of supply in profit metric, which provides a read on the global profitability of the supply.\n\nLike the MVRV Ratio, this oscillator has returned to its long-standing mean value. Previous instances where a similar retest of this level occurred are visible in late 2016, throughout the choppy 2019 period and during the mid-2021 sell-off.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Sell-Side Risk Ratio is another powerful tool which can assess the degree of equilibrium the market has reached. We can consider this metric under the following framework:\n\nHigh values indicate that investors spend coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium and usually follows a high volatility price move.\nLow values indicate that most coins are being spent relatively close to their break-even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‘profit and loss’ within the current price range and usually describes a low volatility environment.\n\nPresently, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio has fallen into the lower band, suggesting that most coins moved on-chain are transacting near their original acquisition price. Similar to the metrics covered earlier, this precedes a new regime of heightened volatility.\n\nLive Chart\nShort-Term Stress\n\nDiving deeper into these profit and loss-taking activities, we can see that the magnitude of net realized profit/loss is declining.\n\nNet realized profit/loss is currently at a value of +$15M/day, a far cry from the $3.6B/day of capital inflow experienced as the market set the $73k ATH in March. Typically, this metric returns to a neutral level near inflection points such as a continuation of the trend or a reversal back into a macro scale bearish trend.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAfter setting the ATH in March, the confidence of new investors was tested by choppy sideways price action for several months. During this process, a significant volume of the Bitcoin supply has remained tightly held and is within the 3-month to 6-month age band.\n\nHistorically, the supply held within this 3-6m age band tends to peak soon after a major market peak is established, often during the correction which follows. A portion of these new investors then decide to HODL through the choppy conditions, eventually becoming long-term investors. Many others exit their position and realize the loss.\n\nCurrently, coins aged 3m-6m account for over 12.5% of the circulating supply, with a structure similar to the mid-2021 sell-off, but also during the height of the 2018 bear market.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe chart below aims to break this cohort down further and compare the supply held within the 3-6m age band vs the supply which has capitulated out at a loss. We start with the held supply aged 3-6m shown in 🟠, then overlay the volume transferred in a loss by this cohort 🟥.\n\nFrom this, we can observe a significant surge in loss-taking events since the start of July, whilst the aggregate supply held started to decline. In terms of magnitude, the capitulation was of a scale similar to major market inflection points in the past.\n\nThe supply which remains in this age band is increasingly close to migrating into Long-Term Holder status, representing coins that are statistically less likely to be spent on a given day.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAnother method for visualizing this migration of coins into LTH status is via the URPD metric, segregated for Long and Short-Term Holders. Here, we can see that over +480k BTC was acquired above the current spot price and is now classified as LTH supply 🟦.\n\nThis also means these LTH coins are now held at an unrealized loss.\n\nLive Engine Room\nVolatility\n\nIn this final section, we will add our analysis of perpetual swap markets, which provide a read on the appetite for speculation and leverage across Bitcoin markets.\n\nIn general, there has been a marked decline in liquidation volumes in recent months, especially relative to the excitement around the March ATH. This suggests that the appetite for speculation has declined and suggests a more spot-dominated market regime for the time being.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we compare the monthly price volatility against the net liquidation volumes, we can see a strong correlation between the two factors. This underscores how market volatility is often amplified by a squeezing of leveraged positions, as traders find themselves offside when the market moves.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also look into the ratio between price and net liquidation volume volatility for another relative read on the market's appetite for leverage.\n\nWhat we find is that this ratio is declining towards levels not seen since Feb 2022. This reinforces the notion that traders are less willing to take on higher-risk positions, suggesting there has been a significant reset in speculative interest.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis phenomenon can also be observed across the broader digital asset ecosystem, with a vast swathe of tokens now displaying a neutral funding rate. This underscores the idea that a major reset in speculative interest has occurred across the entire market, and therefore, spot markets are likely to be in the driver's seat for the near term.\n\nLive Derivatives Engine Room\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nA degree of equilibrium is appearing across both the On-Chain domain and the Perpetual Futures Market. This is observable through the languishment of profit and loss-taking activities, as well as the return to neutrality in funding rates materializing across the vast Digital Asset universe. This suggests a significant decline in speculation across market investors, regardless of instrument or asset class.\n\nAlongside this, the market has remained within a structurally ordered downtrend for over 5 months as a period of consolidation and accumulation ensues. However, with respect to historical preference, periods of quiet and calm market structure are short-lived and often precede an expectation for heightened volatility.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Supporting this, Bitcoin Long-Term Holders remain steadfast in their conviction, with significant accumulation pressure below the surface.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nAug 20, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nSince the cycle low established in Nov 2022, Bitcoin Dominance has continued to climb, now commanding 56% of the total crypto market capitalization.\nDespite tumultuous and choppy price action, the conviction of Long-Term Holders remains steadfast and unfazed, with a clear preference to accumulate and HODL coins.\nShort-Term Holders have carried the brunt of the losses during the recent downturn. However, the degree of locked-in losses suggests a possible overreaction towards the event.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nMarket Overview\n\nSince the cycle low established in Nov 2022, capital continues to accrue towards the major asset end of the digital asset risk curve. Bitcoin Dominance has risen from non-trivial 38% in Nov-2022 to a staggering 56% of the total digital asset market today.\n\nAs the second largest asset in the ecosystem, Ethereum has recorded a dominance decline of 1.5%, remaining relatively flat over the past two years. Stablecoins and the wider Altcoin sector have experienced a more pronounced decline of 9.9% and 5.9%, respectively.\n\n🟠 Bitcoin Dominance: 38.7% (Nov 2022) —> 56.2% (Current)\n🔵 Ethereum Dominance 16.8% —> 15.2%\n🟢 Stablecoin Dominance 17.3% —> 7.4%\n🟣 Altcoin Dominance 27.2% —> 21.3%\nLive Workbench\n\nHowever, when we assess the Net Capital Change across the major assets, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Stablecoins exhibit a net positive capital inflow. Only 34% of trading days have seen a larger 30-day USD inflow, even though the market has generally contracted since the March ATH.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nNext, we can utilize the Major Asset Buy-Side vs Sell-Side metric, which seeks to identify shifts in capital depending on the preference of exchange inflow volumes. This can be considered under the following framework:\n\nValues near zero suggest a neutral regime, where buy-side inflows are the same magnitude as BTC+ETH sell-side inflows.\n🟢 Positive values suggest a net buy-side regime, where buy-side inflows of stablecoins exceed BTC+ETH sell-side inflows.\n🔴 Negative values suggest a net sell-side regime, where buy-side inflows of stablecoins are less than BTC+ETH sell-side inflows.\n\nSince the new ATH creation in March 2024, sell-side pressure has subsided and is now recording the first positive data point since June 2023 ($91.8M/day).\n\nLive Workbench\nLong-Term Holders\n\nAmidst tumultuous market conditions as of late, Long-Term Holders have been locking in a reasonably consistent $138M in profit per day. With each transaction, a buyer and a seller are matched, with supply and demand imbalances resolved via price changes.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that this ~$138M/day in LTH sell-side pressure is a read for the daily capital inflows required to absorb supply and keep prices steady. While market conditions have been choppy, prices are generally flat over the last few months, suggesting a form of equilibrium is being reached.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe Realized Profit / Loss Ratio for Long-Term Holders is a metric we can use to assess cyclical behavior of this cohort. We note that this metric remains elevated, although is experiencing a substantial decline from the peak. This indicates that long-term investors are in the process of cooling off profit-taking activities.\n\nNotably, during the March 2024 ATH, this metric reached a similar altitude to prior market tops. In both the 2013 and 2021 cycles, the metric declined to similar levels prior to resuming an uptrend in price. In 2017-18, however, this decline was one way, as the market entered a loss-dominant bear market.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nFrom the perspective of Long-Term Holder SOPR, we can see that coins are locking in an average profit margin of +75%, and LTH-SOPR remains elevated at this time.\n\nLive Chart\n\nUtilizing our Binary Spending Indicator for LTHs, the aforementioned slowdown in Long-Term Holder spending can be seen.\n\nLTH supply is rapidly increasing at present. When we consider that the 155-day threshold for LTH status is near the March ATH, this provides an indication of the volume of supply acquired during the ATH run-up, which remains held. This highlights that HODLing behavior is significantly outpacing spending behavior.\n\nLive Workbench\nA Psychological Correlation\n\nMoving toward the inverse cohort, the Short-Term Holders, we can measure the intensity of unrealized financial stress experienced by recent buyers. We can observe this dynamic using the STH-MVRV Ratio metric, with a 30-day average applied.\n\nSTH-MVRV has recently contracted below the equilibrium value of 1.0, suggesting that the average new investors now hold an unrealized loss.\n\nPeriods of brief unrealized loss pressure are common during bull markets. However, sustained periods where STH-MVRV trades below 1.0 can lead to a higher likelihood of investor panic and precede a more severe bearish market trend.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWith unrealized losses increasing, an expectation of an eventual investor capitulation grows. Such events are characterized by significant losses being locked in via spent coins.\n\nEvaluating the periods of high-loss realization in the market by new investors can be seen when STH-SOPR trades below 1.0.\n\nFrom this lens, we can also see that STH-SOPR trades below 1.0, indicating a degree of realized loss-taking activities by new investors. This adds weight to the case that the market is at a decision point, and the price is marginally below the comfort point of STHs.\n\nLive Chart\n\nDespite the correlation between unrealized and realized activities, new investors can overreact to their portfolio being held at a relatively high unrealized profit (or loss). Such over-reactions are a key feature of markets, where the emotional response of investors results in their realizing an excessive profit (or loss) at inflection points, forming both local and macro tops (or bottoms).\n\nThe chart below compares the spent cost-basis of new investors who decided to transact against the average cost-basis of all investors who still hold. The deviation between these two metrics provides insight into the magnitude of potential overreactions.\n\nThe bull market corrections seen throughout our current cycle have experienced only a slight deviation between the spent and holding cost basis. From this, it could be argued a modest overreaction may have occurred as the market sold off below $50k.\n\nLive Workbench\nNavigating Investor Cycles\n\nIn the above section, we utilized the MVRV and SOPR metrics, which consider investors' general profit and loss positioning. This section will isolate solely for coins held and transacted in a loss.\n\nBy evaluating the Relative Unrealized Loss metric for new investors, we can directly measure the unrealized financial stress that new investors are shouldering.\n\nPresently, the magnitude of Unrealized Loss relative to the STH Market Cap remains relatively low compared to historic capitulation events. The magnitude of loss held by the market is arguably similar to prior bull market corrections.\n\nLive Chart\n\nHowever, we can see a divergence in this correlation when we compare the build-up of Unrealized Losses to those locked in by spent coins (Realized Losses). Realized Losses tricking notably higher highlights the moderate overreaction we described above.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAssessing the cumulative 90-day realized loss and the average unrealized loss for STHs, we can visually highlight the confluence and correlation between these two measures.\n\nDuring cyclical price lows, the magnitude of realized and unrealized loss tends to spike between 10% and 60% of total STH holdings. By this measure, the magnitude of both unrealized and realized losses remains relatively small compared to previous major bottom-forming events.\n\nOne constructive analogue would be the similarity between the current structure and the 2016-2017 cycle, where the described relative metrics traded below a consistent ceiling of ~10%.\n\nFrom this, we could argue that the hit taken to investor sentiment may not be as severe as it may seem at face value.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWith a degree of uncertainty rife amongst market investors, capital continues to flow down the risk curve, leading to a significant expansion in Bitcoin dominance, with the leading asset now commanding a staggering 56% of the total market capitalization.\n\nIn spite of the tempestuous and choppy price action, the resolve of Long-Term Holders remains resolute, with a clear preference for HODL and acquiring coins. Alternatively, Short-Term Holders have carried the vast majority of the losses across the recent downturn. Nonetheless, the degree of locked-in losses suggests a possible overreaction towards the event.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Return to HODLing\n\nWith the market currently digesting the largest downtrend of the cycle, indecision amongst digital asset investors remains apparent. However, below the surface, a distinct return to HODLing and accumulation appears to be underway.\n\nCryptoVizArt, UkuriaOC, Glassnode\nAug 13, 2024 • 6 min read\nExecutive Summary\nAfter several months of relatively heavy distribution pressures, the behavior of Bitcoin holders appears to be rotating back towards HODLing and accumulation.\nActivity in spot markets shows that there has been a net bias towards sell-side pressure of late, and this has not yet completely subsided.\nCompared to ATH breaks in past cycles, there is currently a relatively large percentage of network wealth held by the Long-Term Holder cohort.\nOverall, on-chain conditions speak to an undertone of high conviction amongst the Bitcoin holder-base.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nCoinbase + Glassnode \nLive Webinar\n\nQ3 Guide to Crypto Markets\n\nRegister Here\nA Return to HODLing\n\nAs the market begins to slowly recover from the sell-off last week, there is a discernible level of uncertainty, and indecision amongst digital asset investors. Nevertheless, when analyzing the onchain response of investors to these choppy market conditions, a trend of a preference for HODLing is beginning to emerge.\n\nSince the Bitcoin price ATH was established in March, the market faced an extensive period of supply distribution, with participation by wallets of all sizes. Over the last few weeks, this trend is showing early signs of reversing, particularly for the largest wallet sizes which are often associated with ETFs. These large wallets appear to be returning to a regime of accumulation.\n\nLive in Glassnode Engine Room\n\nThe Accumulation Trend Score (ATS) metric assesses a weighted balance change across the market. This metric also suggests there is a shift back towards accumulation dominant behavior.\n\nThe aforementioned shift towards accumulation has contributed to the ATS recording its highest possible value of 1.0, suggesting significant accumulation throughout the last month.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis observation is echoed across Long-Term Holders (LTH), who heavily divested during the run up to the ATH. This cohort have now returned to a preference for HODLing, with a total volume of +374k BTC migrating into LTH status over the last 3-months.\n\nFrom this, we can infer that the propensity for investors to hold onto their coins is now a larger force relative to their spending pressures.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also assess the 7-day change in LTH supply as a tool to assess rates of change in their aggregate balance.\n\nWe can see substantial LTH distribution, typical of macro topping formations, into the March ATH. Fewer than 1.7% of trading days have ever recording a larger distribution pressure. More recently, this metric has returned to positive territory, indicating that the LTH cohort are expressing a preference for holding onto their coins.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nDespite the aggressive distribution from April to July, the spot price has continued to trade above the Active Investor Cost Basis, which represents the average acquisition price of active coins in the market.\n\nThe Active Investor’s Cost-Basis can be considered as a key threshold delineating bullish and bearish investor sentiment. Since the market managed to find support near this level speaks to a degree of underlying strength, suggesting investors are generally still anticipating positive market momentum in the short-to-medium-term.\n\nLive Workbench\nEvaluating Bias in Spot Markets\n\nWith the market within a technical downtrend, we can employ the CVD metric to estimate the present net balance between market buying and selling pressure in spot markets.\n\nThis metric can in turn be used to assess mid-term market momentum, as well as any headwinds or tailwinds for price. Since the formation of a new ATH, we note there has been a consistent regime of net sell-side pressure.\n\nLive Chart\n\nPositive CVD values suggest a net buy-side pressure, where as negative values infer a net sell-side pressure.\n\nWhen we analyze the yearly median value of Spot CVD, we can see that the median value has fluctuated between -$22m and -$50m over the last 2 years, suggesting the presence of a net-sell side bias.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nIf we consider this long-standing median as a baseline for CVD equilibrium, we can produce an adjusted variant of the metric, accounting and correcting for this implicit sell-side bias.\n\nWhen comparing the Adjusted Spot CVD (30d SMA) against the Monthly Percentage Price Change, an intriguing confluence can be found.\n\nUnder this framework, the recent failure to break above the $70k zone can be partially explained by weakness in spot demand (negative adj-CVD). Alternatively, a potential recovery of demand in the spot market can be confirmed when the Adj-CVD metric returns to positive values.\n\nLive Workbench\nCycle Navigation\n\nChoppy sideways price action in recent months has motivated a notable slow-down in the distribution pressure by LTHs. This has led to the percentage of network wealth held by this cohort to firstly stabilize, and then recommence growing.\n\nDespite the substantial sell-side pressure by LTHs into the market ATH, wealth held by longer-term investors remains historically elevated when compared to previous all time high breakouts.\n\nThis indicates that there is a potential for further divestment pressure by LTHs should the BTC price appreciate in the future. It also suggests that even though prices have traded sideways, to downwards of late, these investors are increasingly unwilling to part ways with their coins at lower prices.\n\nBoth of these observations speak to a more patient and resilient holder-base, despite choppy market conditions.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFinally, we can bolster this assessment using the LTH Sell-Side Risk Ratio. This tool gauges the absolute sum of realised profit and loss locked in by investors, relative to the size of the asset (the Realized Cap). We can consider this metric under the following framework:\n\nHigh values indicate that investors are spending coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium, and usually follows a high volatility price move.\nLow values indicate that the majority of coins are being spent relatively close to their break even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‘profit and loss’ within the current price range, and usually describes a low volatility environment.\n\nThe LTH Sell-Side Risk ratio remains at a lower level compared to prior ATH breaks. This implies that the magnitude of profit taken by the LTH cohort is comparatively small relative to previous market cycles. This also infers that this cohort is waiting for higher prices before ramping up their distribution pressure.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nDespite challenging and choppy market conditions, Long-Term Bitcoin Holders remain remarkably steadfast in their conviction, with evidence they are ramping up accumulation behaviour.\n\nAn elevated percentage of Bitcoin network wealth is held by this investor cohort relative to previous cycle ATH breaks, which suggests there is a degree of investor patience on display, and waiting for higher prices. Additionally, the lack of panic selling amongst this cohort in lieu of the largest price contraction of the cycle highlights a resilience of their aggregate conviction.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Bitcoin has been no exception, recording its largest drawdown of the cycle, causing capitulation amongst Short-Term Holders.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nAug 7, 2024 • 6 min read\nExecutive Summary\nA “correlation 1” event has seen major assets and equities decline markedly, with Bitcoin being no exception, recording its largest drawdown of the cycle.\nThe price contraction has resulted in the BTC spot price reaching the Active Investor Price, located at $51.4k, which is a crucial level for investor psychology.\nA dramatic flush out of leverage has also occurred, with futures open interest declining by 11% in one day. This likely increases the importance on on-chain data moving forwards.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nLive Webinar\n\nQ3 Guide to Crypto Markets\n\nRegister Here\nSelling-Off\n\nPeriods of widespread decline across global markets are typically infrequent, occurring at points of acute global stress, deleveraging, and heightened geopolitical risk. On Monday 5-Aug, equities and digital assets sold off sharply, as the unwinding of the yen-carry trade deleveraged markets, and US treasuries rallied on fears of a recession.\n\nBitcoin recorded a drawdown of -32% from the ATH, the most severe of the current cycle.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nTo assess the severity of the price contraction, we can utilize the well-known Mayer Multiple, which is the ratio between Price and the 200-day moving average. The 200DMA is widely considered a point of delineation between bullish and bearish market conditions by traders and investors.\n\nCurrently, the Mayer Multiple is trading at a value of 0.88, which is the lowest since the collapse of FTX in late 2022.\n\nLive Workbench\nKey On-Chain Pricing Levels\n\nMoving into the on-chain domain, we can assess the severity of the sell-off using the Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis, as well bands representing a -1 standard deviation move below. This helps us evaluate how the profitability of new investors has changed during volatile price action.\n\n🟠 Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis: $64,300\n🔵 Short-Term Holder Cost-Basis -1SD: $49,600\n\nThe Spot price crashed to within touching distance of the -1SD pricing band, with only 364 / 5139 (7.1%) trading days recording a deviation below the pricing level. This underscores the sharp pace of the market decline.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can also assess these market dynamics through the lens of Short-Term Holder MVRV, which gauges the magnitude of unrealized profit, or loss held across the new investor cohort.\n\nShort-Term Holders are currently holding the largest unrealized loss since the FTX implosion, which again highlights a point of serious investor stress imposed by current market conditions.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we evaluate the percentage of Short-Term Holder Supply held in profit, we can see that just 7% of their supply is held in a profitable position, and is similar to the sell-off in August 2023.\n\nThis is also more than -1 standard deviation below the long-term average for this metric, and suggests a notable degree of financial stress amongst recent buyers.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe True-Market Mean ($45.9k) and the Active Investor Price ($51.2k) both provide estimates of the average cost basis for investors who are active within the current cycle. These models attempt to discount lost and long dormant coins.\n\nThe position of the spot price relative to these two key pricing levels can be considered as zone of interest for differentiating between macro Bull and Bear markets.\n\n🔴 Active Investor Price: $51.2k\n🔵 True Market Mean: $45.9k\n\nThe market did find support near the Active Investor Price, which suggests a cohort of investors provides buy-side support near their longer-term cost basis. Should the market decisively break below these two pricing regions, if would require a significant re-evaluation of bull market structure, and would indicate a large proportion of the market is now underwater.\n\nLive Workbench\nRealized Losses Spike Higher\n\nIn the previous section, we evaluated the position of the market relative to levels where investors are likely to be under serious financial pressure. The next step is to assess the investor response, by analyzing the magnitude of losses locked in during the event.\n\nThe sell-off triggered a surge in panic by investors, with around $1.38B in realized losses locked in by market participants. In absolute terms, this is the 13th largest event in history on a USD denominated basis.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can decompose these losses by Long or Short-Term holder cohorts to identify which groups were most affected. Remarkably, 97% of all losses can be attributed to Short-Term Holders, and the Long-Term Holder cohort were comparatively unfazed.\n\nTherefore, we will focus on the Short-term Holder cohort as the centrepiece for loss analysis moving forwards.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nIsolating for Short-Term Holders, we note that the Z-Score of their Realized Loss has recorded a 6.85 standard deviation move, with only 32 trading days ever hitting larger value. This highlights the severity of the sell-off event in a historical context.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThis sentiment is echoed across the STH Realized Profit / Loss Ratio, which collapsed to historically low values, with only 6% of trading days recording a lower value.\n\nThis indicates that the primary reaction from investors was one of panic and fear, as coins were sold well below their original acquisition price.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nShort-Term Holder SOPR has also reached staggering depths, as new investors locked in a -10% loss on average. This speaks to a form of capitulation, with only 70 trading days ever registering a lower value.\n\nLive Chart\nDerivatives Flush Out\n\nIn derivatives markets, a large volume of long positions were forced closed, with a total of volume of $275m worth of long contracts liquidated. Additionally, an extra $90m was liquidated from the short-side, for combined total liquidation volume of $365m. This demonstrates how many leveraged speculators were purged from the market.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThis forced closure of positions resulted in a -3 standard deviation decline in futures open interest, equivalent to an -11% reduction in one day. This likely represents a complete reset across futures markets, and suggests that spot and on-chain data will provide key insight into the recovery process in the weeks ahead.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nAugust has already been a exceptionally eventful month across both equity and digital asset markets, after a “correlation-1” event sparked a major market sell-off. Bitcoin recorded its largest drawdown (-32%) from the ATH of the cycle, and precipitated a statistically significant capitulation amongst Short-Term Holders.\n\nFutures liquidations fuelled the fire, with over $365m worth of contracts forced closed, and creating a 3 standard deviation reduction in open interest. This has led to a meaningful flush out of leverage, and paves the way for on-chain and spot market data to be of key importance for analysts assessing the recovery in the weeks to come.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

This marks a historical event for the Bitcoin industry, and especially for the patient and resilient creditors who fought a long, hard battle to be reimbursed in BTC rather than fiat currency.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, this represents the final chapter in a major market overhang over the industry since 2013.\n\nThe total recovered coin volume was over 141,686 BTC, and just under 59k BTC has now been redistributed to creditors, with another 79.6k BTC soon to follow suit.\n\nLive Chart\n\nKraken and Bitstamp have been selected as designated exchanges responsible for redistributing creditor funds. Kraken has now received 49k BTC, and Bitstamp has received the first tranche of 10k BTC.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhen comparing the size of distribution over the last 2 months, from the Mt.Gox estate to other large entities, we can see that these distributions are already larger in scale than the ETF inflows, issuance to miners, and sell-side by the German Government.\n\nHowever, it is also worth noting the long history of creditors trying to recover their coins, as it can paint a picture of their likely behavior patterns moving forward:\n\nCreditors opted to receive BTC, rather than fiat, which was new in Japanese bankruptcy law.\nSeveral entities sought to acquire creditor claims throughout the decade-long legal process.\nGiven the extensive time-span between Mt.Gox collapsing, and today, it is likely many creditors (who didn’t sell their claims) remain somewhat active in the Bitcoin space.\n\nAs such, it is relatively likely that only a subset of these distributed coins will be truly sold onto the market. However, this idea rests on a degree of speculation, and the reality is difficult to measure individually.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe degree of sell-side pressure by the German Government in late June was tremendous, with over 48k BTC sold over the span of 1-month. Nevertheless, the market absorbed this supply and managed to rally from $53k to over $68k soon after.\n\nThe Bitcoin price has continued to trade between $68k and $66k throughout the Mt.Gox distribution, which may allude to a lighter than expected sell-side (thesis above), and/or a relatively resilient demand profile.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWith the knowledge that both Kraken and Bitstamp are the destination exchanges for redistributed coins, we can utilize the spot cumulative volume delta (CVD) metric to add more colour to this idea.\n\nCVD measures the net difference between spot buying and selling trade volumes on centralized exchanges (market orders only).\n\nIf we isolate the CVD metric related to Kraken, we can see a marginal uptick in sell-side pressure following the distribution. However, this remains well within typical day-to-day ranges.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFor Bitstamp, we can see a similar story, with only a marginal bias towards sell-side dominance.\n\nThis adds a bit more evidence to our thesis that creditors may be better thought of as having the mindset of long-term holders for the time being. If this thesis holds, it is a remarkable observation, as the incentive for creditors to take profits is very large due to the substantial price increase since 2013.\n\nLive Chart\nHODLing On\n\nBitcoin bull markets naturally attract sell-side pressure, as higher prices incentivize long-term holders to take profits on some of their holdings. We can observe this phenomenon through the significant decline in the Supply Last Active 1y+ and 2y+ metrics throughout March and April.\n\nThis describes long-term investors spending and selling coins to satisfy new demand in the run-up to the $73k ATH. The rate of decline across these curves has slowed of late, suggesting a gradual return to HODLing dominant investor behavior.\n\n🔴 Supply Last Active 1y+: 65.8%\n\n🟡 Supply Last Active 2y+: 54.9%\n\n🟢 Supply Last Active 3y+: 46.4%\n\n🔵 Supply Last Active 5y+: 31.3%\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe Realized Cap HODL Wave metric helps us segregate the USD wealth locked in coins held for less than three months. This allows us to evaluate the waves of in-flowing demand by new investors\n\nThe culmination of a euphoric bull market is often marked by a saturation in wealth held by these new buyers, which also represents a point of large-scale divestment by long-term holders.\n\nAt the moment, the proportion of wealth held by new investors is declining and well below the levels typically witnessed at macro market tops. This highlights a general shift in investor behaviour back towards HODLing, but also a general slow-down in new demand since the $73k ATH.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we inspect the cohort who have held their coins for 3- and 6-months, we can see a significant growth in their relative network wealth. This again suggests a general trend of investors active earlier in the year holding their coins dormant and maturing into increasingly senior age bands.\n\nFrom this, we deduce that HOLDing is likely the dominant mechanic within the Short-Term Holder cohort.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we flip and look at the opposite side of the equation, the long-term holders, we can investigate the behaviour of investors who acquired supply more than 6-months ago.\n\nLong-term investors currently hold 45% of the network wealth, which is relatively elevated compared to near macro cycle topping events. This underscores that long-term holders hold the coins in HODL mode and are arguably patiently waiting for higher prices to divest into market strength.\n\nLive Chart\n\nComparing the total balance held by both Long and Short-Term Holders, we note that a new divergence is underway. The supply of long-term holders is increasing, and the supply of short-term holders is declining.\n\nThe chart below shows that the approximate age boundary separating LTHs and STHs is for coins acquired before/after late Feb 2024, when the price was around $51k. Likely, many of the coins acquired during the height of the ETF-hyped run-up will soon start migrating into LTH status, and this divergence is likely to accelerate.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nFinally, we can utilize the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Binary Spending Indicator to profile and visualize the intensity of HODLer distribution pressure.\n\nThe distribution pressure by the LTH cohort remains relatively light and is declining. This provides further confluence behind our general thesis that the Bitcoin supply remains dominated mainly by longer-term, high-conviction investors. HODLing remains the preferred strategy for the time being.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nFinally, the long-awaited Mt.Gox distribution is occurring, a substantial victory for the creditors who fought tooth and nail for reimbursement in BTC and not fiat. Albeit, due to the rampant price increase across the decade, a non-trivial degree of sell-side pressure from the recipients can be assumed.\n\nNevertheless, the profile of the creditors appears to represent one of a HODLer or long-term investor, potentially dampening the magnitude of sell-side pressure across the coming weeks.\n\nAlongside this, the balance sheet of Long-Term Holders continues to grow, while their proportion of network wealth held remains substantially high compared to prior macro topping events. This suggests that the predominant market mechanic has transitioned to one of HODLing, as mature investors wait for higher prices to part with their coins.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nTesting The Range Bands\n\nBitcoin prices have rebounded strongly, rallying over $68k and catalyzing an uptick in perpetual futures activity. The appreciation in price has also provided much-needed relief for the Short-Term Holder cohort, with 75% of their coins now held in profit.\n\nCryptoVizArt, UkuriaOC, Glassnode\nJul 24, 2024 • 6 min read\nExecutive Summary:\nBinance, Bybit and OKX remain the industry leaders for perpetual swap markets, accounting for around 84% of the total open interest.\nWe introduce a novel model to track the sensitivity of leverage and Open Interest in Futures markets relative to changes in the spot Bitcoin price.\nPrice has climbed back above the Short-Term Holder cost basis, which has provided much-needed relief for new investors, with over 75% of their supply moving back into profit.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nPerpetual Pivots\n\nThe perpetual futures markets are the deepest and most liquid trading venue for digital assets. The trade volume is often orders of magnitude greater than spot markets, and it is a preferred instrument for executing trades, speculative positions, and arbitrage strategies.\n\nIn this section, we aim to introduce a framework which utilizes the perpetual futures market to identify market pivot points. It seeks to identify points where over-leveraged speculators are liquidated during a bull market correction.\n\nIn 2024, open interest across perpetual futures has ranged between 220k and 240k BTC. This value often decreases quickly during deleveraging events and increases during more speculative periods. More recently, open interest has risen into the 260k to 280k BTC range, indicating an elevated appetite for speculation since early June.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo better understand the mechanics of the perpetual markets, we have measured the share of the top three exchanges by open interest.\n\nAs shown below, Binance, Bybit and OKX comprise around 84% of the market share, and will therefore, focus on metrics related to these exchanges for our analysis.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nA pivot point in the perpetual market usually involves a considerable reduction in open interest, often a direct result of margin call liquidations of traders holding highly leveraged positions.\n\nThe chart below highlights periods where open Interest of the top three exchanges dropped more than 5% over a weekly period. Over the last 12 months, we have encountered ten of these perpetual futures flush-out events.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nTo assess the size of contracts forcefully closed, we measure the total liquidation volume during these deleveraging events. The chart below shows that the overall liquidation volume (both long and short) surged above the typical bull market baseline of $200M/day. This demonstrates the role of margin call liquidations in the open interest decline noted in the chart above.\n\nLive Workbench\nDirectional Bias\n\nDuring market turmoil, deleveraging events can occur when the market moves in either direction. However, in this instance, we are exclusively isolating for potential pivot points during the bull market corrections and have therefore segregated the liquidations into two subsets:\n\n🟢 Long-Dominant Liquidations where more than 50% of liquidated positions were on the long side of the contract\n🔴 Short-Dominant Liquidations where more than 50% of liquidated positions were on the short side of the contract\n\nDuring the recent sell-off to $55k, we can see an ideal long liquidation candidate pivot point was recorded. Here, over-leveraged long positions were liquidated, which led to a sharp decline in open interest across the top three perpetual futures exchanges.\n\nLive Chart\n\nNext, we can establish a framework to spot these pivot points using the perpetual funding rate. This approach utilizes the 7-day moving average of funding rates across the top three exchanges.\n\nThis is an extremely insightful metric which provides information on the directional bias of positions within perpetual markets. When the weekly average of the funding rate is above the neutral level (0.01% per 8 hours), it suggests there is a large demand from market takers to open a long position.\n\nAfter setting the current ATH at $73k in March 2024, there has been waning demand for long positions across perpetual markets. Alongside this, the second attempt at rallying above $73k in May saw sentiment briefly switch to positive. However, the overall sentiment regime has remained neutral to negative since then.\n\nThe latest rally from the $54k region has been a great example of over-leveraged long positions being liquidated near the local lows. Funding rates residing below the 0.01% neutral level suggest that there has not been a rush for new long positions to open since the July low was established.\n\nLive Chart\nShort-Term Profitability Improves\n\nThe recent price surge has also been a welcome relief for Bitcoin Short-Term Holders (STHs), a proxy for new demand and recent buyers. This cohort saw over 90% of their supply fall into a loss in late July, putting them into a financially stressful position.\n\nThis rally has now broken back above the STH cost basis and returned 75% of their held supply to an unrealized profit. This can be seen within the STH-MVRV metric, which has now recovered above the break-even level of 1.0.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can increase the granularity of this assessment by inspecting the individual age breakdowns of the Short-Term Holder MVRV metric. We can use this lens to see how profitability has changed across sub-groups of recent buyers. The ages we analyze range from very recent buyers (1-day to 1-week), right through to those on the brink of transitioning into Long-term Holder status (3 to 6-months).\n\n🔴 1d-1w MVRV: 1.05\n🟠 1w-1m MVRV: 1.1\n🔵 1m-3m MVRV: 1.0\n🟣 3m-6m MVRV: 1.07\n\nAt present, all constituents of the Short-Term Holder cohort have returned to positive profitability, which highlights the strength of the prevailing uptrend. This is likely to be positive for overall investor sentiment.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nFinally, we can evaluate the net realized profit/loss for each sub-cohort, which can be considered a measure of net capital flows. This metric also shows signs of constructive improvement, with most age constituents experiencing a positive capital flow, with the only exception being bar the 1m-3m cohort.\n\nThis 1m-3m cohort has carried the brunt of the recent range-bound and downside price action and is also one of the larger age bands in this study.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nPerpetual futures markets are the most liquid and deep instruments within the digital asset markets, making them a valuable market information source. As BTC prices traded down into the $53k region, it resulted in a meaningful deleveraging event, as many long-biased traders were liquidated near the lows.\n\nThe recovery price bounce has also been very strong, returning a majority of Short-Term Holders to an unrealized profit. This has provided much-needed financial relief and is supported by a period of net positive capital inflows over recent weeks.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nSurviving the Sell-Off\n\nThe Bitcoin market recently absorbed over 48k BTC in sell-side sourced from the German Government. With Mt Gox distributions also on the horizon, we examine these major sell-side forces, as well as the role ETFs have on price action.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nJul 16, 2024 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nLarge labelled entities currently hold approximately 4.9M BTC, which is equivalent to 25% of the circulating supply. Amongst these entities, centralized exchanges and ETF custodians account for the largest portion.\nFollowing the complete exhaustion of BTC sell-side by the German Government, there appears to be near-term sell-side relief, as well as renewed inflows of demand to support the market.\nMarket profitability remains remarkably robust, with the majority of the coin supply still held at a favourable cost basis, and below the current spot price.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nAssessing Large Entities\n\nThe landscape of Bitcoin holders remains a constantly evolving space, which requires an evolution of analysis frameworks over time. Historically, miners and exchanges have been the largest and most dominant Bitcoin holders.\n\nThrough history, large coin holdings have ended up custodied by market agnostic entities, such as the Mt.Gox trustee, tasked with holding the coins recovered after the collapse and bankruptcy of the Mt.Gox exchange. Similarly, significant coin volumes have been seized by government law enforcement, which are periodically sold off in tranches.\n\nMore recently, institutional grade custodians, and ETFs have entered the picture. The suite of 11 new US spot ETFs have now accrued a combined +887K BTC, making their combined balance the second largest pool of Bitcoin that we monitor.\n\nThe chart below shows the volume of BTC held by these large entities.\n\n🟨 Centralized Exchanges: 3M BTC\n⬜ US ETF Balance: 887k BTC\n🟦 Miners excluding Patoshi: 705k BTC\n🟩 Government Entities: 207k BTC\n🟥 Mt Gox Trustee: 139k BTC\nLive Workbench\n\nMiners have historically been a primary source of sell-side pressure, however their supply relevance does decrease with each halving event. Miner netflows over the last 12-months shows a typical aggregate balance change of around ±500 BTC per week.\n\nIn the chart below, we compare miner net flows 🔵 to the net deposit / withdrawal volumes of centralized exchanges 🟠, and to the netflows into ETF on-chain wallets 🟢. We can see that the latter two entities often see much larger swings of ±4K BTC, suggesting flows through these entities are likely to have a market influence of around 4x to 8x larger than for miners.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nKeeping this netflow dynamic as our baseline, we can gauge the intensity of estimated sell-side pressure by large sized entities, by isolating only net outflow volumes. From this, three key observations can be made:\n\nElevated sell-side pressure from miners tends to occur around periods of price volatility.\nETF outflows dominated following the market setting a new ATH in March, which was largely dominated by the GBTC product.\nSell-side sourced from the German Government in the last few weeks has been tremendous. However, we can also see that the majority of outflows occurred after prices had sold off to $54k, suggesting the market effectively front-ran the news.\nLive Workbench\n\nThe chart below shows the cumulative net outflow activity of these large entities since the $73k ATH. From this, we can see how sell-side pressure from Miners is comparatively small relative to Government sell-side, ETF outflows, and exchange deposit volumes.\n\nCentralized exchange deposits continue to be the largest and most persistent source of sell-side pressure. However even with these primary trading venues as our upper bound, we can see the massive scale of sell-side from the German Government of late.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nIncreasing our focus on the German Government sell pressure, we can see their 48.8k BTC balance was depleted over just a few weeks. The majority was distributed over a very short window between 7-July and the 10th-July, where over 39.8k BTC flowed out of labelled wallets.\n\nInterestingly, this sell-side occurred after the market had bottomed around $54k, suggesting market front-ran the news.\n\nLive Chart\nStability and Speculation\n\nFollowing an extended period of choppy range-bound trading, aggregated netflows across all ETFs saw a sustained period of outflows. As prices sold off towards the $54k low, they dropped below the average inflow cost basis of ETF holders, which is currently at $58.2k.\n\nIn response, the ETFs have seen their first significant tranche of positive interest since early June, with over $1B in total inflows last week alone.\n\nLive Chart\n\nVolumes deposited and withdrawn from exchanges tend to be a strong gauge for investor interest and market liquidity. After the ATH was set in March, there has been a marked decline in exchange flows, where BTC volumes 🟠 have since found a stable baseline of around $1.5B/day.\n\nIf we compare the inflow and outflow structure for Ethereum 🔵, there has been a notably less interest relative to the 2021 bull cycle. At the height of the 2021 bull cycle, daily ETH exchange flows were almost as large as for BTC.\n\nThis suggests that the degree of speculative interest in 2024 has been comparatively muted, and aligns with the generally weaker performance of ETH relative to BTC since the 2022 cycle lows.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe magnitude of realized profit and loss being locked in by investors can also provide a proxy for demand. By this metric, we can see a similar story, where significant demand supported the rally into the ATH, and was followed by a period of compression and consolidation.\n\nThis underscores the an equilibrium being established between supply and demand over the past 3-months. We can also see that realized losses have not ticked meaningfully higher thus far, suggesting limited panic, despite the market correcting over -25% from the highs.\n\nLive Workbench\nNet Sell-Side\n\nIf we consider exchange inflows of BTC and ETH as sell-side pressure, we can compare this to the inflow volumes of stablecoin, representing a proxy for demand. By this metric, we are able to assess the overall balance between buy-side or sell-side bias in the market.\n\nWe can consider this via the following framework:\n\nValues near zero suggest an neutral regime, where buy-side inflows are of an equivalent magnitude to sell-side pressure from the major two assets.\n🟢 Positive values suggest a net buy-side regime, where stablecoin buy side exceeds sell-side by the major assets.\n🔴 Negative values suggest a net sell-side regime, where sell-side volumes exceed the available new stablecoin capital to absorb it.\n\nAs we can see, the market has been experiencing a net sell-side regime since mid-2023, however this has been on the decline over the last few months.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe see a similar dynamic using the spot cumulative volume delta (CVD) metric. This tool measures the net difference between buying and selling trade volumes on centralized exchanges.\n\nFrom this perspective, we can see the significant sell-side dominance since the March ATH. However, as of last week, CVD has recorded the first net-buy-side indicator since July, suggesting a softening of sell-side pressure applied to spot markets.\n\nLive Chart\nInvestor Profitability Remains Robust\n\nAs Bitcoin prices traded down to the local low of $53.5k, the proportion of the coin supply held at an unrealized loss spiked to around 25% of the coin supply. This brought the Percent Supply in Profit metric back down towards its long-term mean of 75%, which is a level it has historically visited during previous bull market corrections.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nBy segregating the percent of the coin supply in profit by Long and Short-Term Holders, we can evaluate the impact of the price contraction on these two cohorts.\n\nAcross the last 30-days, the Short-Term Holder (STH) cohort experienced a dramatic decline in profitability, with more than -66% of their supply moving into an unrealized loss. This is one of the largest declines in STH profitability on record.\n\nThis suggests that a significant number of “top buyers; have seen their portfolio profitability challenged in recent weeks.\n\nHowever, for the opposing cohort, the Long-Term Holders, they have experienced a negligible shift in the proportion of their supply held in profit. This demonstrates that relatively few investors from the heights of the 2021 bull still hold onto their coins.\n\nOverall, this indicates that the STH cohort remain the primary group who are most likely to respond to market volatility, with their average cost basis is currently at around 64.3k.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nExamining the magnitude of major sell-side forces, Miners have historically been a primary source of sell-side pressure, however, we note a diminishing return on their market impact with each successive halving. Alternatively, the relevance of ETF Flows and Centralized Exchanges on price action grows convincingly.\n\nThe Bitcoin market absorbed a significant 48k BTC across the last month as the German Government achieved a full distribution of their balance sheet. This complete exhaustion of the German Government sell-side pressure has provided the market with ample relief, whilst initial glimmers of a renewed demand-side have stimulated positive price action.\n\nShort-Term Holders have endured a challenging month with the recent correction placing a substantial portion of their coin supply into a position of loss. Alternatively, mature investors remained steadfast, experiencing a near negligible decline in profitability, highlighting their impressive conviction and robust market positioning.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nBulls Under Pressure\n\nFollowing several months of sideways price action, Bitcoin has experienced its deepest correction since late 2022, trading below the 200DMA, and putting a significant number of Short-Term Holders into an unrealized loss.\n\nCryptoVizArt, UkuriaOC, Glassnode\nJul 9, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary:\nBitcoin has recorded its deepest drawdown for the current cycle, trading more than -26% below the ATH. Despite this, the drawdown remains historically shallow relative to past cycles.\nThis price contraction has put a significant volume of Short-Term Holder Supply into an unrealized loss, with over 2.8M BTC now underwater based on their on-chain acquisition price.\nWhilst financial pressure is elevated amongst Short-Term Holders, the magnitude of losses locked in has remained relatively subdued in comparison to the market size.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nPrice Performance\n\nThe 2023-24 Bitcoin cycle has been both similar and different to previous cycles. The market experienced around 18 months of steady price appreciation after the collapse of FTX, followed by three months of range-bound price action after the $73k ETF high. Between May and July, the market experienced its deepest cycle correction, recording a drawdown exceeding -26% from the ATH.\n\nWhilst this is meaningful, this downtrend has been notably shallower than previous cycles, highlighting a relatively robust underlying market structure and compression of volatility as Bitcoin matures as an asset class.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nIf we assess price performance relative to each cycle low, the 2023-24 market has behaved eerily similar to the last two cycles (2018-21 and 2015-17). The reason for Bitcoin following such a similar path is a regular topic of debate, but it continues to provide a valuable framework for analysts to think about cycle structure and duration.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nHowever, if we look at performance indexed to the date of the Bitcoin halving, we can see that the current cycle is one of the worst performing. This is despite the market breaching to a new cyclical ATH prior to the halving event in April, which was the first time this has happened.\n\n🔴 Epoch 2: +117%\n🔵 Epoch 3: -7%\n🟢 Epoch 4: +30%\n⚫ Epoch 5: -13%\nLive Workbench\n\nOn a daily basis, we can evaluate the number of daily drawdowns during an uptrend which exceed the 1 Standard Deviation threshold to the downside. This helps us assess the number of meaningful sell-off events that investors experienced throughout the bull market uptrend.\n\n2011-13: 19 Events\n2015-18: 27 Events\n2018-21: 26 Events\nCurrent Cycle 2023-24: 6 Events (to date)\n\nThe current cycle has recorded 6 daily drawdowns more than 1 standard deviation below the long term mean. This would suggest that the current cycle has either been notably shorter and less volatile than previous cycles, or perhaps there is more fuel in the investor tank.\n\nLive Workbench\nNew Investors Underwater\n\nAssessing the volume of supply held by Short-Term Holders, we can see substantial growth from January 2024 onward. This accompanied explosive upwards price action in response to the spot ETFs going live, and reflected a strong inflow of new demand.\n\nHowever, this demand profile has reached a plateau in growth over recent months, suggesting an equilibrium had formed between supply and demand in Q2-2024. This has since given way to a supply overhang, as fewer Long-Term Holders take profits, and fewer new buyers step in to accumulate.\n\nLive Chart\n\nDuring sustained bull markets, local bottoms are commonly established after the volume of Short-Term Holder supply held in loss saturates around 1M to 2M BTC. In more severe cases, this supply in loss can peak to between 2M and 3M BTC.\n\nWe can see an example of this during the recent sell-off down to the 53k price level, which pushed the volume of coins held below their cost basis to over 2.8M BTC. This is the second time this has occurred in the last 12-months, with August 2023 being the other example where over 2M BTC owned by new investors were held in an unrealized loss.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can assess he intensity of these periods by counting the number days where more than 2M Short-Term Holder coins were underwater for at least a 90 day period. By this metric, this indicator has actively flagged for 20 days so far.\n\nIf we make a comparison with the market conditions seen in Q2-Q3 2021, a much more significant Short-Term Holders experienced a much more significant duration of 70 consecutive days in acute financial stress. That period of time was severe enough to break investor sentiment, and gave way to the destructive 2022 bear market. By comparison, this cycle has been relatively forging for the time being.\n\nLive Workbench\nA Halt On Profitability\n\nWith a contraction in spot prices underway, the ratio between investor Realized Profit and Realized Loss has declined in tandem. This indicator has now declined into the 0.50 to 0.75 range, which is a more neutral level seen during bull markets corrections.\n\nWe can also see a similar pattern of sharp fluctuations in this metric throughout the 2019 to 2022 cycle, which could be considered a reflection of inherent instability and investor uncertainty.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nZooming into Short-Term Holder losses specifically, we can see a total realized loss of ~ $595m was locked in by this cohort this week. This is the largest loss taking event since the 2022 cycle low.\n\nFurthermore, only 52 out of 5655 trading days (< 1%) have recorded a larger daily loss value, highlighting the severity of this correction in dollar terms.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nHowever, when we denominate these same Short-Term Holder losses as a percentage of total invested wealth (divided by the STH Realized Cap), we can see a dramatically different picture. On a relative basis, the losses locked in by this cohort remain fairly typical compared to previous bull market corrections.\n\nIn the chart below, we have highlighted (blue) periods of time where the both percent of Short-Term Supply held in Loss, and the magnitude of losses locked have moved more than 1 standard deviation from the mean.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nLooking at losses locked in by both Long-Term, and Short-Term Holders, we note that the loss taking events this week account for less than 36% of the total capital flows across the Bitcoin network.\n\nMajor capitulation events, such as Sep 2019, March 2020, and the sell-off in May 2021, saw losses account for more than 60% of capital flows over a period of several weeks, with a meaningful contribution from both cohorts.\n\nTherefore, it could be argued that there are more similarities between the prevailing market contraction, and the Q1-2021 topping formation, more so than severe capitulation events. Nevertheless, the onus still falls towards the demand side to arrest the negative price momentum, else the profitability of investors will continue to deteriorate.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nFollowing 18 months of up-only price action after the FTX implosion, and 3 months of apathetic sideways trading, the market has endured its deepest correction of the cycle. Nevertheless, drawdowns across our current cycle remains favourable when compared to historical cycles suggesting a relatively robust underlying market structure.\n\nThe aggressive contraction has plunged a significant amount of Short-Term Holders into a position of severe unrealized loss, placing a large degree of pressure upon the cohort. However, the magnitude of losses locked in has remained relatively subdued in comparison to the market size. Alongside this, the lack of Long-Term Holder participation in loss taking suggests mature investors remain profitable, despite the ensuing market hysteria.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

A multitude of volatility measures are also heavily compressed, suggesting a larger move is on the horizon.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nJul 3, 2024 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nDespite Bitcoin prices trading sideways to down, a significant proportion of the market remains in profit, with Short-Term Holders carrying the majority of losses.\nUsing a combination of on-chain pricing models and technical indicators, we define and explore the a set of potential scenarios for the market moving forwards.\nVolatility continues to be historically compressed, which suggests a degree of both investor apathy, but also suggests an under-indexing for heightened volatility ahead.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nMarket Profitability Remains Robust\n\nAs BTC prices sold off down into the $60k region, a degree of fear and bearish sentiment could be discerned amongst many digital asset investors. This is not uncommon when market volatility stagnates and goes to sleep, as apathy creeps in.\n\nNevertheless, from the lens of MVRV Ratio, aggregate investor profitability remains remarkably robust, with the average coin still holding a 2x profit multiple. This is a level that often delineates the 'Enthusiastic' and the 'Euphoric' bull market phases.\n\nLive Chart\n\nMoving one layer deeper, we can segregate all coins held either in a position of unrealized profit or loss. This allows us to evaluate the average cost basis of each group, as well as the average magnitude of unrealized profit and loss held per coin.\n\n🔴 The average coin in profit is holding an unrealized gain of +$41.3k, with a cost basis of approximately $19.4k. Of note, this figure will be partially skewed by coins last moved in earlier cycles, including the Patoshi entity, early miners, and lost coins.\n🔵 The average coin in loss is holding an unrealized loss of -$5.3k, and has a cost basis of approximately $66.1k. These coins are primarily held by Short-Term Holders, since very few 'top buyers' from the 2021 cycle still hold on today.\n\nBoth of these metrics can help identify points of potential sell-pressure, as investors seek to hold onto their gains, and/or avoid holding onto even heavier unrealized losses.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nIf we look at the ratio between the unrealized profit/loss per coin, we can see that the magnitude of paper gains held is 8.2x larger than paper losses. Only 18% of trading days have recorded a larger relative value, all of which are within Euphoric bull market regimes.\n\nIt could be argued that the March ATH set following the approval of the ETFs had several characteristics which are coincident with historical bull market peaks.\n\nLive Workbench\nGrounding Expectations Using Confluence\n\nBitcoin prices have been consolidating within a well defined $60k to $70k range since the March ATH, and a degree of investor apathy and boredom has taken hold. This has led to widespread indecision, and a market which has failed to establish a robust trend in either direction.\n\nTo ground our position in the cycle, we shall consult a simplified framework for thinking about historical Bitcoin market cycles:\n\n🔴 Deep Bear Market: Prices trades below the Realized Price.\n🔵 Early Bull Market: Prices trade between Realized Price and True Market Mean.\n🟠 Enthusiastic Bull Market: Prices trade between the ATH and True Market Mean.\n🟢 Euphoric Bull Market: Prices trade above the previous cycles ATH.\n\nAt the moment, prices remains within the Enthusiastic bull regime, after a few very brief excursions into the Euphoric zone. The True Market Mean resides at a value of $50k, which represents the average cost basis per active investor.\n\nThis level remains a key pricing levels for the market to remain above if the macro bull market is expected to continue.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nNext we will look towards the Short-Term Holder cohort, and overlay their cost basis with levels denoting +-1 standard deviations from it. This provides insight into areas where these price sensitive holders may start to react:\n\n🔴 Significant unrealized profit signals a potentially overheated market, which is currently at a value of $92k.\n🟠 The break-even level of the STH cohort is at $64k, which the spot price is currently below, but making an attempt to reclaim.\n🔵 Significant unrealized loss signals a potentially oversold market, which is currently at at a value of $50k. This aligns with True Market Mean as a bull market break-point.\n\nOf note, only 7% of trading days have recorded spot prices trading below the -1SD band, making it a relatively uncommon occurrence.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWith price trading below the STH cost basis, it is judicious to inspect the degree of financial stress within various subsets of this cohort. Using our breakdown by age metrics, we can dissect and inspect the cost-basis of differing age constituents within the Short-Term Holder cohort.\n\nCurrently, coins aged 1d-1w, 1w-1m and 1m-3m are all holding an unrealized loss on average. This shows that this consolidation range has been largely unproductive for traders and investors.\n\nThe 3m-6m cohort remains the only sub-group to remain in an unrealized profit, with an average cost-basis of $58k. This aligns with the price low of this correction, which again marks this as a key area of interest.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nMoving towards technical indicators. we can use the widely used Mayer Multiple metric, which assesses the ratio between price and its 200DMA. The 200DMA is often used as a simple indicator for assessing bullish or bearish momentum, making any breaks above or below a key market pivot point.\n\nThe 200DMA currently resides at a value of $58k, once again providing confluence with on–chain price models.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can use the URPD metric to further assess concentrations of supply around particular cost basis clusters. Currently, the spot price is near the lower bound of a large supply node between $60k and the ATH. This aligns with the cost basis models of Short-Term Holders.\n\nWith 2.63M BTC (13.4% of the circulating supply) located within the $60k to $70k cluster, small price fluctuations are able to substantially affect the profitability of coins and investor portfolios.\n\nOverall, this indicates a risk that many investors may be sensitive to any price drops below $60k.\n\nLive Chart\nVolatility Expectations\n\nAfter several months of range-bound price action, we note a marked decline in volatility across many rolling window time frames. To visualise this phenomena, we introduce a simple tool to detect periods of realized volatility contraction, which often provides an indicator that heightened volatility is likely ahead.\n\nThe model assesses the 30d change in Realized Volatility across 1-week, 2-week, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 1-year timeframes. When all windows are exhibiting negative 30d change, a signal is triggered, inferring that volatility is compressing, and so are investor expectations of lower volatility ahead.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can also assess market volatility by measuring the percent range between the highest and lowest price ticks over the last 60-days. By this metric, volatility continues to compress to levels rarely seen, but usually after lengthy consolidations, and prior to large market moves.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nFinally, we can bolster our volatility assessment using the Sell-Side Risk Ratio. This tool assesses the absolute sum of realised profit and loss locked in by investors, relative to the size of the asset (the Realized Cap). We can consider this metric under the following framework:\n\nHigh values indicate that investors are spending coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium, and usually follows a high volatility price move.\nLow values indicate that the majority of coins are being spent relatively close to their break even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‘profit and loss’ within the current price range, and usually describes a low volatility environment.\n\nNotably, the STH Sell-Side Risk has contracted to historic lows, with only 274 out of 5083 trading days (5%) recording a lower value. This suggests that a degree of equilibrium has been established during this price consolidation, and alludes to heightened volatility expectations in the near future.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nThe Bitcoin market is in an interesting place, with apathy and boredom dominating, despite prices being 20% below the ATH. The average coin is still holding a 2x unrealized profit. however newer buyers are disproportionately underwater on their positions.\n\nWe also explored key pricing levels where investor behavior patterns may shift. We sought a degree of confluence across both on-chain and technical indicators, and derived three key areas of interest.\n\nA break below $58k to $60k would put a significant number of STHs into loss, and trade below the 200DMA price level.\nPrice action between $60k and $64k continues the current sideways trajectory of market indecision.\nA decisive break above $64k would put a meaningful volume of STH coins back into profit, with a likely uptick in investor sentiment.\n\nVolatility continues to compress across multiple time-frames, both from a pricing, and an on-chain perspective. Metrics like the Sell-Side Risk Ratio, and 60-day price range have fallen towards historic lows. This suggests that the current trading range is in the later stages of developing towards the next range expansion.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nSizing Up Diamond Hands\n\nAs Bitcoin struggles to reclaim the recent ATH, we investigate the Long and Short-Term cohorts contribution to the supply and demand side. We also leverage the new breakdown metrics to evaluate the spending behavior and market influence of differing subsets of Long-Term investors.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Checkmate, UkuriaOC, Glassnode\nJun 25, 2024 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe market has effectively traded sideways since the $73k all-time-high which was set in March. By our estimates, demand momentum has turned negative since early May.\nWe analyse the cost-basis of short-term investors as a method to inspect capital flows into the market.\nTo analyze the supply side, we refer to long-term holders, and identify that the unrealized profit held by this cohort is statistically far from historical peaks.\nLooking at the spending behaviour of long-term holders, it can be seen that although the spent volume by these players constitutes only 4%-8% of the total volume, the profits realized from this spending typically account for 30%-40% of cumulative profits realized over bull markets. This finding underlines the concentration of wealth in older coins gradually paying back the diamond hands over the bull market.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nTracking Demand\n\nIn WoC 18, we explored a methodology to identify the direction and intensity of capital flows in or out of the market. We consider a framework utilizing the average cost-basis of various age brackets within the short-term holder cohort:\n\nWhen the cost basis of these cohorts is in an uptrend, it suggests capital flows into the market as new buyers acquire coins at higher prices (and vice versa for downtrends).\nAs spot prices deviate above or below the cost basis, we can approximate the degree of unrealized profit held by each group via the MVRV Ratio.\nWe can consider MVRV values to be a gauge on the incentive for investors to take profits (high values), or an indicator of seller exhaustion (low values).\n\nWe will start by comparing the spot price in relation to the cost basis of two cohorts:\n\n🟠 Holders with 1-week to 1-month old coins.\n🔴 Holders with 1 to 3-month old coins.\n\nFrom this, we can identify when macro tides change in capital flows during the early stages of the bull and bear phases. The chart below presents how these two price models have provided market support during the 2023-24 bull.\n\nSince mid-June, the spot price has plunged below the cost basis of both the 1w-1m holders 🟠($68.5k) and 1m-3m holders 🔴 ($66.4k). If this structure persists, it has historically resulted in a deterioration of investor confidence, and risks this correction being deeper and taking longer to recover from.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can also characterise market momentum by comparing the cost basis of these cohorts to each other. The chart below highlights:\n\nCapital Inflows 🟦 when the cost basis of the 1w-1m holders trades above the 1m-3m cost basis. This underscores a positive momentum in demand, and, attracting new capital into the market\nCapital Outflows 🟪 when the cost basis of the 1w-1m holders plunges below the 1m-3m cost basis. This structure signals a diminishing momentum in the demand side, and a net capital outflow from the asset.\n\nDuring previous bull markets, a negative capital flow structure has occurred up to five times. We can also see that this structure has been in play since May and into early June.\n\nLive Workbench\nNavigating the Supply Side\n\nTo achieve a complete macro view of the current market, we can leverage metrics which describe the behavior of Long-term holders (LTHs). The LTH cohort is the primary actor on the supply side during bull markets as they distribute coins and take profits. Market cycle tops are established, in part, when LTHs ramp up their selling intensity until it overwhelms and exhausts demand.\n\nThe following chart compares the spot price against significant multiples applied to the average cost basis of the LTH cohort (LTH Realized Price).\n\n1.0 * LTH Realized Price 🟢 historically aligns with the bottom formation phase of the bear cycle and into the market recovery.\n1.5 * LTH Realized Price 🟠 delineates the recovery phase from a longer-term equilibrium phase of the bull. Price tends to experience a slower rate of growth, and on average, LTHs are holding an unrealized profit is around +50%.\n3.5 * LTH Realized Price 🔴 provides a distinguishing boundary between the equilibrium phase, and the euphoria phases of the bull market. This is a point where price tends to appreciate quickly, and LTHs tend to increase their distribution pressure due to being at an unrealized profit of 250% or more.\n\nIf we apply this framework to recent cycles, we can see that the ongoing bull has been very similar to the 2017 cycle from a macro perspective. In particular, the recent consolidation phase near the previous ATH aligns with the equilibrium to euphoria boundary described by the 3.5 multiple applied to the LTH-Realized Price 🔴.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe magnitude of unrealized profit held by LTHs can be considered as a measurement of the incentive for this group to spend coins, and take chips off the table. We can visualise this psychological incentive using the LTH-NUPL metric.\n\nAt the time of writing, LTH-NUPL is at 0.66, which resides between levels associated with the pre-euphoria phase 🟢. This condition has been in play for 96-days, which is a very similar duration to the 2016-17 cycle.\n\nLive Chart\n\nUsing the Long-Term Holder Spending Binary Indicator, we can identify periods where strong spending by this cohort is underway. During these events, the aggregate balance held by LTHs declines consistently, and significantly.\n\nFrom this, we can identify the following LTH-spending regimes:\n\nWeak Spending 🟩 where LTH supply declines for at least 3 of the last 15-days.\nModerate Spending 🟧 where LTH supply declines for at least 8 of the last 15-days.\nStrong Spending 🟥 where LTH supply declines for more than 12 of the last 15-days.\nLive Workbench\n\nThe next chart has been designed to combine both of the previous models to assess LTH sentiment and behavior. This combines the incentive for this cohort to take profits with their actual spending behaviour.\n\nWe consider four regimes describing shifts in LTH divestment and behavior patterns:\n\nCapitulation 🟥 where spot price is lower than the LTH cost basis, and therefore any strong spending is likely associated with fear and capitulation.\nTransition 🟧 where price trades slightly above the LTH cost basis, and with occasional light spending. This is considered to be associated with typical day-to-day activity.\nEquilibrium 🟨 after recovering from a prolonged bear, where the market seeks a new balance between a light inflow of new demand, lighter liquidity, and a gradual divestment by underwater holders from the previous cycle. Strong LTH spending during this stage is usually associated with sudden rallies or corrections.\nEuphoria 🟩 as LTH-MVRV trades above 3.5, and is historically aligned with the market hitting the prior cycle ATH. The LTH cohort holds upwards of +250% in unrealized profits on average. The market enters a euphoric rise, which motivates these investors to spend at very high and accelerating rates.\n\nUsing this stencil, we can see an elevated spending regime by LTHs throughout Q4 2023 and into 2024 Q1. This puts the market into the equilibrium regime over this period.\n\nLive Workbench\nDissecting the Spending By Strong Hands\n\nThe previous metric considers periods when the aggregate Long-Term Holder supply declines. Similarly, the Short-Term Holder cohort, we can also inspect which sub-age-groups are responsible for the sell-side pressure.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo assess the contribution of each sub-group of LTH spending, we have highlighted the days when their spending volume is at least one standard deviation above the yearly average.\n\nWhilst there are occasional bursts of spending activity for each cohort, the frequency of high-spending days increases dramatically during the euphoria phase of a bull market. This highlights the relatively consistent behaviour pattern of long-term investors taking profits during periods of rapid price appreciation.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nGiven only 4%-8% of daily on-chain volume corresponds to LTHs, we can leverage another core on-chain metric to explain the relative weight of these investors on the supply side.\n\nLive Chart\n\nDespite their small share of spent volume, LTH coins are typically moving at significantly higher (or lower) prices than when they were initially acquired. Therefore, the magnitude of the realized profit or loss via spent coins provides a valuable lens into their behavior patterns.\n\nThe chart below captures the cumulative volume of realized profit locked in by long-term holders during bull markets. What we find is that LTHs typically account for between 20% and 40% of the total profit locked in over time.\n\nDespite their volume being just 4% to 8% of the daily total, the LTH cohort accounts for up to 40% of the profit taking by investors.\n\nLive Workbench\nConclusion\n\nWith sideways price action dominating since early March, we leveraged the cost-basis of both long and short-term investors to assess the current degree of supply and demand in the market.\n\nUtilizing the change in Short-Term investors' sub-cohorts’ cost basis, we constructed a toolbox that estimates the momentum of capital flow into the network. The results confirmed that the ATH in March was followed by an interval of capital outflow (negative momentum).\n\nFollowing on, we dissected the Long-Term Holder spending into different age sub-cohorts. The conclusion indicated that the frequency of high-spending days increases dramatically during the euphoria phase of a bull market. Interestingly, the Long-Term Holders volume accounts for a only marginal 4% to 8% of the daily total, however, the cohort represents a substantial 40% of the profit taken by investors.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

However, volumes across all market facets are declining markedly as an equilibrium between demand and sell-side forces is established.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nJun 18, 2024 • 6 min read\nExecutive Summary\nDespite chaotic price action, investor profitability remains robust, with the average coin holding an unrealized profit of around 120%.\nThe demand side has been sufficient to absorb sell-side pressure and HODLer divestment but insufficient to promote further upward growth.\nThe cash-and-carry trade continues, with a particular uptick by institutional traders, reinforcing an expectation of range-bound trading for the time being.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nMarket Profitability Remains Robust\n\nSideways price movement tends to manifest as investor boredom and apathy, which appears to be the dominant response across all Bitcoin markets. BTC prices are consolidating within a well-established trade range. Investors remain in a generally favourable position, with over 87% of the circulating supply held in profit, with a cost basis below the spot price.\n\nLive Chart\n\nEmploying the MVRV metric, we can assess the magnitude of unrealized profit the average investor is holding.\n\nCurrently, the average coin holds an unrealized profit of around +120%, typical of previous markets trading around the previous cycle ATH. The MVRV Ratio remains above its yearly baseline, suggesting that the macro uptrend remains intact.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can use the MVRV Ratio to define pricing bands which assess points of extreme deviations in investor profitability relative to the long-term mean. Historically, breakouts above 1 standard deviation have aligned with longer-term macro topping formations.\n\nCurrently, the BTC price is stabilizing and consolidating between the 0.5 and 1 standard deviation range. This again highlights the statistically high profit the average investor is holding despite the recent choppy market conditions.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWhen the market decisively punched above the 2021 ATH, significant investor distribution occurred, driven largely by the Long-Term Holder cohort. This reflected a substantial profit being made, which acts to increase the actively traded and liquid supply.\n\nTypically, in the immediate aftermath of a new ATH, the market needs ample time to consolidate and digest the introduced supply overhang. As an equilibrium is established, this leads to a decline in both realized profits and sell-side pressure.\n\nThis reduction in sell-side pressure and profit-taking naturally reduces overhead market resistance. Nevertheless, the BTC price has been unable to sustain a palpable upward rally since the March ATH. This demonstrates that while the demand side is stable enough to keep the market range bound, it is ultimately not increasing sufficiently to reestablish upward momentum.\n\nLive Workbench\nLackluster Volume\n\nDespite healthy investor profitability, the magnitude of volume being processed and transferred on the Bitcoin Network following the ATH has declined drastically. This underscores a reduced appetite for speculation and heightened indecision in the market.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA similar story can be observed when assessing the Spot Volume traded across major centralized exchanges. This demonstrates the strong correlation between onchain network settlement volumes and trade volumes, echoing a sentiment of boredom amongst investors.\n\nLive Chart\nExchange Activity Tumbles\n\nMoving one level deeper, we can inspect the onchain inflows to exchanges in a BTC denomination, we note once more a considerable reduction in activity.\n\nAt present, Short-Term Holders are sending around +17.4k BTC/day to exchanges. However, this is markedly lower than the peak of +55k BTC/day recorded as the market hit the $73k ATH in March, where speculation levels were becoming excessive. Conversely, Long-Term Holder distribution into exchanges is relatively low, with only a marginal 1k+ BTC/day in inflows currently.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can visualize the stark decline in LTH investor activity via the percentage of Long-term Holder balances sent to exchanges.\n\nLTHs are sending less than 0.006% of their total holdings into exchanges, suggesting that this cohort has reached equilibrium and that higher or lower prices are required to stimulate further action.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nMore coins are currently being transferred in a position of profit (+11k BTC) than in loss (+8.2k BTC). This suggests that a profit driven bias remains overall, albeit by a relatively small margin.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nCurrently, the average coin sent to Exchanges is realizing a profit of around +$5.5k and a -$735 haircut, respectively, for coins sent in the loss. This puts the average profit at 7.5x larger than losses, and only 14.5% of trading days have recorded a higher value in this ratio.\n\nThis infers that HODLers are still divesting, and demand is sufficient to absorb the sell-side pressure but not large enough to push market prices higher. This suggests that the market structure is more beneficial for range traders and arbitrage strategies rather than directional and trend trading strategies.\n\nLive Workbench\nCash and Carry Basis Trades\n\nAnother tool that enables us to characterize spot markets is the Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD). This metric describes the net bias in market taker buy vs sell volume, measured in USD.\n\nAt the moment, a net sell-side bias dominates the spot market, however, the market continues to trend sideways. This confluences the aforementioned idea that the demand-side is approximately equivalent to the sell-side pressure, keeping the market range bound.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAssessing the futures market, we note a sustained elevation in open interest, currently over $30B, and just shy of its previous ATH. However, as highlighted in WoC-24, a substantial portion of this open interest is related to the market-neutral cash-and-carry basis trade.\n\nIn a range-bound market, increases in open interest can signify an uptick of volatility capture strategies as traders collect the premium available in the perpetual swap, futures, and options markets.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe considerable growth of open interest at the CME Group exchange highlights a growing presence of institutional investors. The CME Group exchange currently hosts over $10B in OI, representing just under a third of the global market share.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn contrast to the rising open interest, futures trade volumes have experienced a similar decline to spot markets and onchain transfer volumes. This suggests a relatively light appetite for speculation, and a higher dominance from set-and-forget basis trade and arbitrage positions.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nDespite the choppy and sideways market conditions the average Bitcoin investor has remained largely profitable. However, investor decisiveness has declined as signified by contracting volumes across spot, and derivatives market, and also in on-chain settlement.\n\nAn equilibrium in both the demand and sell-side appears to be established, resulting in relatively stable prices, and a notable lack in volatility. This stagnation in market movement translates into a degree of boredom, apathy, and indecision by investors. Historically, this suggests that a decisive price movement in either direction is necessary to stimulate the next round of market activity.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nDissecting Divergences\n\nDespite impressive US ETF inflows, a market-neutral Cash-and-Carry trade appears to be subduing buy-side pressure, requiring non-arbitrage demand to further stimulate price action. Alongside this, we explore the divergence between declining active addresses and surging transaction counts.\n\nCryptoVizArt, UkuriaOC, Glassnode\nJun 11, 2024 • 6 min read\nExecutive Summary\nIn the advent of the Runes protocol, a counterintuitive divergence has formed between declining active addresses and increasing transaction counts.\nMajor labelled entities now hold a staggering ~4.23M BTC, accounting for over 27% of the adjusted supply, with US Spot ETFs now commanding a balance of 862k BTC.\nThe Cash-and-Carry trade structure appears to be a meaningful source of ETF inflow demand, with the ETFs being utilized as the instrument for obtaining the long spot exposure, whilst an increasingly large net short position for Bitcoin accrues in the CME Group futures market.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-Chain Dashboard.\nA Divergence in Activity\n\nOnchain activity metrics like active addresses, transactions, and volumes provide a valuable toolkit to analyse the growth and performance of blockchain networks. When China imposed restrictions on Bitcoin mining in mid-2021, the number of Active Addresses on the Bitcoin network experienced an aggressive decline, plunging from over ~1.1M/day to just ~800k/day.\n\nThe Bitcoin network is currently experiencing similar contraction in network activity, albeit, with entirely different drivers. In the following sections, we shall explore how the advent of Inscriptions, Ordinals, BRC-20s, and Runes have significantly altered how on-chain analysts should perceive activity metrics moving forwards.\n\nLive Workbench \n\nDespite the historical confluence between strong market momentum, and an expansion of active addresses and transaction counts per day, a deviation in this trend is underway.\n\nWhilst active addressees appear to be collapsing, the amount of transactions processed by the network has seen is near new all-time-highs. The present monthly average transaction count resides at 617k/day, which is 31% above the yearly average, and signifies a relatively high demand for Bitcoin blockspace.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nIf we compare the recent decline of active addresses with the share of transactions attributed to inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens, we can observe a strong correlation. Of note, Inscription counts have also fallen off a cliff since mid April.\n\nThis suggests that the initial driver of the decline in address activity is largely due to reduction in inscription and ordinals usage. It is important to note that many wallets and protocols within this sector reuse addresses, which are not double counted if the address is active more than once in a daily period. As such, if a single address generates ten transactions in a day, it would appear as one active address, but ten transactions.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo illustrate how the inscriptions sector has grown since early 2023, we can see how the cumulative total inscription count has expanded. The number of inscriptions has reached 71M at the time of writing, however, since mid-April this year, the popularity of the protocol has declined markedly.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo explain the decline in inscription activity, we must highlight the emergence of the Runes protocol, which claims to be a more efficient method to introduce fungible tokens on Bitcoin. Runes went live on the halving block, which explains the inscription drop off in in mid-April.\n\nRunes follow a different mechanism to Inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens, by utilziing the OP_RETURN field (80 bytes). This allows the protocol to encode arbitrary data to the chain whilst requiring significantly less blockspace.\n\nWith the Runes Protocol launching at the time of halving (20 April 2024), the demand for runes transactions skyrocketed to between 600k and 800k per day, and has remained elevated since.\n\nImage Metric\n\nRunes-related transactions have now largely displaced BRC-20 tokens, as well as Ordinals and Inscriptions, commanding an impressive 57.2% of daily transactions. This indicates that collector speculation has likely shifted from Inscriptions to the Runes market.\n\nImage Metric\nA Divergence in ETF Demand\n\nAnother recent divergence which has garnered attention is the stagnant, sideways movement of price despite the impressive inflows into the US Spot ETFs. To ground and assess the ETF demand-side, we can compare the ETF balance (862k BTC) to other major labelled entities.\n\nUS Spot ETF = 862k BTC\nMt. Gox Trustee = 141k BTC\nUS Government = 207k BTC\nAll Exchanges = 2.3M BTC\nMiners (Exc. Patoshi) = 706k BTC\n\nThe aggregated balance of all these entities is estimated to be ~4.23M, which accounts for 27% of the overall adjusted circulating supply (which is the total supply minus coins that have remained dormant for more than seven years).\n\nLive Workbench\n\nCoinbase as an entity holds a vast fraction of both aggregate exchange balances, as well the US Spot ETF balances via its custody service. The Coinbase Exchange and Coinbase Custody entities currently hold an estimated 270k and 569k BTC respectively.\n\nImage Metric\n\nWith Coinbase serving both ETF clients and conventional on-chain asset holders, the gravity of the exchange in the market pricing process has become significant. Evaluating the number of Whale Deposits to Coinbase exchange wallets, we can see a considerable increase in deposit transactions following the launch of the ETFs.\n\nHowever, we note a significant portion of the deposits are associated with the outflows from the GBTC address cluster, which has been a long-standing supply overhead throughout the year.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nIn addition to GBTC selling pressure as the market rallied to new ATHs, another factor has recently contributed to the dampening of US Spot ETF demand pressure.\n\nLooking at the CME Group futures market, open Interest has stabilized above $8B, after setting a new record high of $11.5B in March 2024. This may signal that an increasing number of traders from traditional markets are adopting a cash-and-carry-arbitrage strategy.\n\nThis arbitrage involves a market-neutral position, coupling the purchase of a long spot position, and the sale (short) of a position in a futures contract of the same underlying asset which is trading at a premium.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can see that entities categorised as hedge funds are building up an increasingly large net short position for Bitcoin.\n\nThis provides confluence that the cash-and-carry trade structure may be a meaningful source of ETF inflow demand, where the ETFs are the instrument for obtaining the long spot exposure. The CME Group exchange has also seen a dramatic increase in both open interest, and overall market dominance since 2023, suggesting it is becoming a preferred venue for hedge funds to shorting futures via the CME Group exchange.\n\nAt present, Hedge Funds are net short in both CME Bitcoin and Micro CME Bitcoin markets by $6.33B and $97M, respectively.\n\nCME COTs - THE BLOCK\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe drastic divergence between activity metrics has been accelerated by the extreme popularity of the Runes protocol, which utilizes significant address reuse where singular addresses are generating multiple transactions.\n\nThe emergence and magnitude of the Cash-and-Carry trade between long US Spot ETF products and shorting futures via the CME Group exchange has largely neutered the buy-side inflows into ETFs. This has resulted in a relatively neutral impact on market prices, suggesting organic buy-side from non-arbitrage demand is required to further stimulate positive price action.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

The market responded to a false alarm regarding the distribution of Mt.Gox supply, however this offers a lens into how we can consider these events using onchain data.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nJun 4, 2024 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe majority of Bitcoin investors are holding unrealized profits, and the first signs of speculation appetite is returning to the market after two months of sideways trading.\nThe Short-Term Holder cohort are shouldering the vast majority of market losses, a condition typically observed during bull market corrections from new ATHs.\nBoth Long and Short-Term Holders have experienced a reset in their Sell-Side Risk ratio, suggesting a new equilibrium has been found. This indicates that the market is ready to move, and volatility expectations for the near future should be heightened.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-Chain Dashboard.\nMt Gox on the Move\n\nOn 28-May-2024, the market reacted to an internal wallet consolidation by the Mt.Gox Trustee, the legal entity who custodies the 141k BTC from the failed exchange. After more than a decade, this is the first indication that the long awaited Mt.Gox distribution event is on the horizon.\n\nMark Karpeles, the former CEO of Mt.Gox, confirmed that the nature of the coin movement was due to internal wallet management in preparation for distribution back to creditors. Distributions are expected to be completed by October this year.\n\nAs far as I know everything is fine with MtGox. The trustee is moving coins to a different wallet in preparation of the distribution that will likely happen this year, there is no imminent sale of bitcoins happening.\n\n— Mark Karpelès (@MagicalTux) May 28, 2024\n\nEvaluating the Mt.Gox balance, we can visualize this event leveraging Glassnodes Point-in-Time (PiT) metrics. PiT metrics are immutable, and reflect the state of each metric using all known wallet clusters at the time of observation. The standard MtGox Balance metric is mutable, and reflects the best estimate across all points in time. This demonstrates the learning behaviour and clustering of Glassnode metrics as it tracks entity wallets.\n\nHere we can see the internal wallet management, where over 141k BTC were moved over several tranches throughout the day of 28-May.\n\nLive Workbench\nCapital Flows and Composition\n\nA major impact of such a large pool of long-dormant coins being spent is that unfiltered metrics like Realized Cap, SOPR, and Coindays destroyed will show a large spike associated with these Mt Gox coins. Theoretically, these coins have been revalued to a higher cost-basis during the wallet management transactions.\n\nWe can utilize our entity-adjusted variant of the Realized Cap to filter out these non-economical transfers, to maintain a clear picture of capital flows into Bitcoin. The Realized Cap currently resides at an ATH valuation of $580B. However, we can see that the rate of new liquidity inflows has slowed down since late April as the market consolidated.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Realized Cap HODL Waves metric can then be used to inspect the composition of this aggregate wealth by age. By isolating coins younger than 3-months old, we are able to evaluate the proportion of liquidity held by ‘new demand’.\n\nThis cohort currently accounts for a non-trivial 41% of network wealth, providing evidence that a wealth distribution towards new demand is occurring. With respect to historical terminal values across cycles, this wealth transfer often reaches 70%+ saturation by new demand, suggesting that a comparatively smaller volume of supply has been spent and sold by longer-term investors.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhilst both inflowing liquidity and appetite for speculation have slowed down over the last 2 months, the reclamation of the $68k level has driven a majority of the Short-Term Holder cohort back into holding an unrealized profit.\n\nThis indicates that despite recent sideways choppy price action, the majority of recent buyers now have a cost basis which is more favourable and below the current spot price.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can study the average acquisition prices across various age band constituents, and another group of interest are the Single-Cycle holders (coins aged 6m-3y). We note that all components of this group have been holding a significant magnitude of unrealized profit since prices broke above the $40k region.\n\nThe market absorbed a large magnitude of distribution from this cohort as price rallied into the $73k ATH. We can expect that this cohorts incentive to sell more supply will grow should prices climb high, and elevate their unrealised profit further.\n\nLive Workbench\nA Long-Term Holders Market\n\nWith the market consolidating just shy of its ATH, we can employing the URPD metric to visualize the BTC supply by the cost basis at which it was acquired.\n\nThere is a significant cluster of Short-Term Holder coins which have been accumulated in close proximity to the current spot price. This suggests significant investment has taken place within this price region. This however introduces a risk of increased investor sensitivity to any volatile price fluctuations in either direction.\n\nAlmost all coins held in an unrealized loss are in the Short-Term Holder cohort, which makes sense given the proximity to the prior cycles ATH.\n\nLive in Glassnode Engine Room\n\nThe chart below is a tool describing the proportion of the Short-Term Holder supply which is held in loss. This tool can be used to observe when this cohort experiences heightened sensitivity to changes in price action, particularly when a large volume of supply falls into loss over a short time period.\n\nThe market recently pulled back to $58k, reflecting a -21% correction, and the largest contraction since the collapse of FTX. At the lows of this move, a staggering 56% (1.9M BTC) of the STH supply moved into a position of loss.\n\nHowever, whilst a large volume of supply was technically underwater, the magnitude of unrealised loss remained in line with typical bull market corrections, and is beginning to abate as the market stabilizes.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nTurning to Long-Term Holders, we can see that the total volume of LTH Supply held in loss is negligible, with only 4.9k BTC (0.03% of LTH Supply) acquired above the spot price. Given new ATHs were only set in March (less than 155-days ago), these LTH coins in loss are the small few holders who bought the 2021 cycle top, and have held ever since.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nAnother way to visualise this is via the proportion of all supply held in loss, which falls into the LTH cohort. At the bottom of bear markets, LTHs tend to carry the majority of unrealized losses, as speculators are flushed from the market, and the final capitulation results in a major transfer of coin ownership towards high conviction holders.\n\nConversely, during the euphoric phase of the Bull Market, the LTH contribution to the supply held in loss tends towards zero. In parallel, the STHs shoulder the vast majority of market losses, as new demand buys coins near the local and global price peaks.\n\nAt the moment, the LTHs hold a marginal 0.3% of the supply in loss, whilst subsequently accounting for over 85% of the supply in profit.\n\nLive Workbench\nRoom for Growth\n\nWe can investigate the activity of our Long and Short-Term holder cohorts via analysis of their spending behaviors. For this, we can utilize the Sell-Side Risk Ratio which assesses the absolute value of profit plus loss locked in by investors, in relation to the size of the asset (measured as the Realized Cap). We can consider this metric under the following framework:\n\nHigh values indicate that investors are spending coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium, and usually follows a high volatility price move.\nLow values indicate that the majority of coins are being spent relatively close to their break even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‘profit and loss’ within the current price range, and usually describes a low volatility environment.\n\nNotably, a reset in both profit and loss taking has occurred across the STH cohort, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been established during the recent sideways price consolidation.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nFor the Long-Term Holder cohort, their Sell-Side Risk ratio increased significantly as profits were taken leading up to and through the $73k ATH.\n\nHowever, in a historical context, their Sell-Side Risk ratio remains at a lower level compared to prior ATH breaks. This implies that the relative magnitude of profit taken by the LTH cohort is small relative to previous market cycles. This may suggest that this cohort is waiting for higher prices before ramping up their distribution pressure.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nThe first glimmers of market speculation appear to be returning after a a multi-month price consolidation. Both new buyers, and single-cycle investors are primarily holding unrealized profits. This observation is bolstered by the fact that only 0.03% of the Long-Term Holders are in a position of loss, which is typical of the early euphoric phase of a bull market.\n\nOver the last 2-months, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio for both Long and Short-Term Holders has reset and returned to an equilibrium. This suggests that a majority of profit and loss which was likely to be taken in this price range, has been, and hints to an increased risk of substantial volatility in the near future.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Calm Bull\n\nResiding just shy of the ATH, Bitcoin continues to consolidate, with long-term investors beginning to re-accumulate coins for the first time since Dec 2023. Alongside this, a historic first tranche of Ethereum spot ETFs have been approved in the US, seeing a +20% surge in the ETH price.\n\nCryptoVizArt, UkuriaOC, Glassnode\nMay 28, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary:\nBoth Ethereum and Bitcoin markets are showing relative strength after a lengthy post-ATH consolidation, although prices have remained choppy and sideways since March.\nThe SEC has surprised the market with the approval of the Ethereum Spot ETFs, resulting in a +20% rally in the ETH price.\nBitcoin US Spot ETFs netflows have once again turned positive after four weeks of net outflows, suggesting a return of TradFi demand.\nLong-Term Holder spending pressure has cooled off significantly, with investors back to accumulation patterns, suggesting volatility is required to motivate the next wave.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nA Coiling Spring\n\nAfter recording the deepest correction on a closing basis since the FTX lows (-20.3%), Bitcoin has recovered back towards the ATH, reaching $71k on 20-May. From a comparative point of view, the drawdowns pattern across the 2023-24 uptrend appears to be remarkably similar to the 2015-17 bull market.\n\nThe 2015-17 uptrend occurred during Bitcoin’s infancy when no derivative instruments were available for the asset class. The parallel we can draw to the current market structure suggests that the 2023-24 uptrend may be a largely spot-driven market. This view is supported by the launch and inflows into the US Spot ETFs.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nEthereum has also seen notably shallower corrections since the FTX lows compared to prior cycles. This structure infers a degree of increasing market resilience is developing between each successive pullback, alongside a reduction in downside volatility.\n\nHowever, it is worth highlighting that Ethereum has experienced a slower recovery relative to Bitcoin. ETH has also notably under-performed compared to other leading crypto assets over the last 2 years, manifesting in a weaker ETH/BTC ratio.\n\nNevertheless, the approval of US Spot ETFs this week came as a widely unexpected development and may provide the necessary catalyst to stimulate strength in the ETH/BTC ratio.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nIf we examine the rolling performance of the Bitcoin market across weekly 🟥, monthly 🟦 and quarterly 🟧 timeframes, we can see generally strong performance, recording values of +3.3%, +7.4%, and +25.6%, respectively.\n\nTo highlight periods of particularly strong price performance, we can count the number of trading days within a 90d window where performance across all three timeframes exceeds +20%. Only 5 days through the last quarter have reached this threshold so far.\n\nIn prior cycles, this count reached between 18 and 26-days, which suggests the current market may be somewhat more measured relative to historical bull markets.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can assess Ethereum under a similar framework and can see the dramatic impact of the ETF approvals. The news motivated almost instantaneous buy-side pressure, with all three timeframes printing their first >20% price movement since late 2021.\n\nIf we consider the sizeable impact and influence that spot ETFs have had on Bitcoin since the turn of the year, the ETH/BTC trading pair may be exhibiting early signs of a more promising road ahead.\n\nLive Workbench\nETF Buyer Comeback\n\nThe Bitcoin price decisively broke to a new ATH of $73k in early March, at the same time as long-term holders were divesting a significant volume of supply. This sell-side created an overhang of supply, leading to a period of correction and consolidation. Over time, lower prices and seller exhaustion started to give way to a regime of re-accumulation.\n\nWe can see this playing out in the Bitcoin ETF flows which transitioned into a regime of net outflows throughout the month of April. As the market sold off to the local low around $57.5k, the ETFs saw a large net outflow of -$148M/day. However, this turned out to be a form of micro-capitulation, and the trend has reversed sharply since.\n\nLast week, the ETFs experienced a remarkable net inflow of $242M/day, suggesting a return back into buy-side demand. Considering the natural daily sell pressure by miners since the halving of $32M/Day, this ETFs buy pressure is almost 8 times larger. This highlights the size and scale of the ETF impact, but also the relatively small influence of the halving moving forwards.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nBack to Euphoria\n\nThe percentage of the circulating supply in profit provides valuable information over each market cycle, and a set of repeating patterns has emerged. During the early stages of a bull market, as price attempts to reclaim the prior ATH, the percent of supply in profit breaks above its statistical threshold of ~90%. This signals the start of the Pre-Euphoria phase, and it historically entices investors to take profit from the table.\n\nThis sell-side pressure is usually attributed to long-term holders, who seize the opportunity to exit the market at elevated prices, especially after shouldering the downside volatility throughout the previous bear market.\n\nAs the market breaks towards a new ATH and price discovery, it enters the Euphoria phase, where the supply in profit starts to fluctuate around the 90% level for the next 6-12 months. The current euphoria phase is relatively young but has been active for around 2.5 months, with 93.4% of supply held in profit at the time of writing.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nAnother tool we can use to monitor corrections is the magnitude of unrealized losses held by investors. Given unrealised losses near ATHs represent 'local top buyers', we can evaluate the proportion of the supply which falls into loss 90d rolling window. This seeks to assess the percentage of coins which have lost their “in-profit” status compared to the local price peak.\n\nMechanically, these deep declines occur as new capital enters the network, absorbing sell-side pressure distributed during a local uptrend, which subsequently falls into loss during the following correction.\n\nThe depth of these drawdowns throughout the current uptrend is also comparatively similar to the 2015-2017 bull market, again suggesting a relatively robust market. This indicates that despite local peaks being set, they do not appear to have an excessive volume of coins bought at too high of a price.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nDiamond Hands in Charge\n\nAs prices appreciate in response to renewed buy-side pressure, the importance of the opposing side, the sell-side pressure, from Long-Term Holders grows in tandem. Therefore, we can evaluate the unrealized profit of the LTH cohort as a measure of their incentive to sell, and their realized profit to assess actual sell-side.\n\nFirst, the MVRV Ratio for LTHs reflects their average unrealized profit multiple. Historically, the transition phase between a bear and a bull market sees LTH trade above 1.5, but below 3.5 🟧, and can last for one to two years.\n\nIf the market uptrend remains sustainable, forming new ATHs in the process, the unrealized profit held by LTHs will expand. This will substantially elevate their incentive to sell, and eventually leads to a degree of sell-side pressure that gradually exhausts the demand side.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nTo close out this assessment, we will evaluate the spending rate of LTHs by via the 30-day net position change in their supply. During the run-up to the March ATH, the market experienced its first major tranche of LTH distribution.\n\nDuring the last two bull markets, the LTH net distribution rate reached a substantial 836k to 971k BTC/month. At present, the net sell pressure peaked at 519k BTC/month in late March, with approximately 20% of this originating from Grayscale ETF holders.\n\nThis high-spending regime was followed by a cooling-off period, with a local regime of accumulation that saw aggregate LTH supply grow by around +12k BTC/Month.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nIn the wake of significant long-term holder investor distribution into the $73k ATH, sell-side pressure has noticeably contracted. The Long-Term Holders have since started to re-accumulate coins for the first time since December 2023. Alongside this, the spot Bitcoin ETFs have also seen a clear resurgence in demand, experiencing positive inflows, reflecting a substantial volume of buy-side pressure.\n\nFurthermore, a levelling of the playing field between Bitcoin and Ethereum has occurred, with the approval of US Spot ETFs for Ethereum by the SEC. This further solidifies the ever-growing adoption of digital assets throughout the traditional financial system, and is a major step forward for the industry.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Macro Reset\n\nBitcoin markets have experienced a cool down after several months of intense distribution pressure. Whilst capital inflows remain modest, the lightening of sell-side, and compression of volatility suggest a bigger move could be on the horizon.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nMay 21, 2024 • 6 min read\nExecutive Summary\nFollowing a significant period of distribution into the ATH, a period of cooling down and consolidation has been underway, and sell-side pressure is winding back markedly.\nAlongside lighter sell-side activity, capital inflows remain relatively modest, although remain in a profit dominated regime and have been sufficient to stimulate local price action.\nVarious measures of volatility have compressed over the course of this correction, which usually precede a larger scale market move, since equilibrium has been reached on-chain.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nSupply Side Slows\n\nStrong Bitcoin markets naturally attract sell-side pressure, as higher prices motivate long-term holders to distribute some portion of their holdings. We can see this via the large decline in the Supply Last Active 1y and 2y throughout March and April, as longer-term investor cohorts distributed coins to satisfy new demand in the run up to the ATH.\n\nHowever, the supply held by the 3y+ cohort continues to increase, suggesting this cohort are generally waiting for higher prices before parting ways with their coins. As of the time of writing, more than half of the Bitcoin coin supply hasn’t transacted onchain in the last 2yrs or more.\n\n🔴 Supply Last Active 1y+: 65.8%\n\n🟡 Supply Last Active 2y+: 54.9%\n\n🟢 Supply Last Active 3y+: 46.4%\n\n🔵 Supply Last Active 5y+: 31.3%\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe Long-Term Holder (LTH) Binary Spending Indicator is another tool we can use to profile and visualize the intensity of HODLer distribution pressure. We note a significant and sustained decline in LTH Supply into the $73k ATH in March.\n\nAs of the last few weeks however, this distribution pressure has eased off markedly, giving the bulls more breathing room, and less resistance overall.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe flip side to a decrease in LTH Supply is, a sharp increase in supply held by Short-Term Holders (STHs), who represent new investors who have recently acquired coins.\n\nA local divergence is starting to develop between LTH and STH Supply, which adds weight to the case that there is a cooling off of distribution pressure across mature investors.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe Liveliness metric also captures this change in market character, and indicates that the Bitcoin network is seeing a greater volume of coinday creation than destruction. In other words, the market is now expressing a greater preference for holding coins for longer periods of time, rather than actively distributing coins for a profit.\n\nLive Chart\nDemand Side Remains Modest\n\nThe Realized Cap is a metric unique to on-chain analytics, measuring the cumulative USD liquidity ‘stored’ within the asset class. It currently and resides at a value of $574B.\n\nCurrently, the rate at which new capital is flowing into the Bitcoin network has slowed down considerably from its peak as the market digests the recently distributed supply.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe rate at which the Realized Cap changes each day can therefore be used as a gauge for capital inflows. The recent injection of liquidity in the run up to the ATH was extremely sharp, culminating at a value of $3.38B/day. This surpassed the peak of the 2021 bull market, and has cooled off noticeably since.\n\nCurrently, this metric remains in positive profit dominated territory, and is returning towards an equilibrium position. However, with declining sell-side headwinds from mature investors, this wave of modest demand has been enough to stimulate price action.\n\nLive Chart\nVolatility Compression\n\nWith a lightening up of supply-side pressure, but also of capital inflows, it becomes prudent to turn towards our volatility tools to ground our expectations for the next move.\n\nFor this, we can employ the Sell-Side Risk metric, which evaluates the total value locked in by coins spent on-chain (Realized Profit + Realized Loss) in relation to the size of the asset class (Realized Cap).\n\nHigh values indicate that investors are spending coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis. This condition indicates that the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium, and usually follows a high volatility price move.\nLow values indicate that the majority of coins are being spent relatively close to their break even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached. This condition often signifies an exhaustion of ‘profit and loss’ within the current price range, and usually describes a low volatility environment.\n\nWe can see a large decline in the Sell-Side Risk Ratio over recent weeks, which suggests the market has found a degree of equilibrium over the course of this correction.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can also assess market volatility by measuring the percent range between the highest and lowest price ticks over the last 60-days. By this metric, volatility continues to compress to levels typically seen after lengthy consolidations, and prior to large market moves.\n\nLive Workbench\nTracking Top Heaviness\n\nTo close out, we can leverage the URPD metric to assess the density of coins with a cost basis around the current spot price. We use this concept to identify points of market sensitivity, where a market move could motivate a response from a large base of investors.\n\nWith price moving to the end of the distribution, we note that a substantial ~15.9% of the coin supply is held just below the current spot price, potentially providing a robust cluster of support.\n\nContrary to the dense cluster of coins below, only 1.1% of the circulating supply remains above our current spot price, suggesting a sustained inflow of demand could catalyze a period of price disovery.\n\nLive Chart\n\nSTH supply is currently at 3.36M BTC, and during the recent correction, over 2.14M BTC fell into an unrealized loss (63.2%). However, as the market rallies back above $70k, this has decreased to just 230k BTC, which is approximately 6.8% of the total.\n\nThis suggests that despite the heavy concentration of coins near the current spot price, there are relatively few of them not held at an unrealized loss, which considerably reduces the risk of top heaviness developing.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nFollowing an intense period of mature investor distribution into the $73K ATH, sell-side pressure has markedly declined. This has led to a reduction in headwinds and overhead resistance, with even only modest demand able to stimulate positive price action.\n\nAlongside this, volatility continues to compress across longer timeframes, whilst a dense cluster of supply has formed below our current spot price, potentially providing a robust foundation to build upon.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nIdentifying Seller Exhaustion Across Multiple Timeframes\n\nUsing our new Breakdown Metrics, we are now able to discretely isolate points of severe unrealized loss, and investor capitulation. In this article, we introduce a new framework to assess seller exhaustion across multiple timeframes and investor cohorts.\n\nUkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nMay 14, 2024 • 6 min read\nExecutive Summary:\nDuring a Bull Market regime, long-term investors are generally highly profitable. Therefore, the dominant source of realized loss originates from the Short-Term Holder cohort, which can provide information on inflection points during sell-off events.\nGiven that market inflection points unfold from the inside-out, we produce a framework using our newly released Breakdown by Age metrics to profile seller exhaustion across day trader and weekly-monthly investor cohorts.\nWithin this framework, we utilize onchain metrics to assess both the unrealized and realized losses of the targeted investor classes as a gauge for their response to market downturns.\nEstablishing a Seller Exhaustion Framework\n\nWhen evaluating a Bitcoin bull market over a macro timeframe, price action can be broadly characterised by elevated volatility to the upside, with corrections and consolidations along the way. All investors are aware that financial markets do not move upwards only over time, and which creates the sort of cat-and-mouse game between supply and demand which creates local and global correction events.\n\nWe will start by assessing the Realized Loss for both Long and Short-Term Holders. We can observe that losses taken by LTHs 🔵 almost exclusively occur around macro cycle downturns. Conversely, losses are locked in by recent buyers throughout all phases of the market, and are typically the dominant source of loss during bull market.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn this report, we will take advantage of the fact that the Short-Term Holder cohort is the dominant group locking in losses, and use this to identify periods of seller exhaustion. The goal is to identify inflection points during corrections and consolidations within a dominant bull trend.\n\nHere, we define Seller Exhaustion as a point of oversold conditions, where a majority of the sellers who are likely to sell, and done so. Since every seller is matched with a buyer, we can simultaneously gauge periods when this sell-side is absorbed by an influx of buy-side demand, which helps establish a local bottom.\n\nInflection points in market trends tend to reverberate upwards from smaller timeframes (minutes to hours) through to larger timeframes (days to months). In order to capture this effect, we will utilize our newly released age breakdown metrics to isolate two distinct sets of investors from within the STH cohort:\n\nDaily Traders [24hr Cohort]\nWeekly-Monthly Swing Traders [1d-1m Cohort]\n\nIn order to model points of extreme financial pressure and reaction, we call upon three profit/loss metrics which help us establish the severity of the pressure investors are experiencing.\n\nMVRV Ratio which assesses the unrealized profit or loss held by investors within the cohort.\nSOPR which evaluates the average magnitude of profit or loss locked in by the cohort.\nRealized Loss which isolates the USD denominated magnitude loss locked in by the cohort.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nDaily Traders\n\nInitially, we start with an assessment of the Daily Trader group, and utilize the 24hr age breakdown.\n\nThis is inherently the fastest moving cohort, and the most sensitive to the spot price, reacting near instantaneously to any and all fluctuations in price action. Thus, this cohort will produce a large amount of seller exhaustion signals, but with a larger proportion of noise due to the erratic nature of the selected timeframe.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nFirst, we evaluate the MVRV Z-Score (with a 90 data point look-back period) for the Day Trader cohort. We can see this metric consistently flips from high to low values as a result of the intraday volatility of price, which then impacts the unrealized profit/loss held by this cohort.\n\nSince we are looking for seller exhaustion signals during a correction, we isolate points when the MVRV Z-Score trades more than -1σ below the mean. These are points of heightened unrealized loss, and points of statistically significant pressure placed upon Day Traders.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nNext, we shall incorporate the SOPR metric to assess whether the unrealized financial pressure was acted upon, and whether those losses were crystallized, or not. Again, we isolate for Z-Score values more than -1σ below the mean, which identifies periods of micro-capitulation, and large sell-side pressure.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nFinally, we can bolster the above observations by assessing the USD denominated realized loss locked in by the Day Trader cohort. Here, we are evaluating the absolute magnitude of the sell-side pressure. Keeping consistency, and applying a similar Z-Score framework to 24hr realized losses, we are able to confirm periods of micro-capitulation, indicated when values are 2σ above the mean.\n\nLive Workbench\nWeekly-Monthly Traders\n\nMoving onto the Weekly-Monthly traders, we first observe that the oscillation within the signal has slowed noticeably. This is the expected result as we expand up to longer term age bands, which smooths out the average cost basis. This cohort is less price sensitive than the Day Trader group, however they are also more likely to experience volatility as the spot price fluctuates around their cost basis during their holding time.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nInvestigating the 1d-1m MVRV Z-Scores, we can see that this variant is less responsive to price action compared to the 24hr variant. As a result, this MVRV variant is slower to move, generates fewer signals overall, but also has less noise overall.\n\nThe chart below highlights when the MVRV Z-Score trades below the mean (negative Z-Score values), as an indicator that significant unrealized losses have transferred up to the larger 1d-1m age band.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nAgain, we use the SOPR Ratio Z-Score to confirm whether these investors are under sufficient pressure to capitulate and lock in those losses. Similar to the MVRV Ratio Z-Score, we isolate points when the Z-Score trades below the mean. This provides a degree of confluence that realized losses are starting to reverberate from smaller to larger timeframes.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nLastly, we can establish one final layer of confluence using the with the Realized Loss Z-Score. In this instance, we distinguish for Z-Score values trading +2σ above the mean to confirm a significant USD denominated loss has been locked in by the Weekly-Monthly swing trader cohort.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nOn-chain data provides analysts and investors with a remarkable degree of transparency into the positioning, incentives, and actions of various market participants. We can use these tools to build models and tools for assessing how investor behavior changes in response to price action.\n\nUtilizing our newly released breakdown metrics, we are able to isolate individual subsets of investors using the heuristic of age bands, as a proxy for their holding time. We then use confluence across three onchain metrics describing the profitability of these investor groups to identify points of micro-capitulation, which tend to accompany local market lows.\n\nThis framework helps us think about what incentives and actions we would expect to see when identifying points of seller exhaustion.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nSpeculatory Divergence\n\nThere has been a growing divergence in performance between Bitcoin and Ethereum during the 2023-23 cycle thus far. This has manifested as weaker price performance for ETH, and can be explained by an overall weaker capital rotation trend, especially relative to past cycles and ATH breaks.\n\nGlassnode, UkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Alice Kohn\nMay 7, 2024 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe Fourth Bitcoin Halving initially led to a sell-off, with BTC prices falling to $57k before recovering swiftly. This is now the deepest pullback since the FTX lows.\nEthereum exhibited similar price performance, experiencing its maximum drawdown of this cycle which was twice as severe as Bitcoin's.\nEthereum's under-performance this cycle relative to Bitcoin is reflected in a measurable lag in speculative interest from the Short-Term Holder cohort.\nBoth assets still have a relatively low Realized Cap associated with Long-Term Holders, suggesting the market is likely within the early stages of a macro uptrend.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nPrice Performance\n\nBitcoin halving events are well publicised in advance, and have historically been a choppy sell-the-news event in the immediate term. The fourth halving was no exception, with the BTC price selling off by -11%, and trading into the $57k region. This is the lowest price over the last 2 months, although the market has recovered to be flat since the halving date.\n\nStrangely enough, both of the prior two halving cycles saw price flat after two weeks, with only the first halving seeing an +11% gain. In general, the 60-days after halving events tend to be choppy, sideways, with a slight downwards drift to the of around of -5% to -15%.\n\n🔴 Epoch 2: +9.0%\n🔵Epoch 3: +0.4%\n🟢Epoch 4: -1.5%\n⚫ Epoch 5: 0.3%\nLive Workbench\n\nEthereum prices experienced a similar gravity, following the Bitcoin price lower immediately after the halving, and recording the worst post-halving performance on record. However in the following days, ETH prices have similarly recovered, bringing overall performance into positive territory.\n\n🔵 Epoch 3: +16%\n🟢 Epoch 4: -4%\n⚫ Epoch 5: +1.5%\nLive Workbench\n\nMeasured from the $73k ATH, Bitcoin prices corrected by -20.3%, which is the deepest correction on a closing basis since the FTX lows in Nov-2022. That said, this macro uptrend still appears to be one of the more resilient in history, with comparatively shallow corrections thus far.\n\nOf note, we can also observe a strikingly similarity in drawdown structure between our current cycle, and the 2015-17 Bull Market (blue). The 2015-17 uptrend occurred during Bitcoin’s infancy, with no derivative instruments available for the asset class. As such, this rally was entirely a spot driven market, which perhaps gives some indication that the current market structure may bear some similarities.\n\nA great deal of the leverage from the 2020-22 cycle was washed out in 2022, and the new US ETFs have added a non-trivial new vector for demand in spot markets.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nFor Ethereum, we can see a similar drawdown structure, with notably shallower corrections since the FTX lows. This hits to a degree of resilience during pullbacks, as well as a net reduction in volatility across the digital asset space.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that Ethereum's deepest drawdown of the cycle has been -44%, which is just over twice as severe as Bitcoin’s at -21%. This highlights Ethereum's relative under-performance over last 2 years, which is manifesting in a weaker ETH/BTC ratio also.\n\nLive Workbench\nInvestor Positioning\n\nIn order to compare relative performance between BTC and ETH, we can turn to the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric. Comparing NUPL allows us to see how the profitability of BTC vs ETH investors has fared relative to the average on-chain cost basis for each asset.\n\nA major threshold for this indicator is NUPL > 0.5, which generally aligns with the breaking to new ATHs, and the beginning of the Euphoria phase. A NUPL value above 0.5 signifies that the unrealized profit held by investors exceeds 50% of the asset market cap value.\n\nAmidst the hype and market rally surrounding approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, the unrealized profit of Bitcoin holders expanded considerably faster than that of Ethereum investors. As a result, the Bitcoin NUPL metric crossed 0.5 and entered the euphoria phase three months before than equivalent metric for Ethereum.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe Short-Term Holder cohort consists of investors who acquired their coins within the last 155 days, and are often considered a proxy for new investor demand. Typically, the average acquisition price of the cohort has acted as strong resistance during bearish trends, and a region of support during bullish trends.\n\nThis thesis has held up so far this week, with the Bitcoin market correcting down below the STH-Cost Basis at $59.8k, where it found support and rallied higher. Historically speaking, retests of the STH Cost Basis are common during up-trends, and provide a key level for monitoring potential inflection points should it fail to hold.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can assess the STH Cost Basis for Ethereum as well, which has provided support on several occasions in this uptrend already. Ethereum's STH-MVRV is trading at a very slight premium at the moment, which could suggest that spot prices are very close to the cost basis of recent buyers, who may panic should the market experience downside volatility.\n\nLive Workbench\nA Growing Divergence\n\nIn the run-up to Bitcoin's all-time high (ATH) on 14-March, there was a noticeable increase in speculative activity. Specifically, capital accumulation has been observed among short-term holders, with the USD wealth held withing coins moved within the last 6 months approaching $240B, near ATHs.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nHowever, this trend has not been mirrored for ETH, which has not yet seen price break above the 2021 ATH yet. Whilst Bitcoin's STH-Realized Cap is nearly on par with the last bull run peak, ETH's STH-Realized Cap has barely lifted off the lows, suggesting a markedly lacklustre inflow of new capital.\n\nIn many ways, this lack of new capital inflows is a reflection of the under-performance of ETH relative to BTC. This is likely in part due to the attention and access brought about by the spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe market is still awaiting the SEC's decision for approval of a suite of ETH ETFs expected towards the end of May.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nWe can take a similar analysis approach related to the Long-Term Holders, were we notice a significant decline taking place within the 2 to 3-year cohort. Some portion of this are coins acquired 3yrs ago (May 2021) maturing into the 3y-5y age band, but the rest an indication of profit taking an divestment.\n\nThis was likely influenced by the approval of the ETFs, with a significant proportion of this divestment occurring in February 2024, as the market rallied, and was about a month prior to BTC reaching its current $73k ATH. These Long-Term Holders historically wait for strong demand inflows to take profits into market strength.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nFor Ethereum, we continue to see ongoing HODLing behaviour, particularly in the 1 to 3-year cohorts. It appears that due to ETH's current under-performance, seasoned investors are sitting back and waiting patiently for higher prices.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nIf we examine the Spent Volume in Profit for LTHs, we can see that the cohort of BTC holders who have held for between 6 months and 2 years increased their divestment during the ATH rally.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nFrom this lens, Ethereum's Long-Term Holders once again appear to still be waiting for better profit-taking opportunities.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\n💡\nView these charts and many more in our new dashboard suite:\n\n- Bitcoin: Short-Term Holder Profitability Breakdown\n- Etherum: Short-Term Holder Profitability Breakdown\n- Bitcoin: Single-Cycle LTH Profitability Breakdown\n- Ethereum: Single-Cycle LTH Profitability Breakdown\n\nAs we established in WoC 08, capital inflows into ETH do tend to lag relative to BTC. In the 2021 cycle, the peak influx of new capital into BTC occurred 20 days before the peak influx into ETH. We can monitor the rotation of capital between these two assets via an assessment of the 30-day change in the Realized Cap.\n\nIn this instance, we have broken down this metric by Short and Long-Term Holders. For both assets, the Short-Term Holder variant peaked before the 2021 cycle top across both assets. This year, the BTC short-term holder Realized Cap has peaked around the new all-time high, whilst the ETH metric has hardly moved higher.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nFor the Long-Term Holder variant, both assets saw a relative maximum around the second cycle top. This is a very different interpretation, as it takes at least 155-days for capital to reach LTH status.\n\nAs such, this metric is describing top buyers from Q1 2021, who first acquired BTC, and then later in ETH, and who held onto their supply into the Oct-Nov 2021 peak. These buyers were likely the ones who weathered, and contributed to sell-side pressure throughout the 2022 bear market that followed.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nMarket action around the fourth Bitcoin halving was remarkably similar to prior cycles, with a temporary price drop to $57k, before rebounding to be flat overall. Ethereum markets followed a similar trajectory, however several metrics provided color to ETHs under-performance relative to BTC.\n\nWhen we break down capital flows and rotation between BTC and ETH, we can see that Bitcoin has received the lions share of inflows, likely driven in part by the US spot ETFs. Short-Term Holders and speculation activity appears concentrated within Bitcoin, with a remarkably weak spill-over into Ethereum thus far.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nSurviving Bull Drawdowns\n\nAs Bitcoin continues consolidating, we investigate which cohort of investors are contributing the most to sell-side activity. We also use our new Breakdown metric suite to build a set of rules for tracking local market lows during corrections.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nApr 30, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary:\nSince the March ATH at $73k, the Bitcoin market has transitioned into widespread net distribution, with coins taking advantage of liquidity and inflowing demand.\nAccording to the NUPL metric, the Bitcoin cycle remains within the Euphoria phase, however it has cooled off since the correction started.\nWe develop an example procedure for identifying potential inflection points and local lows, driven by various sub-sets of the Short-Term Holder cohort.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nDistribution in Fear\n\nThe Bitcoin market is still consolidating in the mid-$60k range, where prices have been constrained since the $73k ATH was reached in mid-March. In this edition, we will assess whether the behavior of investors during this consolidation is more heavily weighted towards distribution, or accumulation patterns.\n\nFirst, we will employ the Accumulation Trend Score to illustrate how investor accumulation patterns have shaped local tops and bottoms since the FTX crash.\n\nDuring the early stages of both the 2020-21 and 2023-24 bull runs, we can see a confluence between local regimes of distribution (light colours) and intervals of price contraction. As the market rallies to new highs, sell pressure is re-activated, as investors bring dormant supply back into the market to satisfy the inflowing demand.\n\nAs spot price reached new ATHs in mid-March, the same pattern of local distribution occurred, which was intensified as news around the conflict in the Middle East broke, causing a correction to $60.3k.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIf we inspect the breakdown of this metric by wallet sizes, we can complete a more detailed assessment. Here we see a distinct uptick in net outflows 🟥 across all cohorts throughout April, suggesting a consistent sell-side pressure across the board.\n\nLive Professional Dashboard\nUnrealized Pain & Gain Cycles\n\nA unique characteristic of the prevailing bull market has been the positive effect of US Spot ETF momentum on price action. The impact the ETFs have had on investor behavior can be explained via the Net Unrealized Profit & Loss (NUPL) metric, which measures the magnitude of net paper profits (or losses) held by the market (normalized by the market cap).\n\nUsing NUPL, we can identify the classic Euphoria phase of a bull market where unrealized profits surpass more than half the market capitalization size (NUPL > 0.5).\n\nIn the 2020-21 cycle, this phase was triggered 8.5 months after the Bitcoin halving, and saw sustained upside for almost 10.5 months afterwards. However, in this cycle, NUPL breached 0.5 approximately 6.5 months before the halving. This distinct shift highlights the significance of US ETF in shaping and accelerating price action by introducing powerful demand into the market.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nBy this metric, the Euphoria phase (NUPL>0.5) of this bull market has been in effect for last 7 months. Even the mightiest up-trends experience corrections however, and these events offer valuable information about investor positioning and sentiment.\n\nTo dive into the dynamics of bull market corrections, we have used two conditions.\n\nRelative Unrealized Profit 🟢> 0.5, showing the market is broadly shouldering a large magnitude of paper gains.\nRelative Unrealized Loss 🔴 > 0.01, meaning investors are experiencing significant financial pressure, holding large unrealized losses during the market correction\n\nAs shown in the following charts, these correction events are common and expected during all bull markets. Since touching the ATH at $73.1k, this structure has appeared across three separate retraces down to ~$60k zone.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench]\nNavigating Local Bottoms\n\nHaving confirmed that we are within the Euphoria zone, and with an expectation of corrections, the next part of this report focuses on building a compass for navigating these contractions when they happen.\n\nThe first step is to identify the aggressive side of the market during a correction, which we define as the cohort contributing the most to the duration and depth of each pullback.\n\nWe can use the Realized Loss breakdown metric (denominated in USD) to identify that short-term holders (recent buyers) are displaying a marked dominance at the moment.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nHaving established that Short-Term Holders in Loss is a cohort of interest, we will use Glassnode’s new Breakdown metric suite to dissect the cost basis of these recent buyers.\n\nAmong these younger age bands, the cost basis of 1m-3m 🟠 and 3m-6m 🟡 cohorts emerge as valuable tools for distinguishing the bull and bear market structures. The 1w-1m 🔴 cost basis, however, has shown to correspond with market inflection points, helping us spot potential local bottoms (in bull markets) and local tops (in bear markets).\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThe spot Price frequently reacts to the 1w-1m cost basis, which is an idea we initially explored in our research article on short-term holder and long-term behavioural analysis. This is due to recent buyers being more price sensitive and having a higher probability of spending in the short term.\n\nTherefore, during bull market corrections, short-term holders tend to ramp up their spending as the market starts to sell-off. As the market price approaches each sub-cohort's cost basis, their pace of spending can be anticipated to slow down (seller exhaustion).\n\nHere, we have chosen the 1w-1m realized price (cost-basis) as a compass for identifying points of potential seller exhaustion in the near-term.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWe can use the ratio between the spot price and each cohort cost basis via the MVRV ratio to gauge the typical deviations during corrections.\n\nThe following chart shows that the MVRV (1w-1m) ratio usually drops into the 0.9-1 range during the bull market pullbacks. This means the market typically falls 0% to -10% below the 1w-1m investors' average cost basis.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nHaving now sized up the implied pressure on 1w-1m investors, we can directly trace the intensity of their panic and fear (measured via realized loss). Our approach is to highlight regimes of aggressive selling pressure by the subgroup of investors in question.\n\nHere, we have presented the realized loss by 1w-1m old entities, denominated in USD. Next, we have identified points of high-loss realization intervals using some simple statistical means ( > 1 standard deviation).\n\nNote that realized loss for this group tends to peak near local market lows, as recent buyers panic sell their coins.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nIf we combine both of these conditions we described above, we can formulate a conditional toolkit for spotting potential local low inflection points:\n\nMVRV (1m-1w) is below 1, but above 0.9 and,\nRealized Loss (1w-1m) exceeds +1sd on a 90-day window\n\nWe now have a compass to uncover structures where the short-term holders potentially reach seller exhaustion.\n\nAt the time of writing, the cost basis of 1w-1m holders is $66.7k, while their realized loss has surpassed the 90-day +1sd level on multiple occasions since mid-March. Since the price resides within the $60k to $66.7k range, the MVRV condition is met, and it could be argued that the market is hammering out a local bottom formation. That said, a sustained break below that MVRV level could create a cascade of panic and force a new equilibrium to be found and established.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nConclusions and Summary\n\nIn this piece, we established that the Bitcoin market transitioned into a regime of widespread net distribution since the March ATH at $73k. The NUPL metric indicates we are within a Euphoria phase, however it has cooled off meaningfully since the correction started.\n\nCorrections offer valuable information regarding the sentiment and sell-side activity of investors. We derived an example procedure for identifying a sub-set of Short-Term Holders who are influencing the market with the greatest sell-side activity. From this, we developed some simple rules using Glassnode’s new Breakdown metric suite, which may help in identifying that seller exhaustion within this cohort is becoming a factor at local lows.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Fourth Halving\n\nThe fourth Bitcoin Halving has occurred, leading to a 50% reduction in supply inflation and an inherent increase in issuance scarcity. In this edition, we explore the evolution of the Bitcoin network across Epochs with respect to price performance, and fundamental network metrics.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nApr 23, 2024 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe Fourth Bitcoin Halving has occurred, reducing the annualized inflation rate of the Bitcoin Supply by 50%, and decisively surpassing Gold in terms of issuance scarcity.\nWhen measuring across Halving Epochs, diminishing growth rates are noted across multiple network statistics, whilst the absolute value of these measures continues to climb to new ATHs.\nInvestor profitability has been bolstered by a rising spot price and a decisive ATH break, which has dampened the 50% reduction in revenue for miners relative to the start of the year.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nA Disinflationary Supply\n\nThe Bitcoin supply curve is deterministic due to the ingenious mining algorithm called the Difficulty Adjustment. This protocol adjusts the difficulty of the Bitcoin mining process such that no matter how few, or how many mining rigs are applied, the average block interval remains anchored at around 600-seconds (10mins).\n\nEvery 210,000 blocks (roughly a 4 year time period), a pre-determined reduction in issuance occurs, reducing the newly minted BTC coins by 50%. The fourth Bitcoin Halving took place over the weekend, seeing the block subsidy decline from 6.25BTC to 3.125BTC per block, or an approximate issuance of 450 BTC per day (for 144 blocks mined).\n\nLive Chart\n\nEntering the Fourth Epoch, 19,687,500 BTC has been mined and issued, equivalent to 93.75% of the terminal supply of 21M BTC. Thus there remains only 1,312,500 BTC to issued over the next 126 years, with 656,600 (3.125%) being issued across our current Epoch. Interestingly, each halving represents a point where:\n\nThe percent of supply remaining equals the new block subsidy (3.125 BTC/block vs 3.125% remaining).\n50% of the remaining supply (1.3125M BTC) will be mined between the fourth and fifth halving.\nLive Workbench\n\nWith the block subsidy halving every 210,000 blocks, the inflation rate is also halved roughly every 4 years. This puts the new annualized inflation rate of the Bitcoin supply at a value of 0.85%, down from 1.7% in the prior epoch.\n\nThe fourth halving also marks a significant milestone in the comparison of Bitcoin to Gold as for the first time in history, Bitcoin’s steady-state issuance rate (0.83%) becomes lower than Gold (~2.3%), marking a historic handover in the title of scarcest asset.\n\nKeeping Perspective\n\nIt is important however to keep the scale of the halving in perspective. When assessing the relative impact of the halving on market dynamics, the volume of freshly minted coins does remain very small compared to the global trade volume within the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nIssuance is a fraction of the on-chain transfer volumes, spot volume and derivatives volume we see today, and is currently equivalent to less than 0.1% of the aggregate capital moved and traded on any given day.\n\nThus the impact that Bitcoin halvings have on the available traded supply is diminishing across cycles, not only due to the reduction in mined coins, but also as the size of the asset and ecosystem expand around it.\n\nLive Workbench\nGrounding Expectations\n\nThe Halving is an important and well publicised event, naturally leading to heightened speculation around its impact on price action. It can be a useful to balance our expectations against historical precedence, and create loose boundaries based upon past performance.\n\nThe price performance of Bitcoin across various halving epochs has a very wide spread, and we argue the earlier epochs are too different to today to be much of a guide. We do see both a diminishing returns, and shallower total drawdown effect over time, which is a natural result of the growing market size, and the scale of capital flows required to move it.\n\n🔴 Epoch 2 Price Performance: +5315% with a max drawdown of -85%\n🔵 Epoch 3 Price Performance: +1336% with a max drawdown of -83%\n🟢 Epoch 4 Price Performance: +569% with a max drawdown of -77%\nLive Workbench\n\nAssessing the price performance since the cycle low up until the Halving, we note a stark similarity between the 2015, 2018 and our current cycle, all experiencing an increase of around ~200% to ~300%.\n\nHowever, our current cycle has been the only one on record to decisively break the previous ATH before the halving event.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nAnother lens is to check market performance is in the 365-days following each halving. Epoch 2 saw a substantially larger performance, but we must consider that the dynamics and landscape of the market today has evolved significantly relative to the 2011-2013 period.\n\nTherefore, the two most recent Epochs (3 and 4) provide a more informative depiction of the impact of asset size.\n\n🔴 Epoch 2 Price Performance: +7,258% with a max drawdown of -69.4%\n🔵 Epoch 3 Price Performance: +293% with a max drawdown of -29.6%\n🟢 Epoch 4 Price Performance: +266% with a max drawdown of -45.6%\n\nWhilst the year following a halving event is historically strong, it has come with some serious gut-check drawdowns along the way, ranging from -30% to -70%.\n\n💡\nFor more information regarding Price Performance across Cycles, visit our Dashboard here.\nLive Workbench\nHistory Rhymes, Sometimes\n\nDuring the bear market of 2022, a common narrative was that prices would never drop below the previous cycle ATH ($20k set in 2017 at the time). This was of course invalidated as prices collapsed more than 25% below the 2017 cycle high during the widespread deleveraging in late 2022.\n\nA similar narrative circulated of late that prices could not break to a new the ATH before the halving had occurred. Once again, this was invalided in March this year. The ATH we saw in March comes off the back of both a historically tight supply (WoC-46-2023), and the remarkable demand interest brought online via the new spot ETFs.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThis price increase has also had meaningful effects on the unrealized profit held by investors. Currently, unrealized profit held within the coin supply is the largest it has ever been moving into a Halving event (as measured by MVRV).\n\nIn other words, investors are holding the largest paper gains relative to their cost basis as of a halving date. With the MVRV Ratio is trading at 2.26, this means the average unit of BTC is holding a +126% paper gain.\n\nLive Workbench\nFundamental Growth\n\nIn the previous section we assessed historical price performance centred around the Halving. In the next section, we will shift our focus to the growth of network fundamentals, ranging from mining security, miner revenues, asset liquidity and settlement volumes over halving epochs.\n\nHashrate is a network statistic for evaluating the collective ‘firepower’ of the mining cohort. Across halving epochs, the rate of growth in hashrate has slowed, however the absolute Hashes per second continues to expand, now at 620 Exahash per second (equivalent to all 8-billion people on earth completing 77.5-billion hashes every second).\n\nInterestingly, hashrate has been at or near a new ATHs entering each halving event, which suggests two scenarios could be occurring;\n\nMore ASIC rigs are coming online and/or,\nMore efficient hashing ASIC hardware is being produced.\n\nThe conclusion drawn from both of these scenarios is that despite issuance being reduced by 50% each halving, the aggregate security budget has been sufficient not only to sustain current OPEX costs, but also to stimulate further investment across both the CAPEX and OPEX domains.\n\n💡\nFor further information regarding the growth across several on-chain metrics through each Halving Epoch, visit our Dashboard here.\nLive Workbench\n\nMiner revenues are similarly seeing a diminishing growth rate when denominated in USD, but a net expansion in absolute size. Cumulative miner revenue topped a staggering $3B over the past four years, increasing by an order of magnitude over the prior Epoch.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe Realized Cap is a powerful tool to measure the capital invested and stored within Bitcoin over time, and can be used to compare USD denominated liquidity growth across cycles.\n\nA net total of $560B worth of USD value has been ‘stored’ within Bitcoin by this measure. The realized cap increased by 439% over the last epoch, which supports the now $1.4 trillion dollar market cap of the asset. It is also noteworthy that Bitcoin continues to see capital inflows despite the infamous volatility, bad headlines, and cyclical drawdowns.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nFinally, if we evaluate transfer volumes settled across halving epochs, we can see that over the last four years, a staggering $106T worth of economic value was transferred and settled by the network. Now it is important to note that this is considering raw unfiltered volumes, and does not adjust for internal wallet management.\n\nNevertheless, each transaction was settled without intermediaries, and highlights the incredible value throughput capacity of the Bitcoin network at scale.\n\nLive Workbench\nConclusions and Summary\n\nWith the highly anticipated Halving complete, the issuance emission per block has been halved and the scarcity of the asset hardened, with the Bitcoin asset decisively overtaking gold in terms of issuance scarcity.\n\nComparing across Epochs, a contraction in growth can be noted across Hashrate, Network Settlemend, Liquidity and Miner Revenue. However, the absoloute value of these metrics has increased by an order of magnitude, an incredibly impressive feat when observed in relation to the size of the market.\n\nOf note, network profitability across all walks of market investors has largely imrproved in relation to previous Halvings. This includes the fundamental Miner class, who have entered the Halving with an ATH in Hashrate, suggesting a sufficient security budget to stimulate OpEx and CapEx requirements.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

This is motivated by a surge in demand for Liquid Staking and Restaking protocols.\n\nGlassnode, Alice Kohn\nApr 16, 2024 • 6 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe Ethereum community is currently engaged in a heated debate regarding the ETH monetary policy following proposals to reduce the ETH issuance rate.\nNew innovations such as Liquid Staking, Restaking, and Liquid Restaking have introduced additional yield opportunities, significantly boosting staking demand.\nConcerns are that the increasing prevalence of staking derivatives may dilute Ethereum's function as money, and shift the governance power of the network.\n\nThis weekend saw an uptick in geopolitical tension in the Middle East, culminating in drone attacks on Israel last Saturday. Given cryptocurrency markets are the only assets that trade over weekends, this triggered a notable downturn in digital asset markets. BTC fell by -8%, while ETH prices declined by -13%. Markets recovered slightly, but have continued trading sideways to downward, with investors cautious of longer term impacts.\n\nIn the Ethereum ecosystem, there has also been a significant ongoing debate regarding potential changes to its issuance rate. This discussion was sparked when proposals from two Ethereum researchers were made, suggesting to slow ETH issuance, and hence reduce staking rewards.\n\nThe overarching aim is to reduce the growth of the staking pool, in a bid to manage the rising dominance of new innovations such as Liquid Staking and Restaking, and protect Ethereum's function as money.\n\nStaking on Ethereum has experienced unexpectedly high demand, with the amount of ETH actively participating in Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake currently stands at 31.4M ETH (~26% of the total supply). We can see that the growth rate of staked ETH is picking up in recent months. This is particularly following the introduction of new innovations such as the Eigenlayer Restaking protocol in June 2023, and the Liquid Restaking protocols in early 2024.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nDistorted Incentives\n\nOriginally, the Proof-of-Stake protocol was designed such that as more ETH is staked, the marginal revenue for each validator declines. This mechanism self-regulates the size of the staking pool, and with 31.4M ETH currently staked, the estimated annual APY per validator stands at around 3.2%.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nHowever, new developments such as yield sourced from MEV, Liquid Staking, Restaking, and Liquid Restaking have introduced additional opportunities. As a result, the incentive and demand for users to stake is increasing beyond the original vision.\n\nIf we categorise staked deposits by their origin, it reveals a notable increase in ETH staked by Liquid Restaking providers since the beginning of the year. These protocols now account for 27% of newly staked ETH, whilst new deposits by Liquid Staking providers have dwindled since mid-March.\n\nRestaking was introduced last year by the protocol EigenLayer. EigenLayer enables users to deposit their staked ETH or Liquid Staking Tokens into EigenLayer smart contracts. These assets can then be used as security collateral by other services such as rollups, oracles, and bridges. Restakers earn additional fees from these services, in addition to their native staking yield from the Ethereum mainchain.\n\nStaking on Eigenlayer has surged since the protocol's launch, with the total value locked (TVL) now over 14.2M ETH (~$13B). These high levels of demand for restaking is also partly due to the anticipation of an Eigenlayer airdrop campaign.\n\nOver 61.1% of Eigenlayer's TVL comes from native staked ETH, while the remainder is made up of Liquid Staking Tokens, with Lido's stETH leading the pack, making up for 21.5% of the total TVL.\n\nThe Rise of Liquid Restaking\n\nLiquid Restaking operates much like Liquid Staking, allowing users to restake their tokens and receive a liquid representation of their restaked assets in return. This is an option that seems to be preferred by Eigenlayer users, with 63% of deposits into Eigenlayer made through Liquid Restaking providers.\n\nResearchers at the Ethereum Foundation have raised concerns about the high and growing staking rate. Whilst staking more ETH yields a lower reward rate per validator, the total rewards paid out may still contribute to inflation if the total amount of staked ETH becomes substantial. Currently around 1.01% of the total ETH supply consist of newly issued tokens since The Merge, although this is offset by ~3.55% of the supply burned over the same time.\n\nLive Advance Chart\n\nAs more ETH moves into staking pools, the impacts of inflation starts to impacts an increasingly small number of ETH holders. In other words, there is a wealth transfer taking place from a shrinking pool of non-staked ETH holders, towards a growing pool of staked ETH holders.\n\nOver time, this 'real yield' component risks making holding ETH less appealing, and could erode ETH's function as a monetary asset within the Ethereum ecosystem. Instead, the role of 'money' could migrate towards Liquid Staking Tokens like stETH, or even to Liquid Restaking Tokens, which function as supercharged yield-bearing instrument. A side-effect of such a development would be the projects which issue these derivative tokens gaining an outsized influence over the governance and stability of Ethereum's execution and consensus layers.\n\nToday, we already note that half of the staked ETH is provided through those derivative projects. 42% of the staked ETH is re-liquified by Liquid Staking Tokens, and an additional 8% through Liquid Restaking derivatives.\n\nThe Ethereum researcher;s concern that also applies to Ethereum's moneyness. Of the total ETH supply, 11% is held in Liquid Staking Tokens and 2.2% in Liquid Restaking Tokens.\n\nThe proposals made by the Ethereum Foundation aim to limit and constrain annual issuance, thus reducing the incentives for new stakers to enter the pool, and hopefully slowing staking growth rates.. The proposals have received significant pushback from the community, with many arguing that no change is currently necessary, and challenging the need to update the ETH monetary policy once again.\n\nHowever, he growth of the staking pool was already constrained slightly during the last Decun upgrade. The hardfork introduced a limit of 8 new validators per 6.4-minute epoch, and replaced the churn limit function. This effectively capped the number of validators and the amount of stake that can enter the staking pool, providing very mild relief for the time being.\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nThe Ethereum ecosystem is debating proposed changes the ETH issuance rate, aimed at slowing down the expansion of the staking pool. The goal is to mitigate the influence of innovations like Liquid Staking and Restaking, which are acting to enhance the yield opportunities, and thus demand from users.\n\nThe surge in staking—now at 31.4M ETH or roughly 26% of the total supply—has been driven by Restaking protocols like Eigenlayer. These developments are increasingly leading to the proliferation of of liquid staking tokens, which over the long-term may start to undermine Ethereum's role as a money asset. The Ethereum Foundation has suggested capping annual issuance to slow the growth of the staking pool, however these proposals have been met with significant resistance from the community.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nSpot Driven Rally\n\nIn this edition, we analyse the surge in both spot trading, and onchain exchange volumes for Bitcoin underlying the strong YTD performance. The market has also transitioned into a euphoric phase, as profit-taking has climbed accordingly.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nApr 9, 2024 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBitcoin’s strong performance over the last 12 months is supported by a surge in both spot trade volume but also exchange deposit and withdrawal volumes.\nBy inspecting the cumulative volume delta (CVD), we can see that a majority of 2023 saw net selling activity on the taker side, even though corrections have been historically mild and less than 20%.\nProfit taking by long-term holders spiked meaningfully into the $73k ATH and is cooling down in recent weeks. This comes alongside an uptick in new demand brought on by the US spot ETFs.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nRising Speculation\n\nIt continues to be an impressive year for Bitcoin, with prices consolidating between $64k and $73k over the last week. Bitcoin markets have seen a surge in spot trade volume since the US Spot ETFs went live in early January 2024, with daily volumes peaking at ~$14.1B in mid-March as the market reached the $73k ATH.\n\nThis magnitude of spot trade volume is equivalent to the height of the 2020-2021 bull market, although it has started to cool down in recent weeks, currently at $7B/day.\n\nBinance still commands a 37.5% market share in spot markets; however, this dominance is declining relative to the prior cycle. In 2021, Binance accounted for around 50% of trade volume in 2021, but also an incredible 85%+ in the deepest phase of the 2022 bear market.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nTo assess overall market momentum, we can employ a simple slow/fast-moving average model applied to spot volumes. Here, we compare the 180D-MA (slow) and 30D-MA (fast) to assess whether spot trade volumes are warming up or cooling down.\n\nPrice action since October 2023 has seen the faster average trade significantly higher than the slower one, indicating that the YTD performance is supported by strong demand in spot markets. A similar structure is apparent during the 2021 bull run.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nTo bolster this observation, we can apply a similar fast/slow momentum indicator to the on-chain transfer volumes deposited 🔴 or withdrawn 🟢 from all exchanges wallets we monitor.\n\nWe can see a similar positive momentum signal to what has been in play since July 2023, suggesting the flow of coins in and out of exchanges is also heightened. The monthly average of total Exchange Flows (inflows plus outflows) is currently at $8.19B per day, significantly higher than the peak in the 2020-2021 bull market.\n\nOverall, Bitcoin’s YTD price action is supported by a significant uptick in spot trade volume, and exchange flows onchain.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nOur recent newsletter (WoC 10) showcased how the new US Spot ETFs have become a dominant force in the market. These new instruments introduced a significant source of new demand into the market, more than offsetting the daily issuance, as well as sell-side pressure from GBTC and existing holders.\n\nThis conclusion can be reinforced by comparing spot trade volumes 🟧 and ETF trade volumes 🟦. There is strong correlation between these markets, with ETFs trading around 30% of the size of global spot markets. We can also see the seasonality impact of weekends, where ETF markets are closed, and spot trade volumes are notably lower.\n\nBuy Side vs Sell Side Volume\n\nAnother tool that enables us to characterise spot markets is the Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD). This metric describes the net bias in market taker buy vs sell volume, measured in USD.\n\nSuppose we isolate the major positive peaks 🟩, where the taker buy volume minus the taker sell volume exceeds $60M. In that case, we can see a remarkable similarity between market sentiment in Q1-2021 and the post-ETF market.\n\nBy mid-March, the spot volume delta reached +$143.6M, which is slightly lower than the peak in February 2021 ($145.2M) but indicates a major shift towards a net buy-side bias. Notably, most of 2023 experienced a net sell-side bias in spot markets despite the fact that markets had minimal pullbacks, and steadily climbed higher.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWe can break this Spot CVD metric into individual volume deltas at specific exchanges. The chart below represents the following traces:\n\nBinance 🟨\nCoinbase 🟦\nAll Other Exchanges 🟥\n\nDuring the 2020-21 bull market, Coinbase and Other Exchanges experienced a net buy-side bias, while Binance saw the sell-side dominate. Much of 2023 saw a net sell-side bias across all exchanges until October, when this flipped into a net buy-side.\n\nOne interpretation would be that the significant sell-side bias by takers in 2023 was met with a comparatively larger bid on the maker side. This patient buy side throughout last year could be a key reason for the relatively light pullbacks (max -20%) seen since the FTX lows (stay tuned for a chart showing this later in this report).\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nNavigating The Cycle\n\nWe have established that the strong performance of Bitcoin over the last 12-18 months is supported by a meaningful uptick in trade volumes. Next, we will explore charts that can help us navigate the market cycle during price discovery.\n\nA vital tool for mapping bitcoin cycles is the Supply Profitability State, which considers the percentage of the total coin supply which are held in profit. The chart below represents the Percentage of Supply in Profit alongside two statistical bands, set at +1 SD 🟢 and -1 SD 🔴.\n\nPeriods when supply in profit trades above +1SD (~95% in profit) are naturally aligned with the market rallying towards the prior cycle ATH (Pre-Euphoria), as well as breaking beyond it (Euphoria).\n\nWe can see a common pattern in this tool in the prior cycle, where an initial Pre-Euphoria rally tests the upper band and puts a super-majority of coins into profit. After a period of correction and consolidation, the market finally rallies up to and through the prior ATH, driving the oscillator well above 95% in profit status.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nAs a result, the unrealized profit held by market participants increases significantly. This of course, creates a growing incentive for investors to ramp up profit-taking (realizing profit). The following chart shows the weekly sum volume Realized Profit, normalized by market cap to compare across cycles 🟩.\n\nAs the market reclaimed the 2021 cycle high, this metric peaked at 1.8%, suggesting 1.8% of the market cap was locked in as profit over a 7-day period. This is significant but remains comparatively lower than the profit-taking intensity during the January 2021 rally (3.0%.)\n\nIn terms of market mechanics, this dynamic provides us with a few pieces of information:\n\nProfit-taking, typically by long-term holders, tends to ramp up around ATH breaks.\nLocal and global market peaks are often established after major profit-taking events.\nProfit taken by one investor is matched by inflowing demand from the buying party on the other side. This gives us an insight into the magnitude of new capital flowing into Bitcoin.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIf we return to the magnitude of drawdowns we alluded to earlier, we can see that despite the large-scale profit taking by existing holders, the magnitude of pullbacks remains historically small.\n\nIf we compare the ATH break in prior cycles, it could be argued that current Euphoria phase (market in price discovery) is still relatively young. Previous Euphoria phases have seen numerous price drawdowns exceeding -10%, with the majority being much deeper, with 25%+ being commonplace.\n\nThe current market has seen just two ~10%+ corrections since the ATH was broken.\n\nLive Standard Workbench\nAn Influx of New Investors\n\nThere are always two sides to a market; for every investor taking profits, another investor acquires those coins at a higher cost. We can visualise this influx of new investors by the rising share of wealth held by coins younger than 6-months in the Realized Cap HODL Waves.\n\nDuring the last two bull markets, the aggregate share of < 6-month-old wealth reached between 84% and 95%, indicating a saturation of newer holders. This metric has increased dramatically since early 2023, rising from 20% on 1-Jan-2023 to 47% today.\n\nThis suggests that the capital held within the Bitcoin holder base is roughly balanced between long-term holders and new demand.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThis also means that analysts should start to pay more attention to the behaviour of these new investors as their share of the capital increases.\n\nBy definition, there are no Long-Term Holders with coins held at a loss shortly after a new ATH break (at least 155 days after the event). As such, Short-Term Holders (STHs) will dominate all onchain metrics describing supply or volume ‘in-loss’. Accordingly, STH now represents ~100% of the Total Realized Losses on spent coins 🔴.\n\nIf we consider this ‘STH Loss Dominance’ across prior cycles, we can see that this condition has lasted for between 6.5 and 13.5 months until the bear market sets in. The current market has only entered this condition for around 1-month so far.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe strong market performance of Bitcoin over the last 12 months is supported by a remarkable uptick in both spot trade volumes and onchain flows associated with exchanges. By analysing the Cumulative Volume Delta, we can also gauge that the demand side has been remarkably strong, albeit with bids patiently taking the maker side rather than the taker side.\n\nWith the market now above the 2021 ATH, profit-taking has ramped up but is cooling down in recent weeks. The balance of wealth is approximately balanced between long-term holders and new demand, suggesting the ‘Euphoria’ phase is still relatively early from a historical perspective.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nLiquidity Abundance\n\nAs the Bitcoin Spot Price consolidates below the new ATH of $73k, the Long-Term Holder cohort has entered their distribution phase, selling to new investors at higher prices. This represents an injection of new capital into the asset class, driving the realized cap up to new heights.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nApr 2, 2024 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary:\nCapital continues to flow into Bitcoin, with the Realized Cap rising to a new high of $540B, and seeing rates of capital inflow into the asset now exceeding $79B/month.\nThe transfer of wealth from Long-Term Holders back to new demand is accelerating, with over 44% of the network wealth now owned by coins aged less than 3 months old.\nProfit taking continues to dominate investor behavior, with both the Long and Short-Term Holder cohorts taking chips off the table. Overall profit dominance is however shifting towards the Long-Term Holders.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nA Rising Tide of Liquidity\n\nBitcoin’s price action decisively broke above the previous cycle ATH in early March, triggering a transition into price discovery. As we covered last week (WoC-13), this has motivated a significant volume of supply to be spent and take profits.\n\nThis results in spent coins generally being revalued from a lower cost-basis, to a higher one. As these coins change hands, we can also consider this to be an injection of fresh demand and liquidity into the asset class.\n\nThis mechanic is elegantly expressed by the Realized Cap metric, tracking the cumulative USD liquidity ‘stored’ in the asset the class. The Realized Cap is now at a new ATH value of $540B, and is increasing at an unprecedented rate of over $79B/month.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can break down the age bands of the Realized Cap using the Realized Cap HODL Wave metric. This tool is particularly useful for distinguishing the distribution of USD denominated wealth held across various age bands.\n\nIf we segregate for coin-ages younger than 3 months, we can see a sharp increase over recent months, with these newer investors now owning ~44% of the aggregate network wealth. This uptick in younger coins is a direct result of Long-Term Holders spending their coins at higher prices to satisfy the wave of inflowing demand.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIt is typical in prior Bitcoin cycles that an uptick in new demand tends to come alongside an elevated appetite for speculation. This tends to result in increasingly volatile markets, which is characteristic of macro up-trends in prior Bitcoin cycles.\n\n90-day realized volatility has nearly doubled from 28% to 55% since October 2023, which marked the point where Realized Cap inflows started to accelerate higher.\n\nLive Chart\nDormant Supply Reawakens\n\nFollowing a historical tightness in supply (see WoC-46-2023), the divergence between Long and Short-Term Holder supply has started closing. As prices rise, and unrealized profits held by investors increase, it entices Long-Term Holders (LTHs) to part with their holdings.\n\nLTH Supply has declined by -900k BTC since the peak of 14.91M BTC set in Dec 2023, with the GBTC trust outflows responsible for around one third of this (approx. -286k BTC).\n\nConversely, the Short-Term Holder Supply has increased by +1.121M BTC, absorbing the LTH distribution pressure, as well as acquiring an additional 121k BTC from the secondary market via exchanges.\n\nNote: LTH and STH Supply are displayed here on separate y-axes for ease of visualisation.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can supplement this observation by assessing the ratio between the Long and Short-Term Holder supply. Once more, a pronounced decline is visible in all macro up-trends as the dominant investor behavior moves from Long-Term HODLing, towards distribution, profit taking, and speculation.\n\n💡\nA key takeaway from these observations is the distinct phase shift in investor behavior patterns as new market ATHs are reached. The distribution pressure by Long-Term Holders tends to accelerate to satisfy new demand at higher prices.\n\nWhilst the new US ETFs are an important new component of market structure, these trends are visible in on-chain data throughout all prior cycles.\nLive Workbench\n\nThe chart below breaks down the BTC supply by on-chain cost basis, as well as by Long/Short-Term Holder cohort.\n\nWe can see that approximately 1.875M BTC (9.5% of circulating) have been acquired above $60k, with a majority designated by the Short-Term Holder cohort 🔴. This will include new spot buyers, and approximately 508k BTC now held in US Spot ETFs (excl. GBTC).\n\nLive in Engine Room\n\nWe can bolster the aforementioned observations using the Liveliness metric, which describes the aggregate balance of ‘holding time’ stored within the supply.\n\nLiveliness is experiencing a sustained uptick which indicates that in aggregate, the expendature of long-dormant coins is outpacing the accumulation of ‘holding time’ by HODLed coins. This reiterates the thesis that the market has transitioned into a regime where spending and profit taking is now the dominant market mechanic.\n\nLive Chart\nTools for Assessing Uptrends\n\nAnalysing markets is always seeking the balance between supply and demand, with two sides to every coin. For example, profit taking by Long-Term Holders is both a measure of sell-side pressure, but also a read on new demand inflows by Short-Term Holders.\n\nFurthermore, with the market trading at or near new ATHs, coins which are realizing a loss, especially those from the STH cohort, are explicitly sourced from buyers who acquired near the ‘local top’.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: Many of the concepts explored in this section relate to our Analysis Framework for Bitcoin Bull Markets dashboard.\n\nWith this as context, we can use several powerful on-chain metrics to compare the profit and loss taking events of these two key, but fundamentally opposite market cohorts (LTHs and STHs). We will use a set of three core metrics:\n\nRealized Profit and Loss - Being the total change in the value of spent coins from their original cost basis, to the spot price when they were moved.\nRealized Profit/Loss Ratios - which oscillate around an equilibrium value of 1 in logarithmic scale, and is an ideal tool for spotting market inflection points. An example is where Realized Losses accelerate in an exponential manner during uptrends, increasing from ‘not much’ to ‘something meaningful’ (indicating trapped local/global top buyers are starting to panic spend).\nSell-Side Risk Ratio - being a ratio between total Realized Profit + Realized Loss divided by the Realized Cap. In other words, this metric describes a ratio between total change in coin value (the disturbing force) and the total size of the market (the object being moved).\n\nStarting with Short-Term Holders, we can see that their Profit / Loss ratio remains well within a profit dominated regime, with profit taking outsizing losses by 50x. Regular retests of the equilibrium level of 1.0 suggests that profits are being absorbed, and investors are generally defending their cost basis during corrections.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can also see that STH Realized losses spike during dips as local top buyers panic spend on expectations the market may go lower. The magnitude of realized loss is also increasing for each successive correction, which suggests a growth in the volume and size of top buyers for each leg higher.\n\nLive Chart\n\nNext, we will assess the Sell-Side Risk Ratio for STHs to evaluate the relative scale of their profit or loss taking events.\n\nHigh values indicate that STHs are spending coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis, and the market likely needs to re-find equilibrium (usually follows a volatile price move).\nLow values indicate that the majority of coins being spent are close to their break even cost basis, suggesting a degree of equilibrium has been reached, and an exhaustion of ‘profit and loss’ within the current price range (usually describes a low volatility environment).\n\nFollowing the rally above $70k, the STH Sell-Side Risk Ratio spiked meaningfully, which typically occurs around market inflection points (global and local). This generally suggests that a new equilibrium has not yet formed, and the metric is correcting sharply as the market corrects and consolidates.\n\n💡\nHint for Analysts: Sell-Side Risk Ratios tend to behave in a similar manner to Realized Volatility and Options Implied Volatility, providing an on-chain measure of volatility.\nLive Workbench\n\nMoving onto our assessment of LTHs, we can see their Realized Profit / Loss Ratio has gone exponential and vertical. By definition, this is a result of there being no LTHs in Loss when the market has only recently broken above the last cycles ATH. This is further fuelled by the aformentioned uptick in LTH profit taking.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWhilst it is quite useful to track the Realized Losses of STHs during up-trends, it is more useful to monitor the Realized Profit of LTHs, as this acts as a key component of distribution pressures. To illustrate this point, we can see that LTH Realized Losses have tailed off to just $3,500 per day, compared to the $114M by STHs during the recent correction.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs LTH Realized Profits accelerate, their Sell-Side Risk Ratio has started to rally, particularly since October 2023. This metric is increasing well in line with historical ATH breaks suggesting that the distribution pressure and profit taking by the LTH cohort are similar to prior cycles on a relative basis.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nAcross a wide variety on-chain tools and metrics, we can see a distinct shift in investor behavior patterns. Long-Term Holders are well into their distribution cycle, realizing profits, and re-awakening dormant supply to satisfy new demand at higher prices.\n\nUsing on-chain cohorts, we can also develop a suite of tools and indicators to identify local and global inflection points, leveraging profit / loss metrics in particular. The combination of LTH and STH cohorts, alongside their profit / loss taking behaviors, provides a relatively unprecedented look into investor psychology, sentiment, and capital flows.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nTaking Profit\n\nAs the Bitcoin market hits resistance at a new ATH of $73k, the Long-Term Holder cohort have ramped up their overall distribution pressure. The market is currently seeing over $2.6B/day in realized profit, as investors start to take chips off the table.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nMar 26, 2024 • 5 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBitcoin prices have pulled back -15.4% from the new $73k ATH, reaching as low as $61k. This price action aligns very closely with the prior 2018-21 cycle.\nSeveral on-chain indicators have flagged an uptick in profit taking events, with over $2.6B in realized profit taken as the market reached resistance.\nThe overall Bitcoin market has several similarities to prior ATH breakouts, specifically related to distribution pressure by the Long-Term Holder cohort.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nThe Bitcoin market has taken a breather from the powerful uptrend over the last two weeks, and has corrected and consolidated above $61k. BTC prices pulled back -15.4% from the new $73.1k ATH set on 13-March, trading down to a local low of $61.8k on 20-March, before recovering back to $70k.\n\nIf we index price performance (black) since the April 2021 ATH (where we argue bear market sentiment set in), we can see a remarkable similarity to the prior cycle (blue). By both duration and distance from the April 2021 peak, the market is in a near identical spot to December 2020 relative to the 2018-21 cycle.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn our video report from last week, we explored how the Bitcoin market had reached several statistically significant levels with respect to Unrealized profit held within the supply. Metrics like MVRV and the AVIV Ratio reached +1 standard deviation from their long-term means.\n\nPast instances have historically been points of interest, where the market finds a degree of resistance, and some investors start to take profits and chips off the table.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs prices traded down from the ATH and to recent low of $61.2k, a total of 2.0M BTC switched from a status of being 'in-profit' to being 'in-loss'. This provides an indication of the volume of coins that have transacted at a new elevated cost basis.\n\nAs the market bounced back to $66.5k, around 1.0M coins returned to 'in-profit' status. From these two observations, we can determine that:\n\nAround 1.0M BTC have a cost basis between $61.2k and $66.5k.\nAround 1.0M BTC have a cost basis between $66.5k and the ATH at $73.2k.\n\nThis is one of the larger 'supply clusters' encountered during pullbacks since the 2022 lows, suggesting an acceleration of on-chain coin volumes over recent months.\n\n💡\nRelated Dashboard: Several metrics and charts related to the percent of supply in profit/loss can be found in this dashboard.\nLive Chart\nTaking Chips Off the Table\n\nA majority of these 2.0M BTC which now have a cost basis above $61.2k have recently changed hands, with the prior owner spending them to lock in a profit. The chart below presents a suite of variants for the SOPR metric which describes this realized profit behavior.\n\nSOPR describes the average realized profit/loss multiple locked in by the cohort considered, and is the 'spent' sibling of MVRV (which is 'unspent', measuring the average unrealized profit/loss). All four variants have pushed to relative highs, with our Entity-Adjusted variant approaching levels seen at the height of the 2021 bull market.\n\nThis indicates that the market is accelerating their volume and magnitude of profit taking in spot markets.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs the market reached the $73.2k ATH, over $2.6B in Realized profit was locked in via on-chain spending. Approximately 40% of this profit taking can be attributed to the Long-Term, Holder cohort, which includes investors divesting from the GBTC Trust.\n\nThe remaining $1.56B in Realized profit was locked in by Short-Term Holders, as traders take advantage of the inflowing liquidity and market momentum. Realized profit by both cohorts has reached a similar magnitude to during the 2021 bull market peak.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also see the dominance of Long-Term Holders is increasing relative to all profit taking events. This aligns with our prior report (WoC-11) where we noted an uptick in LTH spending as the market broke to new ATHs.\n\nThis behaviour pattern is typical of all prior Bitcoin cycles which we documented in a prior report; Following the Smart Money From this, analysts can start to consider LTHs as an increasingly important cohort when assessing the magnitude of sell-side supply pressure moving forwards.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFinally, we can consult a somewhat attractive chart which plots out supply clusters over time and by coin age. We have highlighted in blue previous breaks to a new ATH price, catalysing a distinct transition towards 'red hot supply'.\n\nThese warmer colors indicate that a large proportion of older supply has started to transact, change hands, and be revalued up to the current spot price. We can see that this tends to characterise the 'Euphoria Phase' of prior Bitcoin bull markets, and thus far very similar patterns are playing out.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that higher prices tend to active more dormant supply, bringing older illiquid supply back into liquid circulation. This reflects a wealth transfer event, where long-term holders distribute supply for a profit, and satisfy the new inflowing waves of demand.\n\nLive Dashboard\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe Bitcoin market has rallied to a new ATH above $73k, triggering an uptick in profit taking events by the Long-Term Holder cohort. The market is currently seeing over $2.6B/day in realized profit, suggesting many investors have started to take chips off the table. This is not atypical market behaviour however, and aligns very closely with market patterns observed during all prior cycle ATH breakouts.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "Ethereum and DeFi\nEthereum's Dencun Upgrade\n\nThe Dencun upgrade has activated successfully, introducing a new architecture for Layer-2 solutions to anchor into the mainchain. It also introduces modifications to the staking pool. Both could impact Ethereum's monetary policy.\n\nGlassnode, Alice Kohn\nMar 19, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe Dencun Upgrade on Ethereum introduces new data storage capacities, aimed at reducing fee costs of its Layer-2 scaling solutions.\nThe upgrade also implements a fixed limit for entering validators to manage the growth of the validator set and maintain efficient node communication.\nThis change could influence Ethereum's monetary policy by reducing the rate of new Ethereum issuance. This could potentially lead to a decrease in the Ethereum supply.\nReducing Costs for Scaling Solutions\n\nOn Wednesday, March 13, Ethereum underwent another major update. The Cancun-Deneb (Dencun) upgrade, which introduced significant changes to Ethereum's rollup infrastructure. The upgrade also implements several modifications to Ethereum's staking pool to improve node communication, and network stability.\n\nOver the recent years, various solutions have emerged to help the Ethereum network process more transactions in aggregate. Roll-ups are a blockchain which executes transactions externally to the Ethereum blockchain, utilizing a separate execution environment. They aggregate batches of transactions occurring on the roll-up, and anchor them into a single transaction, which is then submitted to, and verified by the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nRoll-up solutions have gained popularity over the last 2 years, with the two major scaling solutions, Arbitrum and Optimism, seeing usage increase by up to 150k, and 100k daily active addresses, respectively. Meanwhile, Ethereum's mainnet still has the largest activity count, with more than 400k active addresses per day.\n\nThe major feature of the Dencun upgrade is to create additional data storage capacity on the Ethereum network. It introduces a new type of transaction capable of carrying large data packets which are referred to as blobs.\n\nBlobs are temporarily stored on the consensus layer instead of the execution layer, which leads to decreased fee costs for both the Ethereum network, and the roll-ups themselves. As displayed in the table below, transaction costs have decreased significantly after the upgrade, with Optimism and StarkNet even recording fees below 1 cent.\n\nNormalizing into USD allows us to understand how roll-up fees behave differently relative to mainnet fees. Since their inception, roll-ups have offered cheaper and less volatile fees, ranging between $0.10 to $0.30 per transaction for both Arbitrum and Optimism. In contrast, Ethereum mainchain fees range from $2 to $7 over the same period.\n\nDuring high-activity events where there is an influx of demand for Ethereum blockspace, fees can escalate to over $30. Prior to Dencun, fees on roll-ups were somewhat dependant on mainchain fees, and have seen their fees increase up to a maximum of $2.50 during similar situations.\n\nThe co-dependence of roll-up fees on the high volatility of the Ethereum fee market tends to result in more expensive and challenging user experience overall. These layer-2 solutions also impacted the Ethereum fee market by adding a new source of demand for blockspace. According to a report by Fidelity, the transaction fees that the various Layer-2 chains paid, typically account for around 10% of all total fees paid on Ethereum's mainnet.\n\nSource: Fidelity Digital Assets\n\nWith the Dencun upgrade, the separation of Layer-2 anchoring transactions into blobs is largely in line with improving user experience, reducing fees, and aligned with the rollup-centric roadmap of the Ethereum Foundation. The hope is that lower transaction fees will encourage more users to move onto roll-ups, thereby increasing the aggregate Ethereum based transaction throughput. This strategy aims at improving scalability without compromising the decentralization and security of the mainchain.\n\nShortly after the introduction of the first set of scaling solutions for Ethereum, we observed an increase in average transaction throughput in mid-2021 was 105 Transactions per Second (TPS). Of this, roll-ups accounted for around 46 TPS, or 44% of the total.\n\nThis provided an initial indication of success for the roll-up centric roadmap, and similar Layer-2 scaling solutions. However, when compared to Ethereum's biggest competitor, Solana, which averages around 2.6k TPS, there's remains a significant difference, largely a function of the design architectures of Modular (e.g. Ethereum) vs Monolithic (e.g. Solana).\n\nAdjustments to The Staking Pool\n\nThe Dencun upgrade also introduces new technical changes which impact stakers on Ethereum, largely aimed at improving user experience:\n\nPerpetually valid signed exits enhance the user experience for delegated staking participants (such as liquid staking pools). At present, the signing-key required to authorize exit of a user's stake from a staking pool resides with the validator operator. This arrangement makes the stake owner reliant on the goodwill of the validator operator when they want to exit their position. After the Dencun upgrade, validator operators can pre-sign voluntary exits, allowing the stake owner to unilaterally exit their stake.\nIncreasing the attestation window extends the time validators have to vote on a block's correctness from 6.4 minutes to 12.8 minutes. This allows for more attestations to be gathered, which can accelerate the block confirmation process. The attestation count currently stands at approximately 759k attestations per day.\n\nA fixed limit for new validators has also been added, seeking to slow down the growth of validator set. At the moment, the churn limit regulates how many new validators can enter of exit the staking pool each day. This limit increases by one step at defined increments of total active validators.\n\nAfter the Shanghai upgrade, the number of active validators saw a large increase, averaging +1347 new validators per day. However, as the number of validators increased, it was noticed that a side-effect was a slowing down of node communication.\n\nThe Dencun upgrade has now introduced a limit of 8 new validators per ~6.4min epoch in place of the churn limit function.\n\nA slowed growth in the validator set and effective staking balance has a secondary effect on Ethereum's monetary policy. The current rate of ETH issuance is based on the number of active validators, and as fewer can now enter the staking pool, it may slow down the rate of new ETH issuance.\n\nSince the Shanghai Upgrade, the issuance increased from ETH 1183/day to ETH 2554/day as the validator set grew. Whilst early, we have seen issuance rates decrease for the third time shortly after the Dencun upgrade.\n\nA potentially slower issuance may also act as a net decrease for the Ethereum supply, as more ETH is burnt via transaction fees than the amount of new ETH issued. Since the Merge, we have observed a net reduction in the total circulating supply of -410k ETH.\n\nThe combined impact of the Dencun upgrade on the ETH supply remains to be seen as there are now a few changes which impact each other:\n\nLayer-2 anchoring transactions have now moved into the blob data structure, removing around 10% of the fee congestion pressure. This may result in a slight reduction in ETH burned.\nThe reduced fees on Layer-2s may entice more usage of both the Ethereum mainchain and the scaling solutions, which could add to fee pressure.\nThe rate of issuance growth is likely to reduce as fewer new validators are able to enter the staking pool.\n\nThroughout its history, Ethereum has undergone six major updates, not all of which have directly targeted a change to the ETH supply. However, it's apparent from the last four upgrades that the growth of the ETH supply has slowed. After the Merge, it has even turned slightly negative. The chart below shows these different upgrade events alongside the relative change in the circulating supply of ETH.\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nThe Dencun Upgrade introduces significant enhancements to the Ethereum network, by creating additional data storage capacity via blob transactions. This upgrade effectively reducess fee costs for its various scaling solutions, which improves user experience, and potentially increases aggregate transaction throughput by encouraging the use of roll-ups.\n\nThe upgrade could also impact Ethereum's monetary policy by capping new validator entry, which acts to slow the growth of the validator set and, consequently, the rate of new ETH issuance. While reduced issuance suggests a potential decrease in supply, the new blob structure may also lead to fewer transactions on the execution layer, reducing ETH burned, and possibly mitigating the effect of reduced issuance.\n\nAll in all, this development continues Ethereum's trend toward slowing the growth of its supply, and executing on the roll-up-centric roadmap. It can be seen that the last four upgrades resulted in a deceleration and even a slight reduction in the ETH supply since the Merge.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nBitcoin Breaks to New Highs\n\nBitcoin has broken to its fourth cycle all-time-high, rallying above $72k, and pushing sentiment one step closer to Euphoria. The classic wealth transfer from the HODLer cohort to speculators is now well underway, with significant upticks in spot profit taking, and demand for futures leverage.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nMar 12, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBitcoin has broken to a new ATH of $72k relative to the US Dollar, entering price discovery, and pushing investor sentiment closer to Euphoria.\nNumerous metrics indicate a striking similarity to past ATH breaks, where a wealth transfer from old HODLers to new investors and speculators is well underway.\nRealized profit metrics and futures funding rates have also spiked to significantly positive levels, suggesting elevated profit taking and demand for long side leverage.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nEntering The Euphoria Zone\n\nBitcoin has broken to new all-time-highs relative to the USD this week, clearing the $69.2k level, and rallying over $72.3k. If we only consider the major breaks above the prior cycle ATH, this would be the fourth new cycle ATH in history.\n\nIn this edition, we will examine this phase shift into the 'Euphoria Zone' which tends to accompany new ATHs. From an on-chain data perspective, this moment has historically triggered a distinct shift in investor behaviour patterns, particularly in the relative balance between HODLers and the Speculator cohorts.\n\n📊\nNew Dashboard Released: A new dashboard is available exploring a the on-chain market mechanics of a Euphoric Bitcoin Bull Market.\nView Live Dashboard\n\nThe price is not the only metric to have recently reached a new ATH. The Bitcoin Realized Cap, being a measure of the total wealth stored in BTC on-chain, has also marched to set a new high of $504B, adding over $40B in capital inflows since 1-March alone.\n\nThe Realized Cap is currently increasing at a rate of $54B/month, approaching levels last seen during the run-up in early 2021. This highlights just how significant the capital inflows have been for Bitcoin, driven in part by the tremendous success and demand for the new US ETF products.\n\nLive Chart\nA Steady Transfer of Wealth\n\nOne of the classic patterns observed during Bitcoin bull markets is a transfer of wealth from old to young. Investors who accumulated BTC at cheaper prices several months to years in the past, tend to accelerate their distribution pressure as new ATHs are reached (see our prior report).\n\nThis wealth transfer is once again in play, with the proportion of wealth held by 'Young coins' (moved within the last 3-months), increasing by 138% since October 2023. This reflects a net expenditure by longer-term investors who had previously held their coins for at least 3-months.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can see this dynamic play out over prior cycles through the lens of Short-Term and Long-Term Holder Supply. Here we can see that LTH supply has declined by -660k BTC since the peak in Nov 2023. As we covered last week (WoC-10), approximately 57% of this decline can be attributed to redemption from the GBTC ETF product.\n\nConversely, STH Supply has increased by +810k BTC over that same period, absorbing coins from two regions:\n\n660k BTC transferred from Long-Term Holders.\n150k BTC withdrawn from Exchange Balances we monitor.\n\nOverall, this transfer of wealth appears to be following a very similar path to all prior Bitcoin cycles, and represents both a shifting ownership structure, but also the dynamic balance between supply, demand, and price.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs LTHs distribute coins, their sell-side must be absorbed by an influx of new demand. The challenge for analysts is to identify periods when this distribution pressure may be reaching a point of over-saturation and exhaustion of new demand. The chart below shows two traces:\n\n🔵 The percent drawdown of LTH Supply from its peak.\n🔴 The percent uptick of STH supply from its cycle low.\n\nAt previous bull market peaks, LTH supply had declined by between -14%, and up to -25%, suggesting a relative degree of distribution pressure each cycle. Conversely, STH Supply tends to reach a maximum around the cycle top, increasing by more than 83% from its cycle low.\n\nIf we make the overly-simplistic, ballpark-grade assumption that these drawdown/uptick magnitudes reflect a point of supply/demand inflection at cycle peaks, it would indicate that the current market has experienced around 30% of the typical distribution cycle.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe RHODL Ratio is another popular metric for tracking this transfer of wealth from old HODLers to new investors and Speculators. It is constructed as the ratio between wealth stored within in 1-week old vs 1y-2y old coins.\n\nThe chart below has highlighted in 🔵 where the RHODL Ratio crosses above its current value of 6.3k. We can see that this indicator is in a very similar position to all prior ATH breaks, suggesting the transfer of wealth is firmly in line with historical precedents.\n\nLive Chart\n\nBy isolating traces for the wealth stored in each age band component (🔴 1wk and 🔵 1y-2y), we can visualise this transfer of wealth over the course of the cycle.\n\nAt the lows of bear markets, the HODLer cohort holds a dominant proportion of the wealth, with the 1y-2y curve 🔵 reaching its cycle peak.\nAt the tops of bull markets, the Speculator cohort now dominates the supply, with the 1-week curve 🔴 peaking, alongside prices reaching their cyclical top.\n\nOnce again, a market break to new ATHs corresponds with a switching of dominance, where the capital held by new investors and Speculators overtakes that held by longer-term HODLers.\n\nLive Chart\nTaking Profits\n\nThis distribution pressure by Long-Term Holders is of course balanced by an equal magnitude of inflowing demand from the Short-Term Holder cohort (since every seller is matched with a buyer). The revaluation of older coins from a lower cost basis to a higher one necessitates a capital inflow, as the new buyer must acquire those coins at a higher aggregate value.\n\nIntegrate the Profit & Loss Checklist into your trading\nDownload PDF\n\nWe can therefore relate capital inflows to both upticks in the realized cap, but more directly with the Realized Profit metric. This week, the magnitude of Realized profit locked in via on-chain spending reached statistically high levels, trading more than one standard deviation above its long-term mean.\n\nThis also reflects very similar conditions to the start of prior 'Euphoria' phases, such as the 2017 and 2021 bull markets.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn this final chart, we highlight quite an intriguing observation, relating a popular on-chain metric, SOPR, to the funding rates observed in futures markets. The chart below has two traces:\n\n🔵 Entity-Adjusted SOPR (minus 1), reflecting the average profit/loss multiple locked in by economical on-chain spending (filters out internal transfers and similar). Higher values indicate that the average coin being spent are locking increasingly large profit magnitudes on average.\n🟠 Futures Funding Rates (Annualized), which reflects the interest rate paid from longs to shorts (when positive, and vice versa when negative). Funding rates can help measure both the magnitude, and direction of leverage in futures markets, as well as the incentive for market makers to add liquidity to orderbooks to arbitrage the premium (via a cash-and-carry trade).\n\nThe similarity between these traces is quite striking, suggesting they are telling analysts a similar story, but from a different lens. Both metrics have increased to levels coincident with the late-2020 to early-2021 bull market. This indicates that profit taking is elevated, ans so is long biased leverage in futures markets.\n\nMore specifically, the average on-chain spend is locking in a profit of +27%, whilst speculators in futures markets are willing to pay an interest rate in excess of 35% to 45% for access to leverage. Both metrics have reached and persisted at much higher levels in the past, but are certainly now well within 'Euphoria Zone' territory.\n\n⚠️\nImportant Update RE Futures Funding Rate metrics: We are transitioning our funding rate metric in Studio and API to a new weighting methodology. Glassnode members are reminded to please transition all models and API calls which use funding rates to the new Futures Funding Rate Perpetual v2 metric by 22-May-2024. Thank You.\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nBitcoin has broken to its fourth new cycle ATH this week, trading above $72k for the first time. This move is supported by massive capital inflows to the asset, with the Realized Cap climbing at a rate of around $54B/month, in line with the 2021 bull cycle highs.\n\nAcross numerous metrics, the current cycle is surprisingly and eerily similar to previous ATH breaks, with the transfer of wealth from HODLers to new investors and speculators well under way. This dynamic reflects a healthy balance between distribution pressure, and new demand, but also gives us a glimpse into the mechanics which, eventually, go on to establish cyclical tops.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

In this report, we assess how the demand inflows from the US Spot ETFs are interacting with the supply being released by Long-Term Holders taking profits.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nMar 5, 2024 • 6 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBitcoin prices are attacking the ATH once again, taking the market by surprise, and rallying with strength even prior to the widely anticipated halving event.\nWe have seen a sudden spike in the average transaction size interacting with Coinbase, which highlights the size and scale of new institutional capital entering Bitcoin.\nLong-Term Holders have started to ramp up their distribution pressure, hitting spending rates of 257k BTC/month, with GBTC accounting for 57% of these volumes.\n💡\nLive charts are available within The Week On-chain dashboard.\n\nThe opening of 2024 has become one for the Bitcoin history books, with the Bitcoin market rallying towards ATHs, even before the halving event coming in April.\n\nThe chart below shows the rolling performance over Weekly 🟥, Monthly 🟦 and Quarterly 🟧 timeframes, and have hit +20%, +44%, and +55% at the time of writing. If we count the number of trading days over the last quarter where all three performance indicators exceed +20%, we can see that the rally late last week has been the most powerful since the 2021 bull market.\n\nLive Standard Workbench\nSpot ETFs Demand\n\nMany observers anticipated strong demand after the SEC approved Spot ETFs for US markets. At the same time, many were sceptical, and believed that the ETF news was already priced in, and thus expected a sell-the-news correction. With Bitcoin now trading at $68.0k, 58% higher than $42.8k at the time of ETF approvals, the sell-the-news camp have found themselves offside.\n\nTo better gauge the aggregate demand inflows, the chart below presents the weekly average of the USD flows via the following areas:\n\nNetwork Issuance 🟪: The daily network reward to miners (assumed sell side), which has increased from $22M/day in September 2023, to $49M/day today.\nAll Exchanges Netflow 🟧: Focusing on the months leading up to the ETF approval date, centralized exchanges witnessed significant swings between positive (sell-side) and negative (buy-side) waves of capital flows. Since the ETFs started trading, this metric has shown a consistent outflow or buying pressure of up to $246M/day. At the end of last week, the aggregate exchange netflow was experiencing a $17M/day outflow.\nUS Spot ETFs Netflow 🟩: Despite an initial and significant sell-side pressure exerted by existing GBTC holders, the aggregate net flow into US Spot ETFs averaged $299M/day.\n\nOverall, this represents an on-balance, and back of the envelope net capital inflow into Bitcoin of around $267M/day (−49+17+299). This represents a meaningful phase shift in market dynamics and a valid explanation for the market's rebound towards new ATHs.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nWe can also isolate fund flows related to specific exchanges, such as Coinbase, to identify any changes in overall market dynamics. The charts below show the average deposit volume [BTC] flowing into and out of:\n\nAll Exchanges 🟠\nCoinbase 🔵\nBinance 🟡\n\nThe result shows that the average inflow and outflow transactions have reached considerably higher values with respect to Coinbase in particular. The average transaction size peaked at 4.3 BTC/Tx at the time of the ETF approval.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThese values are noteworthy when compared with their historical range, which has been between 0.2 BTC/Tx and 1.0 BTC/Tx since 2019.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nDiamond Hands in Profit\n\nWith the market getting near ATHs, both the unrealized profit held by long-term investors and the magnitude of their distribution pressure have increased accordingly.\n\nOne way to gauge the profitability of the market for any specific cohorts of investors is to leverage their on-chain cost basis (or the average price at which each cohort acquired their coins) and compare it with the spot price.\n\nLong-Term Holders 🔵 = $20.7K\nShort-Term Holders 🔴 = $45.8K\nMarket Realized Price 🟠 = $24.4K\n\nWith price trading at $68k, the long-term holders are, on average, sitting on an unrealized profit of ~228%.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can plot the unrealized profit multiple held by long-term holders using the LTH-MVRV metric, which is a ratio between price and their cost basis. This ratio currently trades at 3.28, which falls between two historically significant threshold levels separating the following phases of a typical cycle.\n\nBottom Discovery 🟩 (LTH-MVRV < 1): means, on average, these investors are at a loss.\nBear-Bull Transition 🟨 (1 < LTH-MVRV < 1.5): means long-term holder profitability is between break-even, and +50% profit.\nEquilibrium 🟧 (1.5 < LTH-MVRV < 3.5): means long-term holders have an average unrealized profit of +50% to +250%.\nEuphoria 🟥 (3.5 < LTH-MVRV): means, on average, long-term investors are in more than +250% profit.\n\nBased on the current value, these investors are approaching their Euphoria state with an elevated incentive to spend and take profits. Historically, this cohort ramps up their spending as new market ATHs are reached, with distribution accelerating until they help form the cycle macro top.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nLong-Term Players in Action\n\nNow that we have established the magnitude of unrealized profit attributed to long-term holders, we must evaluate how these entities are reacting this shift in profitability.\n\nA quick and straightforward method is to look at the Long-Term Holder Supply. As shown below, long-term investors have distributed approximately 480k BTC since December 2023, when LTH-MVRV was still in the Equilibrium phase. This means some of these investors began to spend at +50% to +200% profit on average, even before the ETF launch date.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nTo assess distribution regimes by long-term holders, we consider two pillars: the distribution rate, and the continuation time.\n\nThe following chart displays the monthly change in the long-term holder supply. Zooming in on the last two major market expansions in mid-2019 and early 2021, we can see the distribution rate for LTHs reached peaks of 319k BTC/month and 836k BTC/month, respectively.\n\nThe distribution rate of this cycle has thus far peaked at 257 BTC/month, with outflows from GBTC accounting for approximately 57% of this.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nAs LTH distribution increases, so too does the magnitude of realized profit locked in. To monitor this dynamic, we have measured the proportion of LTH transfer volume in profit/loss relative to their overall balance.\n\nAt the time of writing, this indicator shows that LTHs are realizing profit at rates equal to 0.14% of their aggregate supply daily. This metric is approaching levels coincident with the early Euphoria phase and prior breaks of the market ATH.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nIn the last part of this investigation, we have created a binary indicator which identifies periods when LTH spending is of a magnitude sufficient to deplete their aggregate balance over a sustained 15-day period. This spending represents a release of long-dormant supply back into liquid circulation, which acts as a counterweight, offsetting new demand.\n\nIntegrate the Profit & Loss Checklist into your trading\nDownload PDF\n\nIn the chart below, we have used several threshold values to categorize the spending regimes. Since late January 2024, the market has entered a phase where the binary indicator has flagged long-term holder supply decline for at least 8 of the last 15-days.\n\nIf we study the 2017 and 2021 cycle tops, A similar structure was sustained for between 123, and 225 days. With the current phase having been in this state for 42 days thus far, it may suggest that demand inflows could offset LTH spending for several months ahead, should history be any guide.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nConclusion\n\nOnce again, Bitcoin has surprised investors by rallying to the last ATH before the halving event, being the first such time this has occurred. The new US Spot ETFs have introduced a significant new source of demand into the market, offsetting the daily issuance and recent sell-side pressure deposited to exchanges by some margin.\n\nLong-Term Holders are spinning up their distribution cycle, which is a trend we have seen in all prior cycles as the ATH is challenged. This allows us to compare these new demand vectors via the ETFs, with the distribution pressure from existing holders and explains Bitcoin's meteoric rise back to all-time highs.",

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nSpeculation In Both Directions\n\nThe risk appetite for Bitcoin investors is increasing, with growing signs of speculation appearing across capital flows, exchange activity, derivatives leverage, and even institutional demand.\n\nGlassnode, UkuriaOC\nFeb 27, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBitcoins recovery is near completion as capital continues to pour into the asset class, propelling the Realized Cap to $460B, and only 3% shy of its ATH.\nExchange inflow volumes are near all-time-highs, with Short-Term Holders dominating the flows. This suggests a relatively strong demand for speculation and trading activity.\nOpen interest in both futures and options markets are also near all-time-highs, and directional short-sellers continue to bet against the uptrend, resulting in over $465M in liquidation volume over the last 30-days.\n💡\nLive charts are available within The Week On-chain dashboard.\nCapital Flows\n\nThe Bitcoin price continues consolidating just below $52k, having held onto the majority of its gains since mid-February. Supporting this performance is what appears to be a steady and healthy inflow of capital into the asset, with the Realized Cap climbing by over $30B YTD. This places the total valuation of the Realized Cap at $460B, which is just 3% shy of the previous ATH.\n\n💡\nRelated Report: For a detailed analysis of the Realized Cap as a gauge for capital flows, please see our report on the foundations of this important metric.\nLive Chart\n\nAs a result of this strong performance, the profitability of Bitcoin investors has improved markedly, with the average investor now holding an unrealized profit of +120% per coin.\n\nThe MVRV Ratio allows us to measure this, with values of this magnitude often seen during the early innings of prior bull markets. Around 1126-of-4965 trading days (22.7%) have seen MVRV record a larger unrealized profit. The air above the market is certainly getting thinner, but it is by no means uncharted.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWith the market largely in a state of unrealized profit, it becomes prudent to evaluate how participants have responded. For this, we can employ a suite of SOPR metrics, which assess the average magnitude of realized profit or loss by cohort.\n\n🟠 Market Average SOPR: 1.13 (+13% profit)\n\n🔵 Long-Term Holder-SOPR: 2.07 (+107% profit)\n\n🔴 Short-Term Holder-SOPR: 1.02 (+2% profit)\n\nAll cohorts are currently locking in meaningful realizing profits, which is typical of an uptrending market (highlighted in 🟧). We have also flagged periods of time where all three SOPR variants exceed their current value in the past (in 🟥). We can see these align with the most euphoric phase of the 2017 and 2021 bull markets, a similar observation to MVRV above.\n\nLive Workbench\nExchanges\n\nWith market momentum intensifying, and investors holding their largest unrealized gains since the Nov 2022 ATH, we can turn to inflows into the major exchanges as a measure for trading activity and speculation.\n\nThe total volume of deposits and withdrawals has continued to expand, reaching a staggering $5.57B in daily volume flowing in and out of exchanges, rivalling activity seen during the Nov 2022 market ATH.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can increase the granularity of the above observation by segrating inflows to Exchanges by on-chain cohorts, allowing us to characterize the source of the deposits. The breakdown of total exchange deposit volume is as follows:\n\n🔴 Short-Term Holders +$2.1B\n\n🔵 Long-Term Holders +$120M\n\n🟢 Inter Exchange Volume +$354M\n\nThe STH Cohort have consistently deposited over $2B per day in volume since mid-January, whilst also setting a new ATH of $2.46B in volume deposited overall. This underscores a high degree of speculative interest within the current market structure.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nFurther confluence can be found by evaluating the percentage of the overall STH balance sent to exchanges. Since Oct 2023, the STH cohort have been depositing upwards of 1% of their supply per day, peaking at a value 2.36% during the recent ETF led speculation. This is largest relative deposit since the March 2020 sell-off.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe degree of speculation within the current market can also be seen by the extraordinarily high dominance of exchanges related in/outflows with respect to all on-chain volume. Currently, 78.3% of all economical on-chain volume is being directed to/from exchanges, which is coming off a new ATH.\n\nNote, economical volume is defined as our entity-adjusted on-chain volume, which filters out internal transfers, wallet management, and self-spends to our best estimate.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe new spot Bitcoin ETF products have also created a new source of demand for BTC, with an incredible +90K BTC in net flows migrating into the ETFs. These inflows account for a staggering $5.7B, and bring the total AUM of the ETFs to nearly $38B.\n\nThese ETF products have for the first time allowed institutional investors to gain exposure to the BTC asset via traditional rails, opening a new degree of freedom for demand and speculation.\n\nLive Chart\nDerivatives Overview\n\nAlongside the uptick in speculation visible in on-chain flows, we can also see that derivative markets have responded similarly. The total Open Interest in futures markets has risen to a value of $21B, with only 84-of-1195 trading days (7%) recording a higher value.\n\nThe USD denominated value of open futures contracts is approaching the highs seen during the most euphoric periods of 2021.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOptions markets have also experienced significant growth, with open interest hitting $17.5B. This is on a comparative footing to the $21B in futures markets, which is a relatively new development since 2023.\n\nThe growth in options markets suggests that Bitcoin derivative markets are becoming increasingly mature, with investors, traders, and miners now having deeper and more liquid options to hedge and manage risk.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe decisive breakout through $30k in October last year was a key point of interest, with notable changes across many parts of the Bitcoin market.\n\nPrior to this rally, the yield available via a cash-and-carry strategy in futures markets was barely above 3% on a sustained basis, being less than the risk free rate available in US treasuries. Since then however, cash-and-carry yields have increased to 14.7%, providing a few indications:\n\nTraders are willing to pay much higher interest rates to take on leveraged long positions.\nThe short-side is now able to capture 2x-3x the ‘risk-free’ rate available in short term US Treasuries.\nThe yield available in futures markets is likely to start attracting market makers back into the digital asset space, deepening market liquidity.\nLive Workbench\n\nThe spread between BTC and ETH funding rates is also is widening. Prior to October-2023, a relatively neutral regime can be observed, where the spread oscillated between positive and negative state.\n\nHowever, since the October rally, funding rates for ETH have been consistently higher than for BTC, inferring an increased appetite by traders to speculate further out on the risk curve.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe have also seen a regime of heavy short liquidation dominance during the rallies into ETF approvals. Whilst market neutral cash-and-carry traders are being attracted to the short-side, the market is still seeing directional short-sellers being liquidated at a higher rate than longs.\n\nIt is worth noting that at both ATH peaks in 2021, long traders dominated liquidation volumes, as leveraged positions were force closed within the intra-day volatility. As such, seeing such a strong dominance of directional short traders being liquidated suggests many traders have been betting against the prevailing uptrend since October.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis has led to a substantial growth in the the total short-side liquidations over the last 30-days, with over $465M in closed positions. The chart below highlights periods where short liquidations exceed those of longs, many of which align with powerful uptrends fuelled by short-squeezes.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nIn lieu of the highest spot prices since Dec-2021, risk appetite amongst market participants has returned in style. This is highlighted by an acceleration of capital inflows, and a increasing activity amongst the Short-Term Holder cohort, whom are depositing over $2B of volume to exchanges per day.\n\nSpeculation activity is also present across derivative instruments, with both options and futures open interest being just shy of ATHs. With perpetual funding rates now providing yields in excess of 2x to 3x the risk free rate of US treasuries, there has been an uplift in liquidity and short-side interest. However, much of this appears to be directional, as many traders continue to bet against the prevailing uptrend (being liquidated as a result).",

In this piece, we explore how capital starts to rotate through assets, by tracking asset performance, TVL, and trade volumes on DEXs.\n\nGlassnode, Alice Kohn\nFeb 20, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nSince October last year, our Altseason Momentum Indicator has flagged a growing appetite from investors to move capital further out on the risk curve.\nWhilst Bitcoin dominance remains significant, there are early signs of more capital rotation into the Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, and Cosmos ecosystems.\nBy investigating Uniswap liquidity pools, we can see that most capital remains in the most mature assets, and whilst TVL is moving out on the risk curve, trade volume has been slower to follow.\nAnticipating Altseason\n\nWith the new spot Bitcoin ETFs gaining momentum, a bull market in the digital asset space is arguably in play. With this backdrop, we will continue exploring the question of capital rotation into altcoins we covered in WoC 04. In this edition, we will focus on how assets are performing further out on the the risk curve.\n\nThe goal is to assess how capital rotates and flows into the altcoin markets. We will again consult our Altseason Indicator as a macro indicator (see WoC-41-2023). This indicator assesses whether positive momentum is building within the Total Altcoin Cap, alongside continuous capital inflows into BTC, ETH, and Stablecoins.\n\nOur Altcoin Indicator has signalled positive momentum since October last year, with a brief pause during the sell-the-news event after the Bitcoin-ETFs went live. It re-triggered on the 4-Feb.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn terms of market cap dominance, Bitcoin continues to lead with over 52% market share of the total digital asset market cap. In contrast, ETH accounts for 17%, stablecoins 7%, and 24% by the remainder of the Altcoin sector.\n\nIn terms of asset performance, BTC and ETH are leading the pack, with YTD gains of +17.6% and +18.2%, respectively. We note that following the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, ETH has started to outperform BTC, which is a change from the relative underperformance throughout 2023.\n\nOn the other hand, the aggregate Altcoin market cap has not experienced the same performance, with YTD growth being less than half of the two majors.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAnother lens to track performance is using the Realized Cap for each sector, which aggregates the cost basis value of all coins transferred on-chain. From this perspective we can better assess the movement of capital within digital asset markets:\n\nBitcoin is again clearly leading, seeing almost $20B in capital inflows per month at present.\nEthereum inflows tend to lag relative to Bitcoin, suggesting investors look for confidence and confirmation that digital asset markets are growing. In the 2021 cycle, the peak influx of new capital into BTC occurred 20 days before the peak influx into ETH.\nAltcoins tend to see capital flows with a similar lag after ETH sees strength, with a duration of 46 days in mid-2021, and 14 days in late-2021.\n\nIt is evident that capital moves down the risk curve into Altcoins at a slower pace compared to the rotation between the two major cryptocurrencies, a trend which appears to be in play once again.\n\nSector Rotation\n\nWith signs of capital flows into the two majors, the next question is to observe how it flows further out on the risk curve over time. Over the course of the last cycle, several new Layer-1 ecosystems have emerged. Many of these compete with ETH for market share, not only in terms of innovation and user attraction, but also in terms of investor capital.\n\nWe therefore examine the top five tokens of some select ecosystems: Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, and Solana, to assess which are attracting the most investor interest.\n\nHere we compare the weekly change in the aggregate market cap of the top five tokens in each ecosystem. Over the past 18-months, Solana has exhibited relatively high volatility, with upside performance being a standout. Polkadot and Cosmos have similar volatility, but with the Polkadot ecosystem outperforming latter.\n\nWithin the Ethereum ecosystem, we can specify three major sectors: DeFi, GameFi, and Staking. Since the beginning of this year, all three sectors have seen inflows, however the DeFi and GameFi sectors have seen relatively large capital outflows throughout 2022 and 2023.\n\nThis year has seen a reversal in the GameFi sector, with notable inflows starting in October, which coincides with the point when our Altcoin Indicator triggered. In contrast, Staking tokens have consistently experienced positive capital inflows, although less in absolute magnitude.\n\nOut on the Risk-Curve\n\nTo determine whether, and to what extent investor interest is shifting out on the risk curve, we can refer to data sourced from Uniswap liquidity pools. Since Altcoins are often traded by more crypto-native traders via decentralized exchanges, activity on the most established DEX can serve as a proxy trends in Altcoin trading (note: this data reflects Uniswap trading on the Ethereum mainnet).\n\nAltcoin trading interest was very low during the 2022 bear market, but has started to increase in mid 2023, driven largely by a bust of 'Meme-Coin mania'. Currently, Altcoin trading accounts for nearly 12% of Uniswap trade volume, approaching the 17.4% peak seen during the last bull run. In comparison, trading for WBTC and WETH makes up 47% and Stablecoins 40% of trade volume.\n\nLiquidity Providers on Uniswap tend to closely monitor the markets, and changes in the distribution of liquidity across pools can provide an indication for prevailing market trends. By examining the composition of the Total Value Locked (TVL) on Uniswap, we observe that during Altcoin Season, there is increased liquidity profile for tokens outside the Top 50. This trend is indicative of growing investor interest in long-tail tokens.\n\nDuring bear markets, liquidity is predominantly provided for the Top 50 tokens, as this is where the majority of trade volume occurs. The Top 10 tokens are mainly comprised of WETH, WBTC, and Stablecoins.\n\nBy looking at the percent change in TVL for each token category, we can detect an increase in liquidity provided for the Top 10 (5.14%) and Top 20 (10.9%) tokens, whilst liquidity has been removed for tokens ranked ranked 20 to 50. This suggests that the market appetite for long-tail assets has not yet picked up meaningfully.\n\nWe will now examine the pools for the top token in each Ethereum sector. This includes assessing the distribution of liquidity across various price ranges, and observing the evolution of market depth (similar to our hypothesis established in WoC 36).\n\nThe distribution between Altcoin and WETH reserve is well-balanced, with a slightly higher expected upside volatility accross the board. This indicates a generally bullish outlook from Liquidity Providers for these tokens. The exception is the GameFi token IMX.\n\nWhen observing the rate of change in liquidity distribution, we see an increase in market depth for the -5% and +5% ranges, suggesting that Liquidity Providers are preparing for a period of elevated price volatility.\n\nAn exception to this is UNI, where Market Makers have increasingly concentrated liquidity closer to the current price range. This suggests less price volatility is expected for the UNI token, which is not surprising given it is one of the most established and mature tokens.\n\nWe now contrast this with the behavior of traders, where we can observe an increase in trading volume on Uniswap since October 2023, including tokens outside the Top 10. Trading activity is also rising for the Top 10 to 20 token pairs.\n\nHowever, trading activity for the Top 20-50 token pairs and those ranked 50+ remains unchanged, which reaffirms our previous hypothesis: While liquidity provision is moving further out on the risk curve, trade volume has yet to follow.\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nThe market momentum following the new Bitcoin ETFs, and the anticipation of a bull market in digital assets is starting to create shifts in capital flows towards Altcoins. Our Altcoin Indicator suggests a more mature and possibly sustained uptick in Altcoin markets, however it remains relatively concentrated in higher market cap assets at this time.\n\nThe digital asset landscape has evolved significantly over the last cycle, with new ecosystems emerging to challenge Ethereum's dominance. Solana has seen the strongest returns over the last year, however some movement is starting within the Polkadot and Cosmos ecosystems also. Within the Ethereum ecosystem, the Staking sector is showing the most consistent capital inflow for its top tokens.\n\nA resurgence in Altcoin trading on Uniswap, alongside liquidity and trading volume patterns, underscores a cautious yet growing interest in longer-tail assets. This is initially showing up in changing liquidity provision, and an expectation of heightened volatility. This however is particularly present TVL within the pools, and investor trade volume has yet to follow.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nApproaching Supply Discovery\n\nBitcoin investors have been rewarded for their patience and conviction, with BTC prices rallying to multi-year highs above $50k. The volume of supply held at a loss is also thinning quickly, with just 13% falling into this category.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nFeb 13, 2024 • 6 min read\nExecutive Summary\nLong-Term Holders have spend approximately 300k BTC since their supply peaked in Nov 2023. Just over half of these reflect GBTC outflow volumes.\nWith the market trading at multi-year highs above $50k, the volume of supply held in loss is thinning out, reaching just 13% of the global total.\nThe ETF sell-the-news correction in Jan-Feb has many characteristics of a classic 'bull market correction' through the lens of Short-Term Holders.\n💡\nView all charts in this edition in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nThinning Supply\n\nBitcoin investors continue to enjoy a positive and strong year, with BTC market trading to new multi-year highs of $50.2k, and putting the YTD return at +18.5%. Only 141-days during 2021 have seen a daily closing price higher than $50.2k, representing just 2.84% of Bitcoin trading history.\n\nBitcoin is also up +130% over the last 12-months, and over +207% since the Nov 2022 lows, and is now trading just -28.6% below its ATH. With the market getting ever closer to the 2021 highs, the BTC supply which has a cost above this level is getting thinner and thinner.\n\nThis puts a super-majority of investors, and their held supply into profit, edging the market closer to yet another transitional phase, where Long-Term Holders start to take chips off the table.\n\nThe market saw a meaningful uptick in speculation in the lead up to the spot ETF approvals in January. In response, many Long-Term Holders (LTH) transacted their coins, whether to take profits, or perhaps to re-balanced their holdings into one of the new ETF products.\n\nIntegrate the Supply Dynamics Checklist into your trading\nDownload PDF\n\nIn total, LTH Supply balance has decreased by approximately 299.5k BTC since the metric peaked in November last year (at 14.996M BTC).\n\nHowever, we must also consider the GBTC product, which saw over 661k BTC flow in during 2021, classifying its held supply as 'Long-Term Holder' status. Given GBTC has experienced around 151.5k BTC worth of outflows, this indicates that the remaining 148k BTC worth of LTH Supply can be attributed to LTH investors spending their coins. This aligns with our prior research showing that LTHs tend to commence distribution as the market approaches the ATH price.\n\nLive Chart\nSupply Discovery\n\nAs the market marches higher, a super majority of BTC has now moved into a profitable state. In fact, only 13% of the total supply were acquired above $48k and are therefore held in a state of loss.\n\nThe chart below presents a breakdown of the BTC supply by the cost basis at which it was acquired. We can see that the vast majority of coins (87%) were acquired below $48k, with a very large cluster of Short-Term Holder supply located between $40k and $45k. Long-Term Holders dominate this 13% of supply held in loss, reflecting 'top buyers' from the aformentioned 141 trading days in 2021.\n\nGN Engine Room\n\nWe can see that the total volume of LTH Supply held in loss is currently 777.8k BTC, and is trending towards the zero bound as prices rise. Just 6.5% of the aggregate LTH supply is therefore held in loss.\n\nPrevious instances where the LTH cohort held a similar coin volume in loss corresponds with early bull market conditions (with 2019 as an arguable outlier).\n\nLive Chart\n\nAnother way to visualise this is via the proportion of all supply held by LTHs in loss. At the bottom of bear markets, LTHs tend to carry the majority of unrealized losses, as speculators are flushed from the market, and the final capitulation results in a major transfer of coin ownership to high conviction holders.\n\nBy contrast, during the early phases of a bull market, this metric tends to reach consistently lower lows as the rising market rises and puts all LTH supply into profit. This metric appears to be following a similar pattern thus far, briefly falling below 60% during the recent correction to $38k.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: The Percent Supply in Profit/Loss dashboard contains several metrics for tracking market profitability.\nLive Chart\nShort-Term Reset\n\nFor the Short-Term Holder (STH) cohort, the 'sell-the-news' correction after the ETFs launched has resulted in a healthy reset of several metrics.\n\nFirst, we can see that the percent of STH supply in profit fell from its peak at ~100%, to retest its all-time-average of 57.5%. This means that almost half of all STH supply experienced prices falling below their acquisition price, making for a healthy correction. Historically, this tends to correlate with local lows being established when the market is within a macro scale uptrend.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also see this within the next chart, which presents STH Supply broken into the volume held in profit (orange) vs loss (red). This helps us visualise and distinguish periods of heightened risk, from the more 'garden variety' corrections and pull-backs.\n\nTypical Correction Conditions - When STH Supply in Loss increases, but does not exceed ~60% of their holdings. This suggests some portion of new investors are trapped with an unfavourable cost basis, but they are balanced by many who acquired and still hold coins from lower prices.\nHigh Risk Conditions - When STH Supply in Loss increases dramatically, often to a super-majority of their total, it suggests a 'top-heavy' market. Many investors are now trapped with an unfavourable acquisition price.\n\nBy this metric, the ETF 'sell-the-news' correction appears to have more characteristics aligned with a 'garden variety' correction.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFinally, if we take a ratio between STH Supply in Profit/Loss, we can again identify a near text-book retest of the break-even level of 1 (50:50 Profit/Loss split). During robust and resilient uptrends, these points of balanced STH supply profitability tend to form support.\n\nAnalysts can keep an eye on any deep breaks below this level, and in particular points where it flips to resistance, suggesting higher risk conditions are in play.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nLong-Term Bitcoin investors have been rewarded for their patience and conviction, with both 2023, and the year to date thus far being remarkably positive. Whilst BTC prices are still 28% below their ATH, the amount of supply held at a loss is thinning quickly, with just 13% falling into this category.\n\nIf we account for GBTC behaviour, Long-Term Holders have transacted around 148k BTC since November last year. This potentially alludes to a transition in investor behaviour, as some coins are spent and profit taking starts to ramp up.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

We will explore this concept through the lens of four on-chain analysis categories:\n\n🟢 On-chain Activity: Using network activity and adoption to identify periods of growth and user-base expansion.\n🔵 Market Profitability: Identifying periods where the unrealized profit held by investors is improving.\n🔴 Spending Behavior: Spotting periods when there is a sufficient inflow of demand to absorb profit taking by existing holders.\n🟠 Wealth Distribution: Considering the balance and transfer of wealth between old and new holders.\n\nWhilst each indicator can be considered individually, we will also construct a composite index as shown below to assess the strength and direction of market momentum.\n\n💡\nAll metrics included in this article are available to view in our latest Market Momentum Dashboard.\nLive Workbench\n\nThroughout this article we will also demonstrate a variety of techniques for parsing and normalizing on-chain data which can be instructive for analysts.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: A dashboard of example on-chain methodologies that are used regularly by the Glassnode analyst team is available in this dashboard.\nOn-chain Activity and Adoption\n\nIncreasing usage of the Bitcoin network is a typical characteristic during periods of growth, where the user-base expands, network activity increases, and price tends to appreciate. As such, we can identify periods of positive momentum via metrics describing an uptick in on-chain activity.\n\nRising Fee Pressure\n\nThe first example utilizes on-chain fee revenue as a proxy for blockspace demand. Fee pressure will increase when users are expressing heightened urgency and a willingness to pay elevated fees for inclusion in the next block.\n\nIn this instance, we have applied a 2-Year rolling Z-Score to the proportion of miner revenue earned from fees. This metric selection and Z-score transformation achieves two goals:\n\nStandardizes the data set across cycles.\nSpots inflection points relative to the last 2yr half-cycle (e.g. an uptick in fees relative to a waning bear market, or a decline in fees after a cycle peak).\n💡\nMiner Revenue Momentum: \n- Base Metric: Miner Revenue From Fees\n- Transformation: 2yr Rolling Z-Score\n- 🟩 Positive Momentum: Z-Score > 0\nLive Workbench\nExchange Inflow Volume Momentum\n\nIt is also typical for exchange related volumes and trading activity to climb during periods of network growth. Here we consider Exchange Inflow Volumes as it benefits from Glassnode’s entity-adjustment heuristics, and is a more direct proxy for spot trading activity.\n\nWe will use a simple fast/slow moving average cross-over transformation for this metric, seeking periods where the 30D-SMA is above the 365D-SMA. This indicates that near term activity is higher than the slower long-term baseline.\n\nAnalysts may also consider the magnitude of the deviation between these moving averages, as well as their gradient for identifying more advanced indications and divergences.\n\n💡\nExchange Inflow Momentum:\n- Base Metric: Exchange Inflow Volume [USD]\n- Transformation: 30D-SMA and 365D-SMA cross-over\n- 🟩 Positive Momentum: 30D-SMA > 365D-SMA\nLive Workbench\nUnrealized Profit and Pricing\n\nA primary advantage of on-chain analysis is the ability to monitor the cost basis of each coin considering the pricestamp at which it last transacted. We can use this toolkit of Unrealized Profit/Loss to identify price zones where a large volume of the supply has changed hands.\n\nSupply in Profit Trend\n\nDuring sustained market uptrends, the spot price continues to climb above the cost basis of increasing volumes of the coin supply (putting that supply ‘in-profit’). To smooth out daily fluctuations, we have applied a 90D-EMA to the total Supply in Profit [BTC] metric.\n\nWe can then identify periods of positive momentum as those where the 90D-EMA of Supply in Profit is increasing. Here we use a 30-day difference function and display it as a 🔵 oscillator. Positive values signify that the total supply in profit has increased over the last 30-days.\n\nMore advanced analysis can consider the magnitude and divergences of this oscillator, especially as it relates to cycle extremes (100% of supply in profit at ATHs, and when large volumes change hands near cycle lows).\n\n💡\nSupply in Profit Momentum: \n- Base Metric: Supply in Profit [BTC]\n- Transformation: 30-day Difference of Supply in Profit (90D-EMA)\n- 🟩 Positive Momentum: Supply In Profit (90D-EMA) increases over last 30-days.\nLive Workbench\nMVRV and AVIV Inflection Points\n\nAnother powerful tool to monitor inflection points in investor profitability is the MVRV Ratio. In our prior report, Mastering the MVRV Ratio, we established an indicator for tracking market momentum based on a 365D-SMA cross-over methodology.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nMore recently, we developed the AVIV Ratio alongside ARK Invest as part of the Cointime Economics framework. We consider AVIV to be a more representative unrealized profit/loss oscillator for active investors. From this, we can identify market inflection points:\n\nPositive Momentum: AVIV crosses above its 365D-SMA as investor profitability improves, often indicating many investors hold coins with a now favourable cost basis.\nNegative Momentum: AVIV crosses below its 365D-SMA as investor profitability worsens, often indicating many investors are trapped with an elevated and underwater cost basis.\n💡\nMVRV or AVIV Momentum: \n- Base Metric: MVRV or AVIV Ratio\n- Transformation: 365D-SMA\n- 🟩 Positive Momentum: MVRV or AVIV Ratio > 365D-SMA\nLive Workbench\nShort-Term Holders In Profit\n\nWe can also leverage the Short-Term Holder MVRV to specifically track the unrealized profit or loss of new demand entering the market. Comparing the STH cost-basis to the spot price provides insight into the degree of pressure new market participants are experiencing to either capitulate at a loss, or to take profit.\n\nA very simple momentum indicator can be achieved by tracking periods where STH-MVRV trades above or below 1.0.\n\nThis particular variant will be quite responsive (relative to MVRV and AVIV) as it only considers coins moved within the last 155-days. As such, it is quite sensitive to periods when lots of coins have recently changed hands within a specific price range. As price trades away from that cluster, it dramatically changes the unrealized profit/loss position of STHs.\n\n💡\nSTH-MVRV Momentum: \n- Base Metric: Short-Term Holder MVRV Ratio\n- Transformation: 365D-SMA\n- 🟩 Positive Momentum: STH-MVRV > 365D-SMA\nLive Workbench\nRealized Profit/Loss and Spending Activity\n\nIn the previous section, we assessed the unrealized profit/loss incentives which drive market participants to make decisions. These observations are well paired with metrics that describe whether investors actually take action in response to these incentives.\n\nThus, the next logical step is to evaluate the realized market response to these pressures.\n\nSOPR Momentum\n\nThe first metric we consider is the SOPR indicator, which assesses the average magnitude of participant profit and loss taking events on any given day. The objective is to identify periods when profit taking is increasing relative to a longer term baseline.\n\nTo achieve this, we again utilize a fast/slow momentum cross-over strategy applied to the SOPR metric. We will also employ our Entity-Adjusted SOPR variant to ensure we capture only economically meaningful transactions, and exclude internal transactions and self-spends.\n\n💡\nSOPR Momentum:\n- Base Metric: Entity-Adjusted SOPR\n- Transformation: 30D-SMA and 365D-SMA\n- 🟩 Positive Momentum: 30D-SMA > 365D-SMA\nLive Workbench\n\nThe second metric to consider is the ratio between Realized Profit and Realized Loss. This tools is particularly sensitive during regime shifts such as:\n\nDuring strong uptrends there are relatively few coins in loss. However this changes rapidly during corrections, as recent buyers panic and spend previously profitable coins in loss.\nNear bear cycle lows, many investors capitulate at steep losses, and there are relatively few coins in profit. As the market starts to recover, there is a dramatic uptick in realized profit relative to the preceding bearish trend.\n\nWe will again employ a momentum cross-over methodology to highlight periods where the Profit/Loss Ratio is experiencing rapid acceleration in either direction. This aides in identification of trend inflection points.\n\n💡\nRealized Profit/Loss Ratio Momentum:\n- Base Metrics: Ratio between Realized Profit and Realized Loss (Entity-Adjusted)\n- Transformation: 30D-SMA and 365D-SMA\n- 🟩 Positive Momentum: 30D-SMA > 365D-SMA\nLive Workbench\nWealth Transfer\nSLRV Ribbon Momentum\n\nThe final charactestric we shall discuss is the transfer of wealth from longer-term investors, to newer and often less experienced investors. Typically, cycle bottoms are distinguished by a disproportionate amount of wealth held by Long-Term Holders. Conversely, cycle tops are often punctuated by a significant saturation by Short-Term Holders.\n\nThe balance of wealth held between these two cohorts can then be used to provide insight into the position of the current cycle.\n\nTo model this phenomena, we shall utilize the SLVR metric, which compares the wealth held by coins aged 24hrs to coins aged 6m-1y. A momentum cross-over of 30days to 150days is used, as originally proposed by the metric author Capriole Investments.\n\n💡\nSLRV Ribbons Momentum:\n- Base Metrics: Ratio between 24h realized HODL wave and the 6m-1y realized HODL wave (SLRV)\n- Transformation: 30D-SMA and 150D-SMA\n- 🟩 Positive Momentum: 30D-SMA > 150D-SMA\nLive Workbench\nConstructing a Composite Momentum Indicator\n\nFinally, a composite index of several of the aforementioned conditions can be constructed to produce a holistic model. The goal is to assess confluence across various categories; Profitability, Spending Behavior, On-chain Activity and the Transfer of Wealth.\n\nHere we have weighted each individual component evenly, and applied a simple condition to flag when 4-of-8 conditions are met in blue. This has historically identified periods when the Bitcoin market is in a sustainable uptrend. We can also flag when all eight conditions are met in purple, indicating periods with extremely strong positive momentum across all categories.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nConversely, a composite index value of less than 4 denotes that on net, the majority of these momentum conditions are negative. This suggests the market is experiencing overall negative momentum, and is typically experienced throughout bear markets, including the initial inflection points.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nOn-chain data provides analysts and investors with a remarkable degree of transparency into the performance, adoption, and investor positioning within digital assets. In this piece, we highlighted several approaches and frameworks for assessing market momentum across various data categories.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nFeatured\nDigesting the GBTC Overhang\n\nThe Bitcoin market continues to show resilience, recovering from the initial sell-the-news drawdown following ETF approvals. In particular, the market is working through the significant supply overhead created by investors rebalancing capital out of the GBTC product since its conversion.\n\nGlassnode, UkuriaOC\nJan 30, 2024 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBitcoin price performance since the 2022 lows shows striking similarity to prior cycles, albeit recovering somewhat slower, but in a more resilient manner.\nDespite a modest uptick in older coin spending following ETF approvals, the majority of long-term Bitcoin investors remain unwilling to part with their coins at current prices.\nNetwork activity remains low in terms of entities, but monetary volume transferred on-chain, and specifically to exchanges remains robust, and resembles prior bull market cycles.\n💡\nLive charts are available within The Week On-chain dashboard.\nCycle Positioning\n\nThe first chart assesses BTC price performance since the previous ATH. In this instance, we consider April 2021 (the Coinbase direct listing) as the ATH for a better read on duration, since we argue that was the peak in terms of investor sentiment (WoC -4-2022).\n\nThe notion of history rhyming rings strikingly true, with the last 3 cycles experiencing eerily similar performance. Our current cycle remains marginally ahead of both the 2016-17 and 2019-20 periods, due in part to an extremely strong year in 2023.\n\n🔴 Cycle 2: 45.7% below ATH\n\n🔵 Cycle 3: 43.6% below ATH\n\n⚫ Current Cycle: 37.3% below ATH\n\nLive Workbench\n\nHowever, a heightened level of resilience can be noted across our current cycle, with corrections from the local high remaining relatively shallow. The largest drawdown thus far has been -20.1% set in August 2023.\n\nThis insight becomes increasingly pronounced when we count the proportion of days which traded at a deeper correction by comparison:\n\n🟠 Genesis to 2011: 164-of-294 days (55.7%)\n\n🔴 2011 to 2013: 352-of-741 days (47.5%)\n\n🔵 2015 to 2017: 222-of-1066 days (20.8%)\n\n🟢 2018 to 2021: 514-of-1056 days (48.7%)\n\nLive Workbench\n\nDespite this resilience, price momentum has been to the downside over recent weeks, as the market digests the new dynamics of the spot ETFs.\n\nHere, we consult two key on-chain levels:\n\n🔴 Short-Term Holder Cost Basis ($38.3k), describing the average acquisition price of new demand.\n🔵 True Market Mean Price ($33.3k), a cost basis model for active investors.\n\nRetests of the STH Cost basis as support are typical during market uptrends, however, a decisive loss of this level would bring the True Market Mean into consideration. The True Market Mean Price is very much a ‘centroid’ of the Bitcoin market, often distinguishing bull markets, from bear markets.\n\nLive Workbench\nRecovery Meets the GBTC Overhang\n\nWe can assess both the severity of capital outflows across cycles, as well as the recovery duration by utilzing the fundamental Realized Cap metric.\n\nThe Realized Cap remains just -5.4% shy of its previous ATH of $467B, and is currently experiencing strong capital inflows. That said, the duration for this recovery to accelerate has been markedly slower than prior cycles, arguably due to the significant supply overhang from challenging trades like the GBTC arbitrage.\n\nThe current cycle has seen the Realized Cap recover at the slowest pace on record\n\n🥇 2012-13 Cycle 0.22% per day\n🥉 2015-16 Cycle: 0.09% per Day\n🥈 2019-20 Cycle: 0.17% per Day\n🐢 2023-24 Cycle: 0.05% per Day\nLive Workbench\n\nThis phenomena can in part be attributed to the significant redemptions taking place from the Grayscale GBTC product. As a closed end trust fund, GBTC amassed an extraordinary 661.7k BTC in early 2021, as traders sought to close the NAV premium arbitrage.\n\nAfter many years of trading at a severe NAV discount (with a very high 2% fee), conversion to a spot ETF has triggered significant a re-balancing event. Around ~115.6k BTC have been redeemed from the GBTC ETF since conversion, creating significant market headwinds.\n\nLive Workbench\nHODLers Won’t Let Up\n\nAmidst strong rallies, sell-the-news events, and dynamic markets, the vast majority of HODLers appear to be calmly riding the market waves. This set of Supply Last Active metrics measure the proportion of the circulating supply which has been held for multi-year time horizons.\n\nWe can see a slight downtick across the 1y and 2y bands specifically, with many, but not all being associated with GBTC. This indicates that a non-trivial volume of older supply has been on the move in recent weeks.\n\nHowever, in absolute magnitude, the vast majority of the BTC holder base remains steadfast, with the percentage of held supply across multiple age bands residing just below ATHs:\n\n🔴 1+ Years Ago: 69.9%\n\n🟠 2+ Years Ago: 56.7%\n\n🟢 3+ Years Ago: 43.8%\n\n🔵 5+ Years Ago: 31.5%\n\nLive Workbench\n\nIn the WoC-46-2023, we introduced and compared several measures of “Stored Supply” and “Active Supply”. At the time, we noted a large divergence was in play between the two, with a significant dominance towards coins being dormant, inactive, and illiquid.\n\nThis year we see the first signs of a potential closing of this divergence, a notable increase across all measures of “Active Supply”. This provides confluence with the aforementioned uptick in older coin spending.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThis has triggered the largest increase in liveliness since the Dec-2022 capitulation event. This again supports the above analysis, denoting an increase in Coinday Destruction as some investors part ways with a portion of their long-held coins.\n\nHowever, when viewed in a macro context, Liveliness remains near multi-year lows, suggesting that the dominant majority of the supply remains tightly held, arguably waiting for higher spot prices, or perhaps increased volatility as a motivator to spend.\n\nLive Workbench\nOn-chain and Exchange Activity\n\nAssessing on-chain activity for Bitcoin can provide great insights into the health, adoption, and growth of the network. However, despite strong price performance, a counter intuitive observation has emerged with the number of Active Entities declining to cycle lows of 219K per day.\n\nAt face value, this might suggest that despite the significant price appreciation, growth in Bitcoin users has not followed suit.\n\nThis is largely a result of the uptick in activity related to Ordinals and Inscriptions, where many participants are re-using Bitcoin addresses, and reducing the number of measured ‘active entities’ (does not double count).\n\n💡\nWe detailed how analysts can better interpret Bitcoin on-chain activity metrics in WoC-28-2023 for further reference.\nLive Chart\n\nTransfer volumes on the other hand remains extremely robust with around $7.7B/day in economic volume processed. This divergence between ‘active entities’, and increasing transfer volumes highlights an elevated presence of large size entities active in the market, with the average Volume per Entity soaring to value of $26.3k/transaction.\n\nThis alludes to a growing presence of institutional investors and capital flows.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nExchanges, remain the primary venue for trading activity, and deposit and withdrawal volumes have experienced a significant expansion, hitting $6.8B/day. Exchange related deposit and withdrawal activity accounts for approximately 88% of all on-chain volume at present.\n\nThe current volume flowing in and out of exchanges rivals peaks set during the 2021 bull market, with only 68 trading days (1.5%) recording a higher value (30D-SMA basis).\n\nThis again underscores an expanding interest in Bitcoin from market participants.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nAlongside increasing exchange flows, a regime of realized profit taking has followed suit. The chart below shows the average profit (or loss) per coin sent exchanges.\n\nAt the height of ETF speculation, this metric reached an average profit of $3.1k, a level reached at the peak of the April 2023 rally. This remains a far-cry from the $10.5k average profit at the zenith of the 2021 bull market, and is starting to cool off meaningfully.\n\nLive Workbench\nConclusion\n\nThe approval of nine spot Bitcoin ETFs is a landmark event for digital assets, with institutional flows now openly gravitating to the asset class. Capital inflows are now accelerating, despite the significant supply overhang as investors rebalance out of the long challenged GBTC ETF product.\n\nExchange flows on-chain have also reached values equivalent to the peak of the 2021 bull market, and the average size of value transferred is highting a growing presence of institutional and large capital investors.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nWho's next?\n\nWith the Bitcoin ETF becoming a classic sell-the-news event, we explore the market's risk appetite for tokens further out on the risk curve. There are some indicators alluding to ETH outperformance, as well as interesting divergences in altcoin price action relative to the majors.\n\nGlassnode, Alice Kohn\nJan 23, 2024 • 7 min read\n\nExecutive Summary\nIn response to the approval of a suite of Bitcoin ETFs, Ether and Altcoins have rallied strongly last week. ETH managed to outperform BTC for the first time since October 2022.\nETH also has seen increased activity in derivatives market, signalling a possible shift in capital flows. Bitcoin remains dominant in open interest and trade volumes, however ETH has regained some ground since the ETF approvals.\nWe also assess the relative performance of Solana, scaling tokens, and various sector indexes relative to BTC and ETH as a gauge for risk appetite in a post-ETF world.\n💡\nLive charts are available within The Week On-chain dashboard.\n\nThe digital asset markets experienced an uptick in speculation leading up to the Bitcoin ETF approvals, with a general sell-the-news event playing out over the following days. As we discussed in our last edition (WoC-03), the market had arguably priced the event to near perfection. Bitcoin prices have since fallen by -18%, dropping as low as $39.5k as of the time of writing.\n\nDespite this correction, investors continue to look ahead, asking the question: Who’s next? Will there be new round of speculation regarding a potential ETH ETF approval? Will Solana continue to outperform ETH and BTC? Or is there now an appetite for risk and smaller market cap tokens?\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nPost ETF Speculation\n\nDigital asset markets have experienced very strong performance since mid-October as ETF speculation and capital rotation narratives dominated.\n\nBitcoin's market cap has increased by +68.8% since BlackRock first filed for their ETF, and the aggregate Altcoin Market Cap followed suit, rising by +68.9%. However, Ethereum has seen more sluggish relative momentum, underperforming the wider altcoin space by -17%.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nZooming out, we can see that Bitcoin has generally been increasingly dominant over the past few years. Since the FTX Collapse in November 2022, BTC has increased its market cap dominance from 38.9% to 49.8%.\n\nOn the other hand, ETH has maintained its market cap dominance, ranging from 18.9% to 18.2%. It is mainly Altcoins that have lost market share in the crypto markets with their market cap dominance dropping from 28.3% to 24.2%, while Stablecoins have also decreased their share from 13.9% to 7.8%.\n\nLive Chart\n\nShortly after the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, several issuers have filed or suggested a willingness to advocate for a spot ETF for Ethereum. Although obtaining approval for an ETH-based ETF might be more challenging due to the SEC possibly considering Ether as more of an investment contract, the markets appeared to express optimism.\n\nETHs prices have surged by over +20% relative to BTC in recent weeks, making for the strongest performance since late 2022 on a quarterly, monthly, and weekly basis.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThis coincides with a small rebound in the market cap dominance of both ETH and Altcoins in general. Compared to Bitcoin, ETH has gained 2.9% in market cap dominance.\n\nLive Chart\n\nConcurrently, the volume of net profits locked in by ETH investors has reached a new multi-year high. While profits taking has increased taken since mid-October, the peak on 13-Jan reached over $900M/day, aligned with investors capitalising on the 'sell-the-news' momentum.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nPositive market sentiment for ETH is supported by another indicator: Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) for short-term token holders. STH-NUPL has crossed above 0.25 for the first time since the Nov-2021 ATH.\n\nThis suggests both a degree of optimistic market sentiment is creeping in for ETH but is also a level where markets tend to take a pause and digest profit taking distribution pressure. Historically, this type of sentiment shift for short-term holders has coincided with local peaks during a macro uptrend.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nDerivatives Shift Focus\n\nGiven Ethereum's recent rally, it's worth examining its derivative markets to assess how leveraged markets are responding. In recent weeks we can see a meaningful uptick in trade volume for both futures and options contracts. Combined, ETH markets experienced a total trade volume of $21.3B/day, surpassing the average volume of 2023 ($13.9B), but it is still far from the typical levels seen in 2021 to 2022.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nWe can also compare the relative scale of ETH derivative markets to BTC, considering the dominance of futures open interest. BTC perpetual swaps accounted for 55% of open interest in Jan-2022, which has since risen to 66.2%.\n\nConversely, ETH open interest dominance decreased from 45% to 33.8% between 2022 and 2024. However, following the ETF approval, ETH regained some market share, with its dominance rebounding to ~40% by this metric.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThere is also a relatively larger funding rate premium for ETH futures, indicative of a relatively higher risk premium compared to Bitcoin. For the past three months, ETH funding rates have surpassed those of BTC, but did not increase meaningfully in recent weeks. This suggests that there is not yet a substantial rise in speculative interest betting on relatively higher price movements for Ether.\n\nInterestingly, when the ETH-BTC funding rate spread spikes above its 1y average, it typically aligns with local peaks for ETH prices.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nETH or Altcoins?\n\nDigital asset markets are extremely competitive, and ETH is not only fighting for capital flows vs Bitcoin, but also relative to other layer 1 blockchain tokens.\n\nSolana (SOL) has been a major stand out in 2023, seeing outstanding price performance last year, despite significant setbacks due to its association with FTX. SOL has gained considerable market share over the last 12-months, with the SOL/BTC ratio fluctuating between 0.0011 and 0.0005 SOL/BTC.\n\nThe SOL/BTC ratio has increased by 290% since October 2023, and significantly outperformed ETH during this period. Interestingly, unlike ETH, SOL's price did not experience any significant upwards revaluation after the BTC ETF approvals.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs stated at the start of this report, the Altcoin market cap has risen by nearly 69% since the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF filing. When we break down the Altcoin market into different sectors, it becomes clear that this trend has a primarily driver associated with tokens related to Ethereum scaling solutions such as OP, ARB, and MATIC.\n\nStaking and GameFi tokens have also outperformed BTC since late last year. The Staking-Token/BTC Ratio rose by 103% in early 2023 but then fell by -65% until finding a bottom in December. Similarly, the GameFi-Token/BTC Ratio increased by +55% in Feb-2023 and has since decreased by -75%.\n\nScaling tokens reached their peak performance later in the year, seeing the Scaling-Token/BTC ratio rise by +95% in Q2 and Q3 2023. It is important to note that the Arbitrum token only launched in March 2023, being a likely trigger point for this outperformance.\n\nAll indexes experienced a slight increase after the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, another indication of some risk appetite as BTC sold off after the news.\n\nLive Chart\n\nHowever in comparison to ETH, Altcoins simply have not held up in recent weeks. ETH outperformed Altcoins generally, gaining +4.2% in global dominance. This makes ETH the biggest winner in the post-ETF approval market movements.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nThe approval of the new Bitcoin ETFs has bcome a classic sell-the-news event, leading to a tumultuous few weeks in the market. ETH has seen a burst of outperformance, emerging as the short-term winner. ETH investors have recorded a multi-year high in net realized profits, suggesting there is some willingness to sell-the-speculation on a potential ETH ETF capital rotation.\n\nSolana has also become a strong competitor in the Layer 1 blockchain competition through 2023, although did not see any appreciable strength in recent weeks. The general Altcoin sector has also gained some momentum from the ETF excitement, with investors starting to front-run another speculative wave on the road ahead.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe End of the Beginning: The SEC Approves Spot Bitcoin ETFs\n\n2024 has opened with a roller-coaster ride for Bitcoin, as ten new spot ETFs begin trading in US markets. The event was historic and chaotic, with BTC prices setting both new multi-year highs, and YTD lows. Bitcoin has welcomed traditional finance into it's world.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJan 16, 2024 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe successful SEC approval of ten new spot BTC ETF products set the scene for a characteristically chaotic week for Bitcoin investors.\nBTC prices set new multi-year highs, followed by YTD lows, as the market sold off -18% over the weekend. This was driven by both derivatives leverage and spot profit taking.\nSeveral indicators reached levels where past cycles found meaningful resistance, and was highlighted by ~75K BTC being spent by Long-Term Holders taking profits.\n💡\nLive charts are available within The Week On-chain dashboard.\n\nIn two short weeks, 2024 has already proven to be a real roller-coaster ride for Bitcoin investors. In what was arguably the most eventful financial product launch in history, the SEC approved ten spot Bitcoin ETF products to trade in US markets.\n\nIn many ways, Bitcoin managed to pull the traditional finance world, and US regulators, into its infamous world of chaos and volatility. The ETF approvals had a false start on 9-January, after the SEC's X-account was compromised, posting a false notice of positive approvals. BTC prices spiked to $47.2k, before quickly selling back down to $44.5k as reality set in.\n\nA second false start occurred on 10-Jan as genuine SEC approval documents leaked from the SEC website before US markets had closed. Eventually, full confirmation was received for approval of all ten ETF products, with trading to commence on 11-Jan.\n\nBTC prices set a new multi-year high in response, reaching just shy of $48.8k. The market then sold off -18% over the weekend, printing new YTD lows of $40.0k whilst traditional markets were closed. Bitcoin once again welcomed Wall Street to its world.\n\nLive Chart\nSpot ETFs Go Live\n\nOver the first two days of trading, combined spot ETF volumes reached $7.823B, and with over $1.4B worth of AUM flowing in. This overwhelms the -$579M of outflows from the now converted GBTC ETF product, as investors reallocated after many years of poor performance during its time as a closed end fund (and with the highest ETF fee of 1.5%, lowered from 2.0%).\n\nLATEST: With two days in the books, the Nine Newborns have taken in +$1.4b in new cash, overwhelming $GBTC's -$579m of outflows for net total of +$819m. $IBIT now leading pack w/ half a bil, Fidelity close second tho. The newborns' $3.6b in trading volume on 500k indiv trades… pic.twitter.com/b7U5DjENaw\n\n— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 13, 2024\n\nDespite these outflows, GBTC remains the ETF gorilla in the room, sporting $4.166B in trade volume over the two trading sessions, accounting for ~57% of the total. It is likely that funds will continue to reshuffle in-and-around GBTC over coming weeks.\n\nSource: James Seyffart (Bloomberg)\n\nThe sheer scale of GBTC relative to other ETF products can be seen in the chart below by bitcointreasuries.net. Despite the GBTC outflows, their enormous holdings of 617,080 BTC dwarf the competition, and the associated liquidity profile remains attractive for any traders and investors sensitive to liquidity and depth.\n\nSource: bitcointreasuries.net\n\nIn total, US spot ETF products now hold a combined 644,860 BTC (~$27.2B) and account for 29.7% of global ETF holdings after just two trading days.\n\nOverall, the trade volumes and AUM make this one of the largest and most significant ETF launches in history, and in many ways marks the end of the beginning of Bitcoin's maturation and growing up phase.\n\nSource: bitcointreasuries.net\nA Sell-the-News Event?\n\nWhether it is the halving, an ETF launch, or just another Thursday, Bitcoin investors love to debate whether the event was priced in, or not. Whilst there was significant volatility along the way, BTC prices remain more or less flat YTD, suggesting this particular event was priced to perfection.\n\nOf course there are key driving factors behind the interim volatility, and both futures and options markets have seen a meaningful uptick in open interest (OI) since mid-October:\n\n🟠 BTC Futures OI increased by $7.0B (+66%), with $1.1B flushed out this week.\n🔵 BTC Options OI increased by $6.6B (+70%), seeing $2.3B closed out by both contract expiration and closed positions this week.\n\nOpen interest for both markets remain near multi-year highs, indicating that leverage is elevated, and is becoming a more dominant force in markets.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe chart below shows an oscillator for the percent change of futures open interest. This tool can be used to spot periods of rapid change in aggregate market leverage.\n\n🔴 High values indicate OI has increased by +2 standard deviations.\n🔵 Low values indicate OI has decreased by -2 standard deviations.\n\nWe can see that there was a significant deleveraging event on 3-January where almost $1.5B of OI was closed out in a single day. Conversely, OI increased significantly between 9 and 11 January as ETF speculation peaked, and prices approached $49k.\n\nThis was greeted by a weekend sell-off back down to $40k, with new owners of ETF shares introduced to Bitcoin's 24/7 trading environment.\n\nLive Chart\n\nPerpetual funding rates have also maintained a strong positive bias, indicating leveraged traders are net long, and paying the short-side annualized yields exceeding +50% at times. We can also see the distinct phase shift which occurred in mid-October, whereby funding rates shifted from a structure of oscillating around neutral, to consistently positive.\n\nFunding rates have cooled off this week, but do remain positive overall.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOptions implied volatility has also reversed since mid-October, spiking higher during the week's chaotic events. Implied volatility has been in a multi-year decline since May 2021, as interest waned during the bear market. It is also noteworthy that options market infrastructure, liquidity and depth has matured significantly in 2023, with open interest now on par with futures markets (see WoC-51-2023).\n\nThis downtrend appears to have reversed in the near-term, with IV more than tripling since the low of ~30% in October, to over 97% this week. With spot ETF products opening new doors for both institutional and retail capital, it is likely the volatility profile of Bitcoin will also start to evolve.\n\nLive Chart\nOld Coins, New Hands\n\nIt is common for holders of long-dormant coins to respond during major market events. This includes periods when the market sets new ATHs, around cycle tops and bottoms, and during large shifts in market structure (e.g. Mt Gox, Halvings, and now the launch of spot ETFs).\n\nThe degree of Unrealized Profit and Loss held by these Long-Term Holders can be measured by LTH-NUPL. This metric reached 0.55 this week, which is meaningfully positive, and puts the average long-term investor at a 55% unrealized profit.\n\nThis is also a level where the Bitcoin bulls have met meaningful resistance in prior cycles.\n\nLive Chart\n\nLong-Term Holder Supply has also come ever-so-slightly off its ATH, declining by ~75k BTC since November as older coins are spent to take profits.\n\nWhilst 75k BTC is a meaningful sum, it should also be viewed within the context of total LTH supply accounting for a whopping 76.3% of the circulating coin supply. The inverse measure, Short-Term Holder supply, is only just ticking up off all-time-lows as this spending takes place (covered in WoC-46-2023).\n\nLive Chart\n\nWith that said, the amount of spending by these older hands is statistically significant, resulting in a +1 standard deviation increase in Revived Supply (spent coins aged 1yr+).\n\nAs we can see in the chart below, such events are relatively infrequent, however often align with up-trending markets meeting meaningful resistance.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs these older coins are spent back into liquid circulation, they contribute to what is now the largest profit taking event since the November 2021 ATH. The Realized Profit peak for this cycle was set on 4-Jan, with over $1.3B/day in profit locked in as coins change hands at a higher cost basis.\n\nProfit taking is par for the course during a market uptrend, and the real question is whether the inflow of new demand will be sufficient to soak it all up.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe last week was historic in both a literal and a figurative sense. The scale of these new spot Bitcoin ETFs set new records, and a decade of hard work by the industry finally reached fruition. After more than a decade of hard work, against a backdrop of significant political, regulatory, and financial headwinds, the spot ETF ball has finally reached the end-zone.\n\nIt is somewhat poetic that this suite of spot Bitcoin ETFs started trading 15-years to the day since Hal Finney first tweeted Running bitcoin on 11-Jan-2009. The first ever Bitcoin transaction between Satoshi and Hal occurred the next day on 12-Jan-2009.\n\nRunning bitcoin\n\n— halfin (@halfin) January 11, 2009\n\nSeveral metrics in both on-chain and derivatives domains suggest that a non-trivial portion of Bitcoin investors did treat this as a sell-the-news event. The key question ahead is whether the inflow of demand from the ETFs, or in anticipation of the halving in April, or by the humble and reliable HODLers, will be sufficient to push through this resistance.\n\nThe ETFs may have been priced in, but for how long?\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\n2023 Yearly On-chain Review\n\nIn this last edition for the year, we will do a whirlwind tour of what changed this year, on-chain. We will explore how the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Derivative, and Stablecoin landscapes have evolved in 2023, and how this sets up the space for an exciting road ahead.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nDec 19, 2023 • 14 min read\nExecutive Summary\n2023 has been an incredible year for digital assets, with Bitcoin up over 172%, correcting less than 20%, and net capital inflows into BTC, ETH and Stablecoins.\nThe market has broken above several important technical and on-chain pricing models this year, with October being a major pivot point for institutional capital flows.\nLong-Term Holders currently hold a near all-time-high of the Bitcoin supply, and a super-majority of coins are now held in profit.\nMajor market structure shifts are taking place, such as Tether re-asserting dominance amongst stablecoins, CME futures flipping Binance, and significant frowth of Options markets.\n📊\nAll charts covered today are available in The Week On-chain dashboard.\n\nIn this last edition for the year, we will do a whirlwind tour of what changed this year, on-chain. We will explore how the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Derivative, and Stablecoin landscapes have evolved in 2023, and how this sets up the space for an exciting road ahead.\n\n2023 has been an exceptional year for digital assets, with Bitcoin's market cap increasing by a peak of +172%. The rest of the digital asset ecosystem has also had a strong year, with Ethereum and the wider altcoin segments seeing +90% growth in their market caps.\n\nThis highlights a rising Bitcoin dominance, which is often seen as the market recovers from protracted bear markets, such as 2021-22. Ethereum in particular has had a somewhat slow start on a relative basis, with the ETH/BTC Ratio declining to multi-year lows at around 0.052, despite a successful shipping of the Shanghai update, and growth of its L2 ecosystem.\n\nWhilst digital assets have significantly out-performed traditional assets like Equities, Bonds, and Precious Metals all year, the rally since late in October has been responsible for the lions share of the gains. This started with a break above the psychologically important price level of $30k, as well as numerous important pricing levels.\n\nLive Chart\nNo Pullbacks Given\n\nOne of the standout features of the 2023 market has been the remarkably shallow depth of all price pullbacks and corrections. Historically, periods of bear market recovery, and bull market uptrends for BTC regularly see at least -25% pullbacks from the local high, with many examples exceeding -50%.\n\nHowever, the deepest correction in 2023 closed just -20% below the local high, suggesting that buy-side support, and the overall supply and demand balance has been favourable all year.\n\nLive Chart\n\nEthereum has also seen relatively shallow corrections, with the deepest reaching -40% in early January. Despite the more sluggish performance relative to BTC, this also paints a constructive backdrop where reduced supply issuance from the Merge, is meeting relatively resilient demand flows.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe 2022 bear market was marginally less brutal than the 2018-20 bear cycle, with most major digital assets starting off 2023 at a -75% drawdown from the ATH. The strong performance since the lows recovering a large percentage of their losses. The major assets are currently trailing their ATHs by -40% (BTC), -55% (ETH), -51% (Altcoin excl ETH and Stablecoins), and Stablecoin supplies (-24%).\n\nLive Chart\n\nFrom an on-chain perspective, the Realized Cap for BTC and ETH provides an excellent tool for tracking the recovery of capital flows into the respective asset. The total Realized Cap drawdown during the 2022 bear reached similar levels to prior cycles, reflecting a net capital outflow of -18% for BTC and -30% for ETH.\n\nCapital inflows have been recovering at a much slower rate however, with the Bitcoin Realized Cap ATerH hit ov 715-days ago. This compares to a full recovery of the Realized Cap taking around ~550-days in prior cycles.\n\n📰\nRelated Report: We explored how investors and traders can use the powerful Realized Cap to track capital flows in our recent report.\nLive Chart\nBreaking Through $30k Resistance\n\nThe Bitcoin market overcame numerous technical and on-chain pricing models this year, all of which help us appreciate just how strong the performance has been.\n\nThe year started out with a short squeeze in January which pushed the market above the Realized Price 🟠, which had effectively capped prices since June 2022. This upswing also broke through the 200D-SMA 🔵, until it meet resistance at the 200W-SMA 🔴 in March.\n\nBitcoin prices proceeded to consolidate between the 200D-SMA 🔵 and the True Market Mean Price 🟢 until the August, leading into one of the least volatile periods in Bitcoin history (see WoC-32 and WoC-33). Shortly after, a swift deleveraging event brought prices from $29k to $26k in a single day, and below both of the aformentioned long-term technical price averages.\n\nIt was the rally in October which really changed the game, recovering through all remaining price models, and breaking through the key psychological $30k level. Bitcoin ha since reached its yearly high of $44.5k, and is consolidating around $42k at the time of writing.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA common thread readers may notice in this article is how capital flows, market momentum, and performance have accelerated since late October. In WoC-49, we explored how this was associated with BTC prices breaking above the $30k level, which we characterise as a transition from the 'uncertain recovery' phase into an 'enthusiastic uptrend'.\n\nNotably, the October rally broke through two important levels which have delineated this transition in prior cycles:\n\nThe technical market mid-point: being a price level broady acting as support during the early bear, and resistance in the late bear. This cycle, $30k was the last major area of support before a series of capitulation sell-offs, culminating with the collapse of FTX.\nThe Cointime True Market Mean Price: which reflects the cost basis of active investors. This model was developed within our Cointime Economics research in collaboration with ARK Invest.\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also see a marked change in character across our Recovering From a Bitcoin Bear Signal, as all eight indicators have entered positive territory since October. Readings were spotty through most of 2023, displaying a very similar character to the 2019-20 period.\n\nWith all eight indicators now firing, this suggests that across several metrics, and areas of Bitcoin market structure, the market has entered positive territory often associated with resilient uptrends.\n\nLive Chart\nUpticks in Volume, Fees, and Inscriptions\n\nSupporting the notion that October was somewhat of a market phase shift, we can see that transaction volumes for Bitcoin were relatively stagnant up until that point. The October rally motivated transfer volumes for Bitcoin to double from $2.4B/day to a over $5.0B/day, the highest levels since June 2022.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also see Exchange inflow and outflow volumes for BTC and ETH picking up throughout the year, suggesting a general expansion in spot trading interest. Of note is how BTC volumes are increasing significantly faster than ETH volumes, aligned with the observation of rising Bitcoin dominance. It is common for BTC to lead investor confidence out of the doldrums following long bear markets, and this chart helps visualise this phenomena.\n\nBitcoin transaction counts reached new all-time-highs this year, largely due to the unexpected rise of Ordinals and Inscriptions. These transactions embed data such as text files and images within the signature portion of a transaction.\n\nAs a result, we can now assess two types of Bitcoin transactions:\n\n🟠 Total Transaction Counts (unfiltered)\n🔵 Monetary Transactions which have reached a new multi-year, and almost all-time highs of 372.5k/day.\n🔴 Inscription Transactions which have added an additional 175k to 356k transactions per day ontop of the classic monetary transactions.\n💡\nFor more information on Inscriptions, please see our dedicated report on the topic, as well as WoC-7, WoC-39 for our assessment of market impacts.\nLive Chart\n\nThe vast majority of inscriptions tend to be text based, and are associated with a novel token standard referred to as BRC-20 🔵. At the peak, the Bitcoin network has seen over 300k inscriptions per day, well and truly eclipsing the peak of 17.2k/day for Image based inscriptions 🟠 in April (images are larger and thus more expensive to inscribe as fees increase).\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs a result of this new buyer of Bitcoin blockspace, miner revenue from fees has increased significantly, with several blocks in 2023 paying fees which even exceeded the 6.25 BTC subsidy. There have been two major fee spikes this year, with fees now accounting for around a quarter of miner revenues. This is on par with the euphoria phases of the 2017 and 2021 bull markets.\n\nLive Chart\n\nInterestingly, whilst Inscriptions account for around 50% of confirmed transactions, they surprisingly only take up around 10% to 15% of blockspace. This is a result of both the small size of text files, and nuances associated with the SegWit data discount (a topic we cover in WoC-39).\n\nLive Chart\n\nInscriptions have contributed between 15% and up to 30% of the total transaction fee revenue for miners this year. This highlights the unintuitive nature of the SegWit discount, where Inscription transactions consume a minority share of blockspace (in bytes), pay a meaningful proportion of fees, but also account for around half of all confirmed transactions.\n\nIn effect, Inscriptions and the SegWit data discount allow miners to fit more transactions, which pay more fees, into the same maximum size block. The impact on miner revenues should demand for Inscriptions persist is likely to improve miner economics meaningfully, especially with the fourth halving fast approaching.\n\nLive Chart\nBridges, Staking, and Shanghai\n\nFor Ethereum, on-chain activity has been a little on the sluggish side this year, with October again being a notable inflection point.\n\nActive Addresses has been relatively flat at around 390k/day\nTransaction counts have recently increased from 970k/day to 1.11M/day\nETH Volume Transferred has increased from $1.8B/day to $2.9B/day\nLive Chart\n\nWhilst the market price of ETH has generally under-performed the wider digital asset space, its ecosystem continues to expand, mature, and grow. In particular, the Total Value Locked into the ever expanding fleet of Layer-2 blockchains has increased by 60%, with over $12B now locked into bridges.\n\nThese L2 chains are seeking to scale and expand Ethereum blockspace, whilst anchoring their data and finality into the Ethereum main-chain to maintain their security.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe other key area of growth for Ethereum has been the total volume of ETH staked via the new Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Staked ETH has seen a 119% increase in volume YTD, reaching over 34.638M ETH now locked into the staking protocol. The Shanghai update was also successfully rolled out in April, allowing stakers to complete withdrawals, and reshuffle their staking providers and setups for the first time since the Beacon chain launched in Dec 2020.\n\n📰\nRelated Reports: We analysed the impact of staking mechanics before and after the Shanghai update in WoC-15, WoC-18, and WoC-27.\nLive Chart\nTaking a Long-Term View\n\nDespite the incredible price performance of Bitcoin, a large portion of BTC remains dormant, and reaching Long-Term Holder status in investor wallets. Out of a total circulating supply of 19.574M BTC, over 14.900M (76.1%) are held off exchanges and have not moved in over 155-days, increasing by 825k BTC YTD. This also puts Short-Term Holder Supply at what is effectively an all-time-low of 2.317M BTC.\n\n💡\nWe explore the growing supply tightness of Bitcoin across several pror reports including WoC-26, WoC-45 and WoC-46.\nLive Chart\n\nAs the market rallies, a super-majority of investor coins have returned to being 'in-profit', whether due to changing hands, or by prices rallying above the cost basis. The chart below shows how the total volume of coins held 'in-loss' has declined to around 1.9M BTC, with most held by Long-Term Holders who bought near the 2021 highs.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe flip side is that Supply held 'in-profit' is now over 90% of the circulating supply, with the October rally being the event making it above the all-time-mean. Given 2023 started out with over 50% of supply being underwater, this is one of the fastest recoveries in history (second to the rally in 2019).\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe chart below visualises the change in percent supply in profit over each calendar year since 2015. Whilst the delineation by year isn't perfect, the classic four year Bitcoin cycle allows us to spot some interesting patterns:\n\n🟠 Bear Floor/Recovery sees the largest increase in supply in profit as coins capitulated near the lows return to profitable territory.\n🔵 Early Bull Market where the general uptrend puts the majority of coins in profit, and rallies to new ATHs.\n🟢 Euphoric Late Bull where the market is at ATHs, resulting in small positive, to negative readings since all coins are already in profit and the market nears exhaustion.\n🔴 Primary Bear following the market peak, as significant volumes of coins fall into loss.\n\nWhilst simple in construction, this framework really highlights the similarities between 2015-16, 2019-20, and the progress of 2023 thus far.\n\nLive Chart\n\nLastly on the topic of investor profitability, 2023 has taken Long-Term Holders, Short-Term Holders, and the average holder from an unprofitable, to a moderately profitable state. The NUPL metric for each cohort is not yet at euphoric highs, but is also comfortably above the respective cohort break-even level.\n\nLive Chart\nMaturing Derivatives Markets\n\nA defining feature of the 2020-23 cycle was the emergence of futures and options markets as the preferred venues for price exposure and liquidity. 2023 has proven to be an important year in this maturation, as Options markets have grown to match and even overtake Futures markets in open interest size.\n\nBoth now boast between $16B and $20B in open contracts, with Deribit continuing to dominate (90%+) the options space. This alludes to a growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, as traders and positions utilize options market to deploy more sophisticated trade, risk management, and hedging strategies.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWithin the futures market there has also been a noteworthy dominance shift, with open interest held at the regulated CME exchange overtaking offshore exchange Binance for the first time in history. Once again, October appears to have been an important moment for this phase shift, alluding to an influx of institutional capital.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFutures trade volume for both BTC and ETH saw an uptick in October, with a combined daily volume of $52B/day. Bitcoin contracts dominate around 67% of the trade volume, compared to 33% associated with Ether contracts.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe cash and carry yield available within futures markets have seen three distinct phases throughout the year which also tells a story about capital flows into the space:\n\nJanuary to August with yields fluctuating around ~5%. This is largely in line with short-term US Treasury yields, and thus is relatively unattractive given the additional risk and complexity of the trade.\nAugust to October with yields under 3% following the sell-off to $26k, and a surprisingly low volatility environment.\nOctober onwards as yields break above 8%. With futures basis now maintaining levels 300bps above US Treasuries, market maker capital now has a meaningful incentive to return to the digital asset space.\nLive Chart\nStablecoins Supplies\n\nA relatively new phenomena the last cycle was the outsized role that stablecoins have played in market structure, becoming the preferred quote currency for traders, and a primary source of market liquidity.\n\nAggregate stablecoin supplies had been in decline since March 2022, falling by -26% from the peak, being a major headwind for market liquidity. This is due to a combination of regulatory pressures (SEC charged BUSD for being a security), capital rotation (preferring US treasuries vs non-interest bearing stablecoins), and waning investor interest in the bear market.\n\nLive Chart\n\nHowever October has been a pivot point, with total stablecoin supplies bottoming at $120B, and supply starting to grow at a rate of up to 3% per month. This is the first expansion in stablecoin supply since March 2022, and a likely sign of returning investor interest.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe relative dominance between various stablecoins has also undergone significant shifts between 2022 and 2023. Previously rising stablecoins like USDC and BUSD have seen their dominance shrink significantly, with BUSD entering redemption only mode, and USDC dominance falling from 37.8% to 19.6% since June 2022.\n\nTether (USDT) has once again asserted itself as the largest stablecoin, with total supply climbing to over $90.6B, and commanding 72.7% of the market share.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFinally, we can compare the 30-day change in the Realized Cap for BTC and ETH to that of the aggregate stablecoin supply. These three metrics help visualise and measure the relative capital flows, and rotation between sectors.\n\nOnce again, October stands out as a key moment where capital inflows into all three assets turning positive, aligning with the market breaking above the key $30k level, institutional interest expanding in derivatives markets, and net capital inflows to the three major digital assets.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\n2023 almost couldn't have been more different to the devastating deleveraging and market downtrend of 2022. Instead, this year brought renewed interest in digital assets, significant out-performance, and new on-chain artefacts in the form of Inscriptions on Bitcoin.\n\nThe Bitcoin supply is currently tightly held by Long-Term Holders, and the majority of investors are now holding profitable coins. With a US based ETF looking increasingly likely in early 2024, and the Bitcoin halving due in April, the stage is set for an exciting year ahead.\n\nFrom the Glassnode team: To all readers of The Week On-chain, and to Glassnode members, we want to thank you all for your support and readership this year.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nRound-Trip\n\nBitcoin performed a round-trip this week, rallying to new yearly highs before selling off back towards its weekly open. After such a powerful 2023 thus far, the rally seems to have met resistance, with several indicators suggesting a degree of near-term exhaustion.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nDec 12, 2023 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe strong Bitcoin uptrend found resistance this week, breaking to a new yearly high of $44.5k before experiencing the third sharpest selling off of 2023.\nSeveral on-chain pricing models suggest that 'fair value' based on investor cost basis and network throughput are lagging, hovering between $30k and $36k.\nIn response to strong price appreciation over recent months, Bitcoin Short-Term Holders have taken profits at a statistically meaningful magnitude, pausing the climb.\n📊\nView all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nThe Bitcoin market has performed a round-trip this week, opening at $40.2k, rallying to a new yearly high of $44.6k, before selling off sharply to $40.2k late on Sunday evening. The upside move into the yearly high consisted of two rallies over +5.0%/day (+1 standard deviation moves). The sell-off was equally as powerful, dropping by over $2.5k (-5.75%) making for the third largest one-day down move for 2023.\n\nAs we covered last week (WoC 49), Bitcoin has had a standout year, up over 150% YTD at the peak, and outperforming a majority of other assets. With this in mind, it is important to keep an eye on how investors are responding to their new paper gains as the year approaches the close.\n\nLive Standard Workbench\nNavigating Cycles via On-chain Pricing Models\n\nA useful toolset for navigating market cycles are investor cost basis, measured from the on-chain transactions for various cohorts. The first cost basis model metric we will consider is the Active Investor Realized Price 🟠, which computes a Fair Value of Bitcoin based on our Cointime Economics framework.\n\nThis model applies a weighting factor to the realized price in line with the degree of supply tightness (HODLing) across the network. Large-scale HODLing acts to constrain supply, increasing the estimated 'fair value', and vice-versa. The chart below highlights periods where the spot price trades above the classic Realized Price 🔵 (a floor model), but below the cycle all-time-high. From this we have a few observations:\n\nThe time between a successful break of the Realized Price and making a new ATH has historically been 14 to 20 months (with 11-months thus far in 2023).\nThe path to a new ATH has always involved major fluctuations of ±50% around the Active Investor Realized Price 🟠 (shown in oscillators for each cycle).\n\nShould history be our guide, it would paint a roadmap of several months of choppy conditions around this 'fair value' model (currently at ~$36k).\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe Mayer Multiple is another popular as a technical pricing model for Bitcoin, simply describing the ratio between price and 200-day moving average. The 200-day MA is a widely recognized indicator for establishing macro bull or bear bias, making it a useful reference point for assessing overbought and oversold conditions.\n\nHistorically, overbought and oversold conditions have coincided with Mayer Multiple values exceeding 2.4, or below 0.8, respectively.\n\nThe present value of the Mayer Multiple indicator is at 1.47, close to the ~1.5 level which often forms a level of resistance in prior cycles, including the Nov 2021 ATH. Perhaps as an indicator for the severity of the 2021-22 bear market, it has been 33.5-months since this level was breached, the longest period since the 2013-16 bear.\n\nLive Standard Workbench\n\nAnother lens for assessing 'fair value' for Bitcoin is to translate on-chain activity into the price domain via the NVT Price model. The NVT Price is seeking a fundamental valuation of the network based on its utility as a settlement layer for USD-denominated value.\n\nHere, we consider a 28-day 🟢 and a 90-day 🔴 variants, providing a pair of fast and slow signals, respectively. A typical bear-to-bull transition phase sees the faster 28-day variant trading above the 90-day model, a condition which has been in play since October.\n\nThe NVT Premium 🟠 can also be used to assess spot pricing relative to the slower 90-day NVT Price. The recent rally printed one of the sharpest spikes in the NTV premium indicator since the market top in Nov 2021. This suggests a potential near-term 'overvaluation' signal relative to network throughput.\n\n💡\nThis pricing model utilizes Glassnode's proprietary Entity-Adjusted transaction volume to obtain the most accurate view on economic transfers.\nLive Professional Workbench\nThe Marginal Investor\n\nIn prior editions of this newsletter (WoC 38) we explored the outsized influence that new investors (also called Short-Term Holders) have in shaping near-term price action such as local tops and bottoms. Conversely, activity by Long-Term Holders tends to have more significant influence as the market reaches macro extremes, such as breaking to new ATHs or during painful capitulation events and bottom formation (see Following the Smart Money and Buying High and Selling Low).\n\nTo reinforce the impact of STH behavior, the following chart highlights the relationship between price moves (trends and volatility) and changes in the profitability of this cohort of investors:\n\nSTH Supply In Profit 🟢: The number of coins held 'in profit' by STHs, having a cost-basis lower than the current spot price.\n30D-Floor 🟨: The minimum 'in-profit' STH coin supply over the last 30-days.\n90D-Floor 🟥: The minimum 'in-profit' STH coin supply over the last 90-days.\n\nThese 30D and 90D indicators allow us to gauge the proportion of STH capital which is 'in -profit' over different time windows. In other words, we can compare these traces to measure how many STH coins have been held 'in-profit' for under 30-days, 30 to 90-days, and more than 90-days.\n\nHistorically, rallies towards new ATHs coincide with the 90-day metric reaching above 2M BTC, suggesting a moderately long hold time by this cohort (a robust investor base). The rally since October has primarily lifted the 30-days variant, suggesting a solid STH foundation has not yet been established since trading above the $30k mid-cycle level (see WoC 43).\n\nWe also note 2023 traces are relatively low compared to past cycles, reinforcing the relative supply tightness we covered in WoC 46.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nShort-Term Fear and Greed\n\nThe next step is to build a tool that identifies periods of heightened fear and greed among these newer investors, focusing on overbuying (tops) or overselling (bottoms) signals. We introduced the STH-Supply Profit / Loss Ratio in WoC 18, which provides a proportional look at unrealized profit to loss. As shown in the chart below:\n\nProfit/Loss Ratios > 20 historically align with overheating conditions.\nProfit/Loss Ratios < 0.05 historically align with oversold conditions.\nProfit/Loss Ratios ~ 1.0 signifies break-even and tends to align with support/resistance levels within the prevailing market trend.\n\nSince January, this metric has traded above ~1, with several retests and support found at this level. These conditions are historically associated with 'buy-the-dip' investor behavior patterns common during uptrends.\n\nWe also note that the October rally drove this metric well above the overheated level of 20, which signals a higher-risk structure and a similar 'overheated' condition to the NTV-Premium indicator.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nThe above oscillator accounts for the Unrealized Profit/Loss held by STHs, which can be considered their 'incentive to spend.' The next step is to assess whether these new investors took action and Realized Profits (or losses), bringing supply back onto the market and creating sell-side resistance.\n\nThe chart below maps four different measures of realized profit/loss by STHs (all normalized by Market Cap):\n\n🟢 STH Volume in Profit to Exchanges and 🔵 STH Realized Profit\n🟠 STH Volume in Loss to Exchanges and 🔴 STH Realized Loss\n\nThe key insight from this study is identifying periods where there is a reading across both the Realized Profit/Loss, and Volume in Profit/Loss to Exchange pairs. In other words, STHs are both sending lots of coins to exchanges, and the average delta between acquisition and disposal prices is large.\n\nWith this in mind, this week's rally to $44.2k provoked a high degree of STH profit-taking activity, suggesting this cohort acted upon their paper gains, taking advantage of demand liquidity.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nWe can then distill this observation further by highlighting days where STH realized profit increased by more than one standard deviation over the last 90-day average 🟥. We can see that this indicator has flagged local peaks throughout the last three years.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nUsing the same workflow, periods of high loss taking by STHs typically reaches one standard deviation level during major sell-off events. This signals when investors panic and send recently acquired coins back to exchanges for disposal at a loss.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nWe can of course bring both of these indicators into a single chart, creating a tool to help identify near-term overheated/oversold conditions based on the spending behavior of the STH cohort.\n\nAs we can see, the recent rally to $44.2k was accompanied by a statistically meaningful degree of profit-taking by STHs. Alongside the NTV-premium and extended Realized Profit/Loss Ratio, we can see a confluence of factors suggesting a potential saturation of demand (exhaustion) may be in play.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nConclusion\n\nBitcoin performed a round-trip this week, rallying to new yearly highs before selling off back towards its weekly open. After such a powerful 2023 thus far, this rally in particular seems to have met resistance, with on-chain data suggesting STHs are a key driver.\n\nWe present a series of indicators and frameworks highlighting local over and under-valuation for Bitcoin. These metrics draw on both investor cost basis, technical averages, and on-chain fundamentals such as transaction volumes. We can then seek confluence within (un)realized profit/loss metrics, which show when investors start taking chips off the table.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nGaining Ground\n\nBitcoin continues to lead as one of the best performing assets globally in 2023. Not only has BTC appreciated over 140% YTD, it has more than doubled relative to gold, and still dominates against the rest of the digital asset industry.\n\nGlassnode, UkuriaOC\nDec 5, 2023 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBitcoin has broken above the psychological $40k level, posting an impressive +140% year-to-date return, and firmly outperforming its hard money analogue, Gold.\nCompared to previous cycles, the BTC return profile is eerily similar to the 2015-17 and 2018-22 cycles in terms of recovery duration, and drawdown since the ATH.\nWith such an impressive year for Bitcoin, a super-majority of Bitcoin investors are now back in the black, with several metrics crossing into 'enthusiastic uptrend' territory.\n📊\nView all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nBitcoin crossed over the $40k mark to open December, providing another reminder of just how remarkable 2023 has been for the asset. In this week’s edition, we will compare the relative performance of Bitcoin to other assets in 2023, and in past cycles. We will also assess on-chain indicators related to the investor response to yet another powerful week in the market.\n\nOf note, Gold also pushed to new all-time-highs over $2,110 relative to the USD this week, setting a new historical high against all fiat currencies. Indexed to the start of the year, BTC has outperformed both USD and Gold denominators:\n\n🟠 BTC vs USD: +141.6%\n🟡 BTC vs Gold: +106.6%\nLive Chart\n\nBitcoin has consistently posted the strongest performance amongst the digital asset ecosystem this year as well, with Ethereum and wider Altcoin sectors only experiencing an uptick in relative strength over recent months. The total YTD growth in the market cap for these sectors is impressive:\n\n🟠 Bitcoin: +141.6%\n🔵 Ethereum: +79.4%\n🔴 Altcoins (excl ETH and Stablecoins): +62.3%\n🛠️\nWorkbench Tip: This chart indexes prices to the 1-Jan-2023 by using the value_at(m1,\"2023-01-01\") function, returning price at the reference date.\nLive Chart\n\nMarket performance for BTC since the cycle high is also strikingly similar to both the 2013-17 and 2017-21 periods. Note that here we use the April 2021 market top as the cycle peak, which we argue is a better reference point for comparing cycle duration. This is on the basis of a very broad spectrum of metrics which signalled that this was the zenith in market sentiment, adoption rates, and investor confidence (see WoC-4 from Jan 2022 titled Sizing Up a Bitcoin Bear).\n\n🔴 2013-17: down -42% from ATH\n🔵 2017-21: down -39% from ATH\n⚫ 2021-23: down -37% from ATH\n🛠️\nWorkbench Tip: This chart uses a combination of subset and shift functions to isolate price over a specified date range, and then shift traces to the same starting x-ordinate.\nLive Chart\n\nIf we assess cycle performance from the opposite extreme, the cycle low, we see similar points of comparison with the 2015-18 and 2018-22 cycles. BTC prices are up +146% since the FTX lows set in November 2022, making for the strongest ~1yr returns out of the last two cycles. Overall performance remains very much in line with past cycles over the same recovery duration.\n\n🔵 2015-18: +119%\n🟢 2018-22: +128%\n⚫ 2022-23: +146%\nLive Chart\n\nAnother framework for considering the relative strength of this uptrend is to measure the depth of pullbacks from the most recent local high. The deepest correction in 2023 has been a remarkably shallow -20.1%, standing out as the shallowest of any historical macro uptrend.\n\nThe 2016-17 bull market saw regular corrections exceeding -25%, whilst 2019 pulled back from the July-2019 high of $14k by over -62%. This suggests a level of underlying demand support in 2023 which aligns with the increasingly tight supply dynamics we covered in WoC-45 and WoC-46.\n\n📊\nThe above metrics which track Cycle Performance for Bitcoin and Ethereum are available in our curated Price Performance Dashboards.\nLive Chart\nAn Uptick in Exchange Activity\n\nFollowing periods of impressive performance, it becomes prudent to monitor transactions related to Exchanges, seeking any notable deviations in activity or capital flows. Despite a strong year thus far, the number of transactions depositing funds to Exchanges continues to plummet to multi-year lows, making for a counter intuitive observation.\n\nLive Chart\n\nHowever, unlike prior cycles, we must now consider transaction counts within the context of a new buyer of blockspace: Inscriptions. Since each Bitcoin block has a constrained block-space data limit, periods where Inscriptions are paying higher fees can ‘price out’ exchange deposits which are paying lower fees.\n\nIf we look at Exchange Deposits as a percentage of all transactions 🟠, it would suggest they have dropped from around 26% in May to just 10% today. However if we adjust for Inscriptions, comparing deposits only to non-inscription transactions 🔵, we see the decline is more modest to around 20%.\n\nThis suggests that Inscriptions are currently willing to pay a higher priority fee than Exchange related deposits.\n\nLive Chart\n\nLooking at this from the on-chain volume domain, we can see that YTD flows in and out of Exchanges has grown considerably from $930M to over $3B (+220%). This underscores an expanding interest from investors to trade, accumulate, speculate and otherwise utilze exchanges for their services.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWith a such a large uptick in Exchange volumes, an interesting observation emerges from analysis of the average size of a deposits to Exchanges. This metric has experienced a non-trivial rally, climbing just shy of the previous ATH of $30k per deposit.\n\nFrom this it appears that exchange deposits are currently dominated by investors moving increasingly large sums of money. This is potentially a sign of growing institutional interest as key ETF decision dates approaches in January 2024.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhilst the number of transactions to and from Exchanges is relatively low, volumes flowing in/out are responsible for 72.2% of all on-chain volume, on par with the previous ATH. This emphasizes how a substantial proportion of on-chain throughput is related to exchange activity, as investors deposit and withdraw in increasing size and volume.\n\nLive Chart\nSupply Moves into Profit\n\nThe 2023 rally has pushed Bitcoin’s price decisively above two key on-chain pricing levels:\n\nThe Realized Price in January, putting the average unit of BTC into profit (includes ancient and lost coins).\nThe True Market Mean Price in October, putting the average active investor back into profit.\n\nWith the market now trading meaningfully above the True Market Mean Price ($31.0k), the majority of Bitcoin holders will have seen their portfolios recover from the 2022 bear market. Historically this has signalled a constructive transition towards a more enthusiastic bull market.\n\n🕰️\nThe True Market Mean Price was developed as part of our Cointime Economics report, covering a new framework for Bitcoin on-chain analytics.\nLive Chart\n\nFrom the perspective of Long-Term Holders, the YTD rally has seen the proportion of their holdings held in profit increase from 56% to 84%. This has broken above the all time average value of 81.6%.\n\nPrevious breakouts above this level have historically aligned with a transition towards strong up-trending markets, providing confluence with the above observation.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Short-Term Holder cohort are almost entirely in profit, with over 95% of their holdings sporting a cost basis below the current spot price. This reading is above the long-term +1 standard deviation level for this metric, and is again historically associated with enthusiastic uptrends.\n\nLive Chart\nMarginal Profits Realized\n\nNow that we have established that several cohorts of investors are back in profit, the next logical step is to assess if there are any discernible shifts in profit taking and spending by these cohorts. For this, we can employ the SOPR metric which provides a view into the average profit or loss multiple locked in.\n\nCurrently, several SOPR variants are trading above 1.0, suggesting the average spent coin is locking in a profit across many cohorts:\n\n🟠 Wider Market: SOPR = 1.09 (+9% profit on average)\n🔴 Short-Term Holders: STH-SOPR = 1.01 (+1% profit on average)\n🔵 Long-Term Holders: LTH-SOPR = 1.46 (+46% profit on average)\n🛠️\nWorkbench Tip: Here we use an if-then conditional statement to highlight periods where all 3 variants of the SOPR metric are above the break-even level of 1.0.\nLive Chart\n\nWe can extend this insight by monitoring the number of consecutive days where all three SOPR variants have traded above 1.0. The current rally has seen this condition persist for 44 days, which is longer than the average duration of 17 days, and is also the longest stretch since the Nov 2021 ATH.\n\nOverall, this indicates that a super majority of Bitcoin holders are in profit, and sufficient demand is flowing in to absorb the distributed supply.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe net USD denominated realized profit locked in by the market has reached $324M/day, which remains an order of magnitude below the peaks experienced during the later stages of the 2021 bull market (which eclipsed $3B/day).\n\nThis suggests that whilst market performance is strong, and investors are enjoying meaningful profit, it remains very much within the bounds of an early rather than a late stage bull market.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nBitcoin continues to lead as one of the best performing assets globally in 2023. Not only has BTC appreciated over 140% YTD, it has more than doubled relative to gold, and still dominates against the rest of the digital asset industry.\n\nWith such strong performance, the super-majority of Bitcoin holders are now back in profit, with a small proportion of them realizing those gains. Several on-chain metrics suggest the recent rally has pushing the market out of a 'transitional recovery zone', and now more closely resembles an 'enthusiastic bull market'.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "Ethereum and DeFi\nTwists and Turns\n\nThe growth rate of the Ethereum validator set has slowed in recent weeks, as an increasing number of validators voluntarily exit. This has slowed the rate of ETH issuance. Alongside increasing ETH burnt via EIP1559 due to growing network activity, the ETH supply has turned deflationary once again.\n\nGlassnode, Alice Kohn\nNov 28, 2023 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe Ethereum staking pool has experienced a significant trend change marked by an increasing amount of validators exiting since October. This development correlates with a broader bullish uptrend across digital asset markets.\nThe increased number of validator exits has contributed to a decline in daily ETH issuance, which is related to the amount of active ETH within the staking pool.\nSimultaneously, we have seen increased network activity, driven by renewed interest in tokens and stablecoins. This is reflected by an increase in gas fees being burnt via EIP1559 triggering a deflationary turn the ETH supply.\n\nUndoubtedly, the most significant headline of the past week was the resignation of Binance CEO CZ. The settlement amount reached with the authorities stands at $4.3 billion, with many seeing this pivotal event as a marker for the end of the 'wild-west' years of the digital asset industry.\n\nFollowing this announcement, the price of BNB experienced a -9.1% decline. However, this market reaction is relatively moderate when compared to previous price drops, such as the -24% fall when the SEC announced charges earlier in the year.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFollowing this news, the Binance exchange experienced an uptick in withdrawal activity across major assets. The aggregate balance of a range of DeFi 'blue-chips' decreased by -6.7% within the first 24 hours, while BTC, ETH and Stablecoin balances declined by -4.4%, -4.9% and -2.2%, respectively.\n\nHowever, in the six days following CZ's resignation, these exchange balances saw a recovery, with all four token categories seeing a slowdown of outflows, and indeed a return to net inflows. In many ways this demonstrates a level of trust users have in the Binance platform. It could also be argued that confidence may even improve given the settlement requirement for US regulator oversight over the next three years.\n\nLive Chart\nValidator Exits\n\nWhile not capturing the same headlines as the Binance settlement, the Ethereum staking pool has has experienced a notable shift since the start of October. An increasing number of validators are currently exiting the staking pool.\n\nShanghai enabled stake withdrawals, and was followed by a surge in validators exiting, claiming rewards, and reshuffling their staking provider and setup. Exiting events averaged 309 validators per day during this time.\n\nSince early October, we have seen a gradual increase in exiting events, reaching an average of 1018 validators per day. This uptick aligns with the recent uptrend in spot prices across digital asset markets.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nConsequently, the Total Effective Balance, representing the ETH in the Staking Pool, that is actively participating in Proof-of-Stake Consensus, has slowed in its growth and is now experiencing the first decline since the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nThe gradient of the Total Effective Balance began to flatten out in mid-October, registering an average increase of 0.1% to 1% per day, more than halving the growth rate sustained since May.\n\nLive Chart\n\nUpon closer examination of exiting validators, we can see it is largely driven by voluntary exits over the past eight weeks. Voluntary exits refer to stakers who independently choose to exit the staking pool. This is distinct from slashing, which is a penalty applied to validators which violate protocol rules.\n\nIn the same timeframe, only two slashing events have occurred, one of which was substantial, involving 100 newly-entered validators, slashed for simultaneously signing two different blocks of the network.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: We deep dive into the ETH Staking Dynamics in our dashboard ETH Proof-of-Stake Consensus.\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nExiting validators can be further categorized by the staker type they belong to. This reveals a few interesting trends:\n\nCentralized exchanges (CEXs) have consistently dominated stake withdrawal events since October, with Kraken and Coinbase seeing the largest outflows.\nLiquid Staking Providers have also experienced a modest uptick in withdrawn stake as well, with Lido remaining the largest player in the space.\n\nThere are a few points which may be driving this investor behavior:\n\nInvestors opting to change their staking setup, for example transferring stake from CEXs to Liquid Staking Providers (perhaps due to ongoing regulatory concerns).\nInvestors with access to US capital markets may be rotating capital towards safer assets such as US treasuries as interest rates remain elevated relative to ETH staking returns.\nInvestors may also be seeking greater liquidity for held ETH in anticipation of an imminent market uptrend, rather than less liquid staked ETH.\n\nKraken and Coinbase stand out as top providers seeing withdrawals, while Lido leads in exits among Liquid Staking Providers. However, these same entities, with Lido taking the lead, are also the primary recipients of stake deposits, showing a net stickiness and dominance of these large pools of capital.\nLive Chart\n\nOn a net change basis, Lido continues to grow in dominance, increasing its aggregate staked balance by 468k ETH. Across CEXs, Coinbase and Binance have seen a net increase in their staking balances, whilst Kraken has reduced its stake balance by -19.4k ETH. Among staking providers, HTX and Staked.us exhibit the most significant reduction in their staking balances, each decreasing by over ETH -44k.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAligned with the observed reduction in Effective Balance, there has been a corresponding decrease in ETH issuance. The daily issuance of ETH to validators is contingent on the number of Active Validators, or respectively, the Total Effective Balance within the staking pool.\n\nAs the growth rate of validators slows and declines, the daily ETH issuance has experienced a corresponding slowdown. Over the last 7-days, the growth rate of ETH issuance has slowed by up to 0.5% per day. Notably, the rate of issuance has decreased for the first time in recent days.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs issuance rates experience a decline, we now turn our attention to the complementary aspect of the equation—the burn rate. Initiated with the London hardfork in 2021, the fee-burning mechanism of EIP1559 involves the burning of a portion of transaction fees, setting the stage for the ETH supply to become deflationary with elevated network usage.\n\nIn tandem with rising gas prices, which signify growing transaction demand on the Ethereum network, the daily amount of ETH fees burned has increased as well. In October, we see the amount of ETH fees being burnt reaching 899 ETH per day. Fast forward almost one month, and the accumulated fees burnt has now reached 5,368 ETH.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: We deep dive into the complex ETH Supply Dynamice in our dashboard ETH Supply and Issuance.\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also assess a detailed breakdown of gas usage across various transaction types. These metrics enable us to identify activities that predominantly contribute to the supply burn.\n\nUpon examining the two sectors that historically fuelled Ethereum network adoption, it becomes evident that both NFT transactions and DeFi transactions are contributing relatively little over the past four months, with decreases of -3% and -57%, respectively. Both sectors have seen declining adoption and are contributing little to the latest surge in activity on-chain.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe recent surge in network activities is primarily attributed to token transfers and stablecoins. Gas usage for tokens has risen by +8.2% over the last three months, whilst stablecoin gas usage has increased by +19%. This suggests a potential light capital rotation is taking place towards longer-tail assets as confidence in market strength increases.\n\nLive Chart\n\nSince the London hardfork, the ETH transitioned from net inflationary towards a state of equilibrium and outright or deflation. The network experienced a brief period of net inflation between August and October as a result of lower network activity.\n\nIn recent weeks, as a result of both declining issuance rates, and larger volumes of supply burnt, the aggregate ETH supply has turned net deflationary once again.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nRecent weeks have seen a notable shift in the Ethereum staking pool dynamics, as the number of validators exiting the pool starts to increase. This has resulted in a slowdown of the growth rate for ETH issuance, and the first reducion in the staking pool balance since the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nFurthermore, a recent surge in network activities, particularly driven by token transfers and stablecoins, has led to elevated transaction demand. This has in turn put upwards pressure on gas prices, creating an increase in daily ETH fees burned via EIP1559.\n\nThese two forces in combination have resulted in the global ETH supply turning deflationary once again. In this context, the interplay of these factors underscores the dynamic nature of the Ethereum network, supply and its responsiveness to trends in market activity and adoption.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nKeeping A Firm Grip\n\nThe volume of Bitcoin supply in profit has reached the levels last was seen 2 years ago as the market came off the Nov 2021 ATH. However, the magnitude of unrealized profit held within these coins remains modest, and thus far insufficient to motivate long-term holders to lock in profits.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nNov 20, 2023 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nAs the market trades at yearly highs, over 83.6% of the Bitcoin coin supply are now held in profit, being the highest level since November 2021 (near the ATH).\nHowever, the magnitude of unrealized profit held, measured as the delta between spot price and the coins cost basis, remains modest.\nThe degree of unrealized profit held by investors is thus far an insufficient incentive to motivate long-term holder to spend, keeping the overall supply relatively tight.\n📊\nView all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nBitcoin continues its strong price performance, trading near year to date highs and pushing over $37.9k this week. As a result, over 16.366M BTC are now held in profit, equivalent to 83.6% of the Circulating Supply. This puts the coin volume in profit at levels similar to the 2021 bull market highs.\n\nIn this edition, we will explore what this means for investor profitability, and how it compares to past bull market conditions.\n\nAdvanced Live Workbench\nAccumulation Across the Board\n\nWe will start with a view on investor accumulation behavior, considering the balance change of on-chain wallets. Using the Accumulation Trend Score, we can illustrate how this most recent rally is seeing greater accumulation patterns than others this year.\n\nUnlike the first two rallies of 2023, this indicator is signalling a robust accumulation regime (dark colors) during recent price expansion, supporting the price spiking +39% over the last 30 days.\n\n💡\nChart Tip: This metric applies a 7-day Simple Moving Average to smooth between each daily data point, and improve visualisation.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nConsidering different wallet sizes, a more detailed assessment can break down this accumulation score by cohorts. A distinct shift has occurred since late October, where investors of all wallet sizes have seen a substantial uptick in their holdings (denoted in 🟦).\n\nWe can see that conditions throughout 2023 have seen net outflows 🟥 across several cohorts, suggesting a non-uniform behavior by different investor cohorts. This broad uptick in accumulation means that strong market performance and increasingly optimistic hopes around a spot BTC ETF are improving investor confidence in the uptrend.\n\nLive Professional Dashboard\nA Profitable Rally\n\nWith price retesting yearly highs, the percentage of the supply held in profit has reached 83% of the total circulating supply. From a statistical standpoint, this is historically significant, being well above the all-time mean value (74%) and pushing towards the higher band of +1 standard deviation 90%.\n\nWhen this indicator trades above this upper band, it has historically aligned with the market entering the early stages of a bull market's \"Euphoric phase.\"\n\n🛠️\nWorkbench Tip: This chart uses the cummean(m1) and cumstd(m1) functions to calculate all-time mean and standard deviation bands.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nTo put the current supply profitability into perspective, the chart below highlights three typical cycle phases over the last 5 years.\n\nBottom Discovery 🟥 where less than 58% (-1 std) of circulating coins are in profit.\nBear/Bull Transition 🟨 where the market is recovering from the Bottom Discovery phase (or falling from Euphoria) by trading within 58% of supply in profit and 90%.\nEuphoria 🟩 where most coins are in profit as the price is reaching the last ATH (+1 std).\n\nThe market has been within the Bear/Bull Transition phase for the past 10 months, as it recovered from the 2022 bear trend. The majority of 2023 has traded below the all-time average, with the October rally being the first sustained break above.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nVolume vs Magnitude\n\nIt is important to note that the prior charts measured the coin volume held in profit, being coins with a cost basis lower than the spot price. This, however, is different from the magnitude of unrealized profit held, which assesses the delta between the cost basis and the current rate.\n\nFor the analysis of investor behavior, often the unrealized profit is a more critical variable as it relates back to the USD-denominated profit of investor positions.\n\nThe next chart applies the same mean and ±1 std bands to the Unrealized Profit indicator. From this, we can directly measure the magnitude of profit held by investors. This metric shows, on average, how much profit is stored in the market for every dollar worth of bitcoin.\n\nUnlike the prior coin volume metrics, the magnitude of Unrealized Profit has not yet reached a statistically high level coincident with the heated stages of the bull market. It is currently trading at the all-time mean level of 49%, significantly lower than the extreme levels of 60%+ seen in the euphoria phase of past bull markets.\n\nThis suggests that whilst a significant volume of the supply is in profit, most have a cost basis, which is only moderately below the current spot price.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nA Strong Divergence\n\nAnother remarkable phenomena is the increasing divergence between the supply held by long-term holders and short-term holders.\n\nAs discussed in WOC 45, Long-Term Holder (LTH) supply 🔵 has been continuously hitting new all-time highs since November 2022, reaching 14.9M BTC at the time of writing. Conversely, Short-Term Holder (STH) supply 🔴 has declined to 2.3M BTC, which is effectively a new all-time low.\n\nThis dynamic indicates the existing holders have become increasingly unwilling to part with their holdings, as they historically wait for the market to break to a new price ATH (see our prior report). This can be interpreted as investors requiring a higher unrealized profit (magnitude) before ramping up their distribution pressure.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nThe Road Ahead\n\nWe have now established that market profitability is slightly above its statistical midpoint. Next, we will explore how these tools can provide a macro blueprint of the road ahead based on prior cycles.\n\nThe first tool focuses on the supply held in Profit/Loss held by Long-Term Holders (LTH). We note that Long-Term Supply tends to be quite cyclical, and we have highlighted various regimes of strong spending 🔴 and strong holding 🟢 patterns on the chart below.\n\nBefore reclaiming the ATH, LTH supply goes through a lengthy re-accumulation period, with a generally flat to modest rise in aggregate supply held.\nAs the market breaks the previous cycle ATH, the incentive to ramp up spending increases significantly. This results in a dramatic decline in LTH supply, transferring coins to newer buyers at increasingly expensive prices.\n\nThroughout the 2022 bear market, the first phase has played out very consistent with past cycles, with LTH supply climbing strongly. This shows a remarkable resilience of BTC holders, despite growing losses held by this cohort last year. However, unlike the 2015-26 and 2018-20 cycles, there have been fewer dips and oscillations due to spending, with LTH supply tending to push higher and higher. This speaks to a degree of supply tightness which we covered in WoC 45 and WoC 46.\n\n💡\nChart Tip: This chart isolates Long-Term Holders by turning off two traces associated with Short-Term Holders (by clicking the legend items).\nLive Professional Chart\n\nUsing these observations, we revisit a compass we introduced in WoC 22, which gauges spending behavior by LTHs. This tool helps to break the long and rocky road between bear market lows and the new ATHs into three sub-intervals:\n\nBottom Discovery 🟥 where price trades below the LTH Cost Basis.\nEquilibrium 🟧 where price trades above the LTH Cost Basis but below the previous ATH.\nPrice Discovery 🟩 as price breaks above the last cycle ATH and LTH spending accelerates.\n\nThis Spending Binary Indicator (SBI) tracks whether LTH spending is of an intensity sufficient to decrease the total LTH Supply over a sustained 7-day period. It currently indicates very little spending is taking place by LTHs, adding further evidence to supply tightness.\n\n🛠️\nWorkbench Tip: AND conditionals can be setup in workbench by multiplying two or more if-then statements, where TRUE = 1.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nTo wrap up, we can merge the SBI indicator and the relative position of the spot price, and LTH cost basis to construct a new tool for tracking market sentiment. We consider four sub-categories for spotting shifts in LTH divestment:\n\nCapitulation 🟥 where spot price is lower than the LTH cost basis, and therefore, any strong spending is likely due to financial pressure and capitulation (Conditions: LTH-MVRV < 1 and SBI > 0.55).\nTransition 🟧 where price trades slightly above the long-term holders' cost basis, and occasional light spending is part of day-to-day activity (Conditions: 1.0 < LTH-MVRV < 1.5 and SBI > 0.55).\nEquilibrium 🟨 after recovering from a prolonged bear, the market seeks a new balance between a light in-flow demand, lighter liquidity, and underwater holders from the previous cycle. Strong LTH spending during this stage is usually associated with sudden rallies or corrections (Conditions: 1.5 < LTH-MVRV < 3.5 and SBI > 0.55).\nEuphoria 🟩 as LTH-MVRV reaches 3.5 (historically aligned with the market hitting the prior ATH), LTHs are holding upwards of 250% profit on average. The market enters a euphoria phase, which motivates these investors to spend at very high, and accelerating rates (Conditions: LTH-MVRV > 3.5 and SBI > 0.55).\n\nFollowing the recent rally above $37.1k (LTH at >50% profit), the market experienced an uptick in LTH’s spending, flagging the first intensive cash out by these players via the \"Equilibrium Phase.\"\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nConclusion\n\nWith the recent price rally, the volume of coins in profit has reached the levels that last was seen 2 years ago as the market came off the Nov 2021 ATH. However, the magnitude of unrealized profit held within these coins remains modest, and thus far insufficient to motivate long-term holders to lock in profits.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nSupply Squeeze\n\nThe fourth Bitcoin halving is fast approaching, being an important milestone both for the asset, and for investors. In this edition, we deep dive into the impressive tightness of BTC supply, and demonstrate how we can measure investor accumulation patterns in the lead up to the event.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nNov 13, 2023 • 9 min read\nExecutive Summary\nWith the fourth Bitcoin halving fast approaching, estimated in April 2024, a tightness is forming within the Bitcoin supply which has reached historical levels.\nWe assess a variety of measures for both 'available supply', as well as rates of 'supply storage' by longer-term investors which exceeds new issuance by 200%+.\nUsing a relationship between Market Cap and Realized Cap, we estimate this supply tightness results in capital inflows into BTC is having an outsized impact on valuation.\n📊\nView all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nAssessing Supply Dynamics Into the 2024 Bitcoin Halving\n\nThe halving event is one of the most anticipated events on the Bitcoin calendar, occurring every 210,000 blocks, and cutting the rate of new coin issuance by 50%. Whilst the fourth halving is pre-determined to occur at block-height 840,000, the exact date and time is unknown due to the natural variability and probabilistic nature of mining blocks.\n\nOur best estimate given the current average block interval is that the halving is 158-days away, expected on the 23-April-2024.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nGiven the high CAPEX and OPEX demands of mining, Bitcoin miners have historically distributed a majority of their BTC income to cover costs. The YTD high of USD value issued to miners via newly minted supply is ~$1B/month, which is a non-trivial capital inflow headwind.\n\nIn a post 2024 halving world, this would be cut to $500M/month, which is comparable with the $450M/month distribution pressure around the FTX lows, set one year ago.\n\n💡\nAlert Idea: Get a Glassnode alert when the 2024 Halving occurs when BTC Issuance drops by 50% using the Percent Down condition.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAside from the technical elegance and unstoppable nature of the Bitcoin halving, it is also a point of interest for investors. All prior halvings have experiencing impressive market performance in the 365-days that followed.\n\nThis naturally creates a point of intrigue as to whether the halving is the primary driver of these price appreciation cycles, or merely one of many factors. In this edition we will explore this through the lens of supply and investor behavior patterns to add some colour to the debate from an on-chain perspective.\n\nWe will break this into three analysis stages:\n\nAssessing the 'Available and Active' Supply\nMeasuring rates of 'Supply Storage and Saving'\nAnalysing the Impact of Capital Flows on Market Valuation\n🛠️\nWorkbench Tip: This chart aligns past cycles using a combination of the subset(m1,start,end) and shift(m1,period) functions.\nLive Advanced Chart\nAssessing Available Supply\n\nOur first port of call is to establish an estimate of the volume of BTC which is mobile, active, and freely circulating. In other words, what is the available supply that investors can reasonably expect to change hands in the near term?\n\nThe chart below covers several supply heuristics using 'coin-age' as the main input, measuring the time since a coin was last spent on-chain. Short-Term Holder Supply is currently at multi-year lows of 2.33M BTC, and captures coins up to 155-days old that are statistically the most likely to be spent.\n\nOther metrics which describe 'hotter' supply include coins younger than 1-month (1.39M BTC), but could also consider Futures Open Interest (0.41M BTC BTC) as a form of 'supply exposure' in derivative markets.\n\nCombined, this 'hot supply' volume is equivalent to between 5% and 10% of the circulating supply which is participating in day-to-day trade.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nGlassnode developed another supply heuristic that monitors the spending behavior of wallets, classified into Illiquid, Liquid and Highly Liquid buckets. The latter two are shown below which represent wallets that both receive coins and also spend a significant proportion of them.\n\nOf note is the multi-year decline that started in March 2020 when the world experienced a seismic shift brought on by the pandemic and social response to it.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThere is significant overlap between Liquid and Highly Liquid supply and Exchange Balances for obvious reasons. This multi-year downtrend is visible again, suggesting coins are moving out of Exchange wallets and towards more Illiquid wallets with little history of spending.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nAn important nuance of this is the role of both institutional grade custodians, and ETF style products like GBTC (a useful reference for any future spot ETF vehicles). The chart below shows our best estimate of aggregate on-chain volumes for our Coinbase Exchange, Coinbase Custody, and GBTC clusters.\n\nNote again the March 2020 turning point where demand for both GBTC and custody products increased significantly, both of which will classify as Illiquid supply in many instances.\n\nIf we compare Short-Term Holder Supply and Exchange Balances, we can see they are of a similar magnitude of around 2.3M BTC. Combined, these two measures of 'available supply' equate to 23.8% of the circulating supply, which is now at an all-time-low.\n\nIt could be argued that this puts available BTC supply at historical lows on a relative basis.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nMeasuring Rates of Stored and Saved Supply\n\nWe have established that the general trend for various measures of 'available supply' is declining. This trend is now a few years old, but has notably accelerated since the market wide sell-off in June 2022 (LUNA-UST and 3AC).\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nBy contrast, when we overlay the inverse measures of 'saved or stored' supply, we can see a remarkable divergence is forming. Here we consider 'stored supply' using the following heuristics:\n\nLong-Term Holder Supply (Coins older than -155-days, dark blue)\nIlliquid Supply (wallets with limited spending history, light blue)\nVaulted Supply (deep HODLed and Lost supply, see Cointime Economics, green)\n\nThis divergence is meaningful in that it suggests coins are generally migrating away from Exchange balances, speculators, and active trade, and towards cold storage, custody, and wallets of longer-term investors.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nTo get a sense of scale, we can compare the rate at which coins are being stored and saved relative to new issuance. At present, approximately 81k BTC are mined each quarter which will soon decrease to ~40.5k BTC/qtr after the halving.\n\nIf we overlay the 90-day change in Illiquid Supply, we can see there has been a sustained uptick in illiquid balances through all prior halving events. This suggests investor buy-side tends to ramp up in the lead up to and through the halving, often significantly exceeding the rate of issuance both before and after the event.\n\nIlliquid Supply is currently increasing at a rate of 180k BTC/qtr which is 2.2x more than issuance.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThrough the lens of 'stored supply' using investor holding time as the input, we see a similar accumulation pattern for Long-Term Holders (blue) and Vaulted Supply (green). Interestingly, this investor behavior seems to come in three waves:\n\nWave 1 during the middle of the bear as prices correct sharply from the ATH.\nWave 2 during later stages of the bear as the cycle floor is established.\nWave 3 leading into and through the halving as investors acquire in anticipation.\n🛠️\nWorkbench Tip: Here we have hidden negative values to improve visualisation using the if-then function if(f1,\"<\",0,0,f1).\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAccumulation rates can also be assessed using wallet size heuristics, where this chart considers all entities holding less than 100 BTC. These Shrimp (< 1BTC), Crabs (1 to 10BTC) and Fish (10 to 100BTC) capture a wide cross section of investors, from retail through to high net worth individuals.\n\nIn aggregate, their accumulation rates have exceeded new issuance since Feb 2022, being the longest and most sustained period in history.\n\n📰\nRelated Report: We deep dive into the Bitcoin supply distribution held by Shrimp to Whales in our report The Shrimp Supply Sink.\nLive Professional Chart\n\nTo summarise, the chart below shows the net balance change of these various 'stored' supply metrics since 1-Jan-2022. We use the change in circulating supply (orange) as our baseline, and see that the rates of accumulation by investors ranges from between 1.1x through to almost 2.5x new issuance.\n\nNot only are our measures of 'available supply' at historical lows, the rates of 'supply storage' by investors are also meaningfully higher than issuance rates in a pre-halving environment. The cyclical nature of Bitcoin market cycles duirng bear markets and halving events can be described by these investor accumulation patterns, reminding us of a saying in markets;\n\nBear markets author the bull that follows (and vice versa)\nLive Professional Chart\nAnalysing Shifting Capital Tides\n\nIn several recent WoC editions, we have focused on the rotation of capital throughout the digital asset ecosystem (see WoC 41, 42, and 44). In these editions, we use The Realized Cap as a proxy for capital inflows, outflows and rotation between assets.\n\nAt a behavioral level, long-term investors in Bitcoin tend to buy low and sell high, a process which realizes profit, and revalues coins from a low cost basis to a higher one. A coin acquired at $6k in 2018 is sold at $60k in 2021, requiring 900% more capital to flow in and acquire the same coin volume.\n\nAn important aside: whilst 'stored supply' is increasing today, the chart below is showing the inverse, where profits are taken, and 'stored supply' is spent back into liquid circulation.\n📰\nRelated Report: We developed the following two metrics during our exploration of The Realized Cap, being a foundational on-chain tool.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWith this framework in mind, we can compare the amount of capital which must flow in (or out) of the Bitcoin Realized Cap to achieve a $1 change in the Market Cap.\n\nThis final metric was first proposed in a recent research report, and can be though of as a liquidity or volatility measure. It describes how much the Realized Cap must change to achieve a $1.0 change in the Market Cap of Bitcoin. We note some interesting details:\n\nIn late stage bull markets (orange zones) more than $0.75, and often over $1.0 in capital inflows is needed to achieve a $1.0 Market Cap change. This has histrionically been found to be a unsustainable condition.\nDuring bear markets, as capital and investor attention drains, this can drop to between $0.10 and $0.30. This leads to more volatile price swings, as small capital inflows or outflows result in an outsized impact.\n\nThis metric is close to the long-term median (in red) of $0.25, suggesting Bitcoin supply and liquidity is fairly tight. A capital inflow/outflow of $0.25 is creating a $1.0 change in the market cap. In many ways, this aligns with the supply dynamics discussed above, where 'available supply' is indeed historically low, storage rates are up, and liquidity is thinner as a result.\n\n🛠️\nWorkbench Tip: This chart uses an if(f1,\">\",0.75,0,m1) function to highlight price m1 whene the metric f1 is above a threshold value of 0.75.\nLive Advanced Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe fourth halving event is fast approaching and represents an important fundamental, technical, and philosophical milestone for Bitcoin. For investors, it is also an area of intrigue given the impressive return profile in prior cycles.\n\nIn this edition we explored the tightness forming within the Bitcoin supply using a variety of supply measures and heuristics. There is notable confluence between these metrics suggesting 'available supply' is at historical lows, and rates of 'supply storage' exceed current issuance by a factor of up to 2.4x.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Tightening of Supply\n\nThe Bitcoin Supply is historically tight, with an all-time-high in coins held by Long-Term investors, and impressive rates of accumulation taking place. In this edition we explore this tightness using several on-chain supply heuristics and metrics.\n\nGlassnode, UkuriaOC\nNov 7, 2023 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe Bitcoin supply is quite tight with several measures of supply such as Illiquid, HODLed, and Long-Term Holder Supply at historical highs.\nThe spending behavior of Short-Term Holders suggests a shift in market character has taken place now that the market has rallied above the key $30k level.\nAnalysis of investor cost basis for various cohorts suggests that this $30k level is an important zone of interest for the bulls, with an 'air-gap' between there and $33k.\n\nThe Bitcoin halving is estimated to be ~166-days away, and a spot ETF approval in the US is starting to look increasingly likely. As a result, BTC investor excitement and sentiment is on the ascent. Within this context, a key question for investors is how much of the Bitcoin supply is freely circulating, as opposed to held tightly in investor wallets.\n\nIn this edition, we will explore this question, focusing on the distribution of the Bitcoin supply from a macro lens. We will use a variety of on-chain heuristics and metrics to gauge the tightness of the BTC supply.\n\n💡\nAll charts are available within The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nCoins Are Getting Older\n\nPrice performance of digital assets has been impressive YTD, which as we covered last week (WoC 44). Despite this, long-term Bitcoin investors remain tight gripped, with the relative proportion of circulating supply held for longer than 1yr+ hovering at all-time-highs for several age bands.\n\n🔴 Supply Last Active 1+ Yrs Ago: 68.8%\n🟡 Supply Last Active 2+ Yrs Ago: 57.1%\n🟢 Supply Last Active 3+ Yrs Ago: 41.1%\n🔵 Supply Last Active 5+ Yrs Ago: 29.6%\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe Illiquid Supply metric, which measures the amount of supply held in wallets with minimal history of spending is also at an ATH of 15.4M BTC. Changes in Illiquid Supply often move in tandem with exchange withdrawals, suggesting investors continue to withdraw their coins into custody, with over 1.7M BTC doing so since May 2021.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThis is reflected in the monthly rate of change for Illiquid Supply which is within a multi-year period of net increase, currently increasing at a rate of +71k BTC per month.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWe see a similar pattern within the HODLer Net Position Change metric (also known as Vaulted Supply within the Cointime Economics framework). Vaulted Supply has experienced a sustained regime of inflows since June 2021, however with a notable uptick following the June 2022 sell-off when 3AC and LUNA-UST collapsed.\n\nThis metric speaks to an aggregate maturation of the BTC supply, as investors accumulate and hold onto their coins, refraining from spending and transacting at an increasing rate.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nA Divergence of Conviction\n\nA powerful divergence continues to form between Long-Term Holder (LTH) supply 🔵, which is just shy of an all-time-high, and Short-Term Holder (STH) supply 🔴 which is at effectively all-time-lows. This insightful dynamic demonstrates a growing tightness within the BTC supply, as existing holders become increasingly unwilling to part with their holdings.\n\nAs we covered in our prior report, LTHs historically wait for the market to break to new price ATH before ramping up their distribution. This process can be seen by the large scale decline in their supply during the 2021 bull run, which is matched by an uptick in STH Supply, as well as Exchange inflow volumes.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nIf we take a ratio between Long and Short-Term Holder supply, we can see that it has broken out to new highs since July 2023. This clearly shows the magnitude of the divergence between dormant and mobile supply, and highlights an impressive tightness.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe Activity-to-Vaulting Ratio (A2VR) is a new metric which elegantly describes this divergence at a macro scale. It compares the all-time balance of coin 'activity' and 'inactivity’ measured through units of investor holding time (usually coin-days or coin-blocks).\n\nUptrends indicate that investors with old coins are spending, with steeper ascents indicating aggressive distribution.\nDowntrends indicate that investors prefer to hold their coins in an inactive state, with steeper trends suggesting an acceleration of this behavior.\n\nThe A2VR metric has been within a downtrend since June 2021, with the gradient steepening meaningfully after June 2022. This metric has now reached similar lows to that in early 2019 and late 2020, both preceding significant market uptrends. This also suggests that the ‘exuberance’ of the 2021-22 cycle has been completely flushed from the market.\n\n🕰️\nRead more about the Cointime Economics framework for Bitcoin by downloading our full report here.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nAnother lens to assess investor activity is via analysis of their spending behaviors. The Sell-Side Risk Ratio is a great tool to evaluate the absolute value of profit or loss locked in by investors in relation to the size of the asset (measured as the Realized Cap). We consider this metric under the following framework:\n\nHigh values indicate that investors in aggregate are spending coins at a large profit or loss relative to their cost basis.\nLow values indicate that the majority of coins being spent are close to break even, suggesting an exhaustion of ‘profit and loss’ at the current price range.\n\nIn this instance, we consider only the Short-Term Holder cohort as they are one of the primary drivers of day-to-day price action. Following the recent rally to $35k, the Sell-Side Risk Ratio spiked from historical lows, suggesting a ‘re-awakening’ of many young coins. This speaks to a near-term profit taking event by this cohort.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nFor the Long-Term Holder cohort however, their Sell-Side Risk ratio has increased slightly, yet remains extremely low in a historical context. This metric currently has a similar structure to the 2016 and late 2020 eras, which were similar periods of tight overall BTC supply.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nAccumulation Across The Board\n\nThe prior set of metrics largely consider the Bitcoin supply in terms of the aggregate ageing and maturing of coins. Another lens is to consider the supply from the context of wallet sizes. The Accumulation Trend Score metric helps track supply based on entity size, and an unusual dynamic has emerged since late October.\n\nHere we can see a near perfect inflow score 🟦across all cohorts, certainly the most stark example YTD. We can see a pattern where the market has met resistance during periods of increased net outflows 🟥 across the majority of cohorts, whilst market upticks are met with a general trend of balanced inflows 🟦. This phenomenon appears to speak to a growing investor confidence and an inflection in participant behavior.\n\nLive Chartin Glassnode Engine Room\n\nIf we isolate only entities on the smaller end of the scale such as Shrimps (<1 BTC), Crabs (1-10 BTC) and Fish (10-100 BTC), we can see their accumulation pattern is quite significant. The combined rate of balance increase for this sub-group is currently equivalent to 92% of newly mined supply, and has remained in an elevated state since May 2022.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nCost Basis Clusters\n\nTo conclude, we can use the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) to identify areas of densely concentrated cost basis, as well as airgap price zones where relatively few coins have transacted. We can see four areas of interest within close proximity to our current spot price.\n\nSection A: A large cluster of supply was accumulated between $26k and $31k through Q2 and Q3 of 2023.\nSection B: An airgap is be noted between $31k and $33k, with price having passed through here quickly.\nSection C: A significance amount of supply has recently transacted within the current price range between $33k and $35k.\nSection D: Approximately 620k BTC from the 2021-22 cycle have a cost basis just above between $35k and $40k.\nLive Professional Chart\n\nFinally, we can add color to this URPD distribution by splitting into Long-Term 🔵 and Short-Term 🔴 Holders. We note that the majority of STH coins are now profitable, with the majority sporting a cost basis between $25k and $30k. The uptick in the STH Sell-Side Risk Ratio from earlier aligns with the ‘profit-taking’ event which transferred coins to new investors at the current price range.\n\nOverall, this suggests that the $30k to $31k range is a key area of interest, being the upper level of the largest supply and cost basis cluster. Given relatively few coins transacted on the road from to $35k, this makes the market reaction in the event price returns to $30k of interest. It would also align with the True Market Mean Price we presented in WoC 44 being our best estimate of the average ‘active investor cost basis’.\n\nLive Chart in Glassnode Engine Room\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe Bitcoin supply is historically tight with many supply metrics describing 'coin inactivity' reaching multi-year, and even all-time highs. This suggests that the BTC supply is extremely tightly held, which is impressive given the strong price performance YTD. With the halving expected in April, and positive momentum around a spot ETF in the US, the coming months are shaping up to be exciting ones for Bitcoin investors.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Capital Waterfall\n\nThe digital asset market continues to post impressive relative performance, with both BTC and ETH appreciating meaningfully against USD and gold. However, within the industry, Bitcoin dominance continues to rise, as indicated by several indicators and approaches for observing capital rotation.\n\nGlassnode, Alice Kohn, UkuriaOC, CryptoVizArt, Checkmate\nNov 1, 2023 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe digital asset market has posted impressive returns in 2023, with both BTC and ETH outperforming traditional assets like gold by 93% and 39%, respectively.\nMarket corrections for the two majors have been meaningfully shallower than previous cycles, suggesting a investor support and positive capital inflows are in play.\nOur Altseason indicator has flagged the first meaningful appreciation against USD since the cycle peak. However it is important to note that this is within the context of Bitcoin dominance continuing to rise, with the BTC market cap rising by 110% YTD.\n💡\nAll charts are available within The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nBitcoin prices have rallied over +30% in recent weeks, driven in part by positive progress related to the various Bitcoin ETF applications which are sitting with the SEC for approval. Also of note is the relative performance of BTC and digital assets at large compared to traditional asset classes such as commodities, precious metals, equities and bonds.\n\nIn this edition, we will explore this impressive relative performance of digital assets through 2023. Thus far, both BTC and ETH have out-performed traditional assets significantly, whilst also experiencing shallower drawdowns compared to prior cycles.\n\nRelative Resilience\n\nThe chart below compares BTC and ETH price in gold denomination, demonstrating performance compared to the traditional defensive store of value. BTC has appreciated +93% relative to gold in 2023, whilst ETH is up 39% in gold terms. This strong performance comes amidst increasing global uncertainty, which is likely catching the eye of many traditional investors.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can see that on a rolling 30-day basis, BTC 🟧 and ETH 🟦 returns have been tightly correlated throughout 2023. Both assets have experienced similar magnitude downswings, however Bitcoin has seen stronger performance during upswing periods.\n\nWe can also see the relative volatility of both digital assets exceeds that of Gold (in black), which is trading with smaller price moves in both directions.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe relative strength of digital assets can also be observed by assessing the deepest correction during a macro uptrend. Here we will assess this metric for ETH, as it enables us to see performance relative to USD (an external benchmark), but also compared to the market leader BTC (an internal benchmark).\n\nWe consider the cycle low for ETH/USD as being set in June 2022 following the collapse of 3AC, Celcius and LUNA-UST. Since then, the deepest ETH/USD correction (relative to the local high) has been -44%, set during the failure of FTX. Today, ETH is trading -26% below its 2023 high of $2,118, which is substantially stronger performance than the -60% or larger drawdowns seen in previous cycles.\n\nLive Chart\n\nComparable strength is visible for BTC, with the deepest correction in 2023 being just -20.1%. The 2016-17 bull market saw regular corrections exceeding -25%, whilst 2019 pulled back from the July-2019 high or $14k by over -62%.\n\nFor assessing capital rotation within the digital asset market, a useful reference is to seek periods where ETH out-performs relative to BTC. The chart below shows the depth of the maximum drawdown of the ETH-BTC ratio, compared to the local high of the prevailing uptrend.\n\nPrior cycles have seen ETH drawdown to depths of over -50% on a relative basis during the bear market recovery phase, with the current drawdown reaching -38%. Of particular interest is the duration of this trend, where ETH has depreciated against BTC for over 470-days thus far. This highlights an underlying trend between cycles, where BTC dominance increases over a longer duration in the hangover period after a bear market.\n\nWe can also use this tool to monitor for inflection points in the Risk-on vs Risk-off cycle that we touched on in WoC 41 (and will revisit later in this edition).\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe chart provides another perspective on relative performance, showing oscillators for the rolling Quarterly, Weekly and Weekly ROI of the ETH/BTC Ratio. A barcode indicator (in blue) then highlights periods where all three timeframes are signalling under-performance of ETH relative to BTC.\n\nHere we can see that the recent weakness in the ETH/BTC Ratio is similar to that seen in May-July 2022, with the price ratio having reached the same level of 0.052.\n\nLive Chart\nTrends in Investor Sentiment\n\nDiving deeper into Ethereum price models, we note that ETH is trading at $1,800, which is +22% above the Realized Price ($1,475). The Realized Price is often considered the average cost basis for all coins in the supply, priced at the time when they last transacted.\n\nThis suggests that the average ETH holder is holding a modest degree of profit, however it remains some distance below the extreme price levels often visited during bull market euphoria.\n\nLive Chart\\\n\nAnother way to visualize shifts in investor profitability is via the MVRV Ratio, being the ratio between price and the Realized Price. In this instance, we compare the MVRV Ratio to its 180-day moving average as a tool to monitor trends.\n\nPeriods where the MVRV Ratio trades above this long-term mean indicate investor profitability is increasingly meaningfully, and is often a signal of a rising market. However, despite the positive market performance for ETH YTD, by this metric the market is still experiencing negative momentum. It seems that the hangover from the 2022 bear is still being slowly worked through.\n\nLive Chart\nShifting Confidence\n\nWe can also leverage the relative performance of ETH investor profitability using the Investor Confidence in Trend indicator we developed in WoC 38. The aim is to gauge the tides of shifting sentiment for ethereum investors, constructed by looking at the deviation of the cost basis of two subgroups: holders and spenders.\n\n🟥 Negative Sentiment is when the cost basis of spenders is significantly lower than holders.\n🟩 Positive Sentiment is when the cost basis of the spenders is significantly higher than holders.\n🟧 Transition Sentiment is when the cost basis fluctuates close to the holders cost basis.\n\nBy this measure, the market is within a transitional zone, being positive, but of a relatively small magnitude.\n\nLive Chart\nAltseason In USD...but not in BTC\n\nBuilding on the prior work conducted in the WoC 41, we are able to produce a new iteration for the Altcoin Indicator. In this model, we utilize the previously defined risk-on environment as our first condition, requiring capital inflows into BTC, ETH and Stablecoins. We supplement this with a second condition, being a positive momentum within the Total Altcoin Cap (total crypto cap excluding BTC, ETH and Stablecoins).\n\nHere we look for periods where the aggregate valuation of the Altcoin sector is greater than its 30D SMA. This indictaor flashed positive on 20-Oct, preceding the explosive Bitcoin move from $29.5k to $35.0k.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis heightened level of confidence in digital assets is apparent when assessing the recent performance of the Total Altcoin Market Cap.\n\nThe local move upwards recorded a +21.3% increase in the sector valuation, with only six trading days registering a larger percentage change. This highlights a waterfall effect of investor capital, as rising Bitcoin dominance tends to inspire an uptick in altcoin valuations relative to fiat currencies.\n\nLive Chart\n\nHowever, it is important to recall that Bitcoin dominance is continuing to rise. On a relative basis, BTC now commands over 53% of the digital asset market valuation, with Ethereum, Altcoins at large, and stablecoins all seeing a relative decline in their dominance throughout 2023. Bitcoin dominance has increased from a cyclical low of 38% hit in late 2022.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo close out this perspective, we can compare the YTD increase of the Bitcoin vs Aggregate Altcoin market cap (excl Stablecoins). Bitcoin's market cap has increased by 110% in 2023 compared to Altcoins rising by am impressive, but relatively small 37%.\n\nThis highlights an interesting market dynamic, whereby the altcoin sector are outperforming fiat currencies and traditional assets like Gold, but are meaningfully under-performing Bitcoin.\n\nLive Chart\nConclusion and Summary\n\nThe digital asset market has posted impressive returns in 2023, leaving the initial recovery phase, and moving once again into an uptrend. Market corrections in 2023 for market leaders BTC and ETH have been significantly shallower than in prior cycle uptrends, suggesting a level of investor support and positive capital inflows are taking place.\n\nAcross several indicators, including our developing Altcoin Indicator, we have seen the first substantial increase in altcoin sector market valuations since the last cycle peak. However, it is important to note that this performance is measured relative to fiat currencies, namely the USD. Within the digital asset realm, Bitcoin dominance continues to rise, leading to the BTC market cap increasing by over 110% YTD.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Breath of Fresh Air\n\nBitcoin prices have broken to new yearly highs, trading above the mid-cycle price level of $30k, and reaching $35k. The market found sufficient strength to break above several important psychological pricing levels, making the weeks that follow important to keep an eye on.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nOct 24, 2023 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBitcoin bulls have managed to push BTC prices back to $35k, breaking several key technical and on-chain pricing levels which were co-located around $28k, a noteworthy sign of strength.\nDerivatives markets contributed to the move with a pair of short-squeezes, closing out of 60k BTC worth of futures positions, and a $4.3B surge in options call open interest.\nLong-term investors are unphased by this weeks price action, with Long-Term Holder supply reaching new ATHs, and revived supply volumes remaining insignificant.\n📊\nView all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nBitcoin investors have seen their holdings appreciate meaningfully this week, with BTC rallying from a low of $27.1k to a high of $35.1k. This move started off with a convincing break of several important technical and on-chain pricing levels on the way, making for a noteworthy sign of strength.\n\nA cluster of long-term simple moving averages of price are located around $28k, and have provided market resistance through September and October. After a month of the market grinding higher, the bulls found sufficient strength this week to convincingly break through the 111-day, 200-day, and 200-week averages.\n\nLive Chart\nAre Derivatives The Driver?\n\nWhen significant market moves take place, analysts often consult derivatives data to establish if the move was driven by a leverage wash-out. First we will look at open interest in perpetual swap markets, which we consider in BTC terms to filter out the effects of coin price movement.\n\nOpen interest did decline by around 25k BTC on 17-Oct, which is a reduction of around 8.3%. This was followed by a second major leverage washout of 35k BTC on 23-Oct as the market rallied to new yearly highs of $35k. This leverage squeeze is now of a magnitude similar to the short-squeeze in January, and the long-squeeze in August.\n\nLive Chart\n\nApproximately $56M in short positions were liquidated when the rally kicked off on 17-Oct, and followed by an additional $125M on 23-Oct. This is a meaningful short liquidation volume within the context of 2023. It is again comparable to the $155M in short liquidations in January and the $220M in long positions closed in August.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can inspect futures liquidation volumes another way by taking the 30-day sum of liquidated longs, shorts, and computing the net balance. We can see that most of 2023 (and indeed most history) is dominated by greater long liquidation volumes compared to shorts.\n\nOn net, the market has now seen more short volumes force-closed over the last 30-days. The chart below highlights these points of such 'short-dominance', which have historically coincided with local market extremes.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOf note is that funding rates and cash-and-carry basis in futures markets have remained relatively calm all things considered. 2023 has generally seen futures markets yield annualized rates in excess of 6%, which are greater than US treasury rates.\n\nThe sell-off in August cooled this long bias substantially, with perpetual funding rates dropping from 7.5%+ to +2.5%. Whilst funding rates have spiked during the short squeezes this week, is has remained relatively low, suggesting the rally may be only partially driven leveraged speculation.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOptions markets however continue to be a destination for speculative capital. Open interest in call options has surged by $4.3B, expanding by 80% to reach over $9.7B in total. This suggests that traders and investors continue to use options markets as a preferred instrument for long exposure. This is a relatively new development in Bitcoin market structure, where options markets are now of a comparable scale to futures (see WoC 32).\n\nLive Chart\nTaking Out Key Cost Basis Levels\n\nNot only did this week's rally clear several long term technical analysis price levels, it has also found footing above two important on-chain cost basis models. Analysts can consider these 'cost-basis' models in a similar light to technical levels in that they reflect zones of psychological importance, and thus an area where investor behaviour may shift.\n\nIn our recent Cointime Economics research developed alongside ARK-Invest, we established the True Market Mean Price as an ideal candidate for an average investor cost-basis model. This model is currently trading at $29.78k, and has historically, seen the Bitcoin market trade half its time above, and half below this level.\n\nWith the market having cleared the 2020-22 cycle mid-point (see WoC 28), as well as trading above the True Market Mean Price, this puts the average active BTC investor back into an unrealized profit.\n\n🕰️\nRead more about the Cointime Economics framework for Bitcoin by downloading our full report here.\nLive Chart\n\nThe Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis is also now in the rear view mirror at $28k, putting the average recent investor into an average profit of +20%. The chart below shows the STH-MVRV Ratio, where red denotes periods where the market traded below the STH cost basis, and green above it.\n\nWe can see instances in 2021-22 where STH-MVRV reached relatively deep corrections of -20% or more. Whilst the August sell-off did reach a low of -10%, it is noteworthy how shallow this MVRV decline is by comparison, suggesting the recent correction found noteworthy support, being a precursor to this weeks rally.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhilst MVRV describes the profitability of coins held by Short-Term Holders (unspent supply), it has a sibling indicator called SOPR which describes the profitability of coins that were spent by STHs (spent supply).\n\nWe can similarly compute a 'Spent Cost Basis', to ascertain the average acquisition price for the coins transacted by the STH cohort. In other words, we are assessing the price that spent coins 'came from'.\n\nWe see a similar pattern to MVRV, with a relatively shallow SOPR drawdown compared to 2021-22, and a swing back into positive territory this week. This suggests that investors did not express the same degree of panic and fear as they did in the 2022 bear market proper, another sign of investor resilience.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we bring these two cost basis models together, we can establish an oscillator that tracks the trend of Short-Term Holder confidence (explored further in WoC 38).\n\nWhat we can see is that after hitting the most negative value since January (when prices were ~$16k), investor confidence has recovered to neutral, meaning STHs who are spending have a similar cost basis to those who are HODLing. We are also on the verge of a positive cross-over of these cost basis models.\n\nLive Chart\nHow Did Long-Term Investors React?\n\nThe final question we will address is how longer-term investors have reacted to this rally, and how their aggregate positioning has changed.\n\nWith the market approaching YTD highs, a significant proportion of the supply has now recovered from being held 'in-loss' to 'in-profit'. The percent of supply in profit jumped by a massive 4.7M BTC, equivalent to 24% of the total circulating supply. This provides insight into the volume of coins which changed hands, and have a cost basis between $27k and $35k.\n\nWith 81% of the supply now in profit, the market has now returned to positive gear, with this metric now being above the long-term average for this metric (shown in green).\n\nLive Chart\n\nFor the Long-Term Holder cohort, they appear impressively unaffected by this weeks rally, seeing their aggregate holdings break to a new all-time-high of 14.899M BTC. The continued climb of this metric indicates that a larger volume of supply is maturing across the 155-day holding threshold than is being spent out of it.\n\nApproximately 29.6% of LTH Supply is held at a loss, which is actually historically high for this metric given the strong market uptrend since the 2022 lows. This is similar to late 2015 and early 2019, and the March 2020 bottom.\n\nThis suggests that the LTH cohort may well be a more hardened and firm handed cohort compared to prior cycles.\n\nLive Chart\n\nLastly, we will look at a Z-Score (2yr period) transformation of the Revived Supply metric. We are seeking periods where coins which have been held for longer than 1yr are spent at a statistically significant rate compared to the prior 2-yrs (half a halving cycle).\n\nPeriods of high expenditure (green) often correlate with maximum profit taking (uptrends) or panic selling (downtrends). However today, this metric suggests we remain within a regime of coin dormancy, with a negative z-score reading, indicative of minimal volumes of revived supply reacting to this week's events.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nBitcoin prices have reached new yearly highs, breaking back above the mid-cycle price level of $30k, and accelerating to $35k. The market found sufficient strength to break above several important pricing levels including the 200-day average, 200-week average (both technical), True Market Mean Price, and Short-Term Holder cost basis (both on-chain).\n\nA meaningful proportion of supply and investors now find themselves above the average break-even price, located around $28k. This sets the foundation for a resumption of the 2023 uptrend. At the very least, the market has crossed over several key levels where aggregate investor psychology is likely to be anchored, making the weeks that follow important to keep an eye on.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Cycle of Bitcoin Changing Hands\n\nCapital rotation within digital assets markets occurs both between assets, as well as internally as coins change hands at different acquisition prices. In this edition, we develop two indicators based off the Realized Cap and NUPL to track this rotation of capital between investors.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nOct 17, 2023 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nCapital rotation in digital asset markets occurs both between assets (as covered last week), but also internally as coins change hands and trade between investors.\nWe develop a tool utilizing the Realized Cap HODL waves to track the rotation of capital from longer-term investors to speculators (and back again).\nWe couple this with a second indicator designed from NUPL variants, with both indicators helping to map out where the market is relative to past distribution cycles.\n📊\nView all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nTraditional equity and commodity markets tend to rely on Market Cap as the primary valuation tool for an asset. In digital asset markets, we have an alternative metric derived from on-chain data known as the Realized Cap (more in this report). The realized cap aggregates the acquisition cost for each unit in the supply at the time it last changed hands. This in turn offers superior signal, and a more reliable approximation of the capital invested in an asset.\n\nIn this edition, we will continue our exploration of the capital rotation theme in digital asset markets (see last weeks WoC 41). However this week, we will shift our focus internally, and review the process of how coins change hands within the Bitcoin holder-base as market cycles progress.\n\nThe chart below compares the market cap and realized cap for Bitcoin. Only during the deepest drawdowns of bear markets has the market cap dropped below the realized cap. Other than these extremely painful intervals, the majority of market history involves market cap trading above the realized cap, suggesting the market holds an unrealized profit in aggregate.\n\nThe market cap traded below the realized cap for a 6-month period in the second half of 2022, and has since recovered to a value of $524B, compared to a realized cap of $396B.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe realized cap tends to plateau, or drawdown slightly during bear markets, as coins change hands and are revalued to lower acquisition prices. During this process, they gradually migrate towards longer-term investor wallets where they start to mature (remaining dormant for longer periods of time).\n\nThis trend can be illustrated via the Realized HODL Waves, showing shifts in wealth distribution by age cohort (as a percent of realized cap). This tool visualizes the shifting supply and demand forces in the market, as capital rotates between investors.\n\n🔵 During market uptrends older coins are spent and transferred from long-term holders to newer investors (warmer bands expand, cooler bands contract).\n🔴 During market downtrends speculators lose interest and gradually transfer coins to longer-term holders (cooler bands expand, warmer bands contract).\n\nCurrently, the market has reached an equilibrium between these two investor groups, with a slightly positive inflow of newer investors entering the market (demand side). This resembles the conditions seen in both 2016 and 2019, where the market was attempting to recover from a significant bear market drawdown.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can also isolate individual age bands to identify groups that best correspond with capital rotation between short and long-term investors.\n\nFirst will look at age bands which are generally insensitive to market cycles, which are typically coins dormant for at least 3-years. This can be justified by noting this cohort hold a relatively small (<5%) share of the total wealth held in Bitcoin. Most coins in this group fall into the 3y-5y range, suggesting they were acquired during the 2018-20 period.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nNext, we will consider the cycle-sensitive subset of longer-term investors whom were active during the 2020-23 cycle. These coins are aged 6m-3y old, and the holdings of this cohort historically reaches maximums and minimums aligned with bear market lows, and bull market highs, respectively.\n\nThe peak of capital held within in the 1-2 year age band 🟢 often aligns with the deepest points of a bear market when rates of accumulation by high conviction holders is highest, working to establish a market floor. Conversely, capital held by this cohort reaches a minimum near bull market tops, as they exert maximum distribution pressure and eventually overwhelm inflowing demand.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nLastly, we look at the youngest age band cohorts attributed to short-term investors and speculators. These bands are more closely related to the inflow of demand, being the actively traded coins that have recently changed hands. These age bands move inversely to the 6m-3y cohort, swelling during uptrends (new buyers), and compressing during bear markets as interest and activity in the asset wanes.\n\nWe note that the <1-month cohort is particularly responsive, and is a suitable opposing counterpart to the 1y-2y band to approximate the 'middle' behaviour of these two groups.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can now synthesise this capital rotation process into two dominant cohorts which tend to drive the market:\n\nShort-Term Indicator [<1 month] 🔴 The realized capital or wealth portion moved in the last 30 days. This cohort corresponds closely to the demand side, including new investors deploying fresh capital into the market.\nLong-Term Indicator [1-2 years]🔵 This portion of the supply peaks during the bear market bottom formation phase. This cohort represents the long-term and price insensitive investors that accumulated during, and held throughout the bear market.\n\nDuring bear markets, the long-term indicator swells and holds more than 15% of the BTC capital (and also trades well above the short-term indicator). This structure illustrates the dominance of accumulation/holding conviction in the market.\n\nThis dynamic ends when new capital flows into the market, providing exit liquidity for long-term holders, and pushing the short-term indicator higher (and above the long-term indicator). This pattern describes an expansion of buy side pressure as prices rally and attract attention in the bull market.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nTo conclude this study, we can measure the difference between these two indicators (1y-2y minus <1m) to map out the market's current status based on the capital rotation between long-term (supply) and short-term (demand) players.\n\nThis Inter-Cycle Capital Rotation Ratio 🟪 is displayed below, and is currently trading at a level of 13%, which is similar to levels seen in 2016 and 2019. This indicates that the Bitcoin supply remains strongly dominated by the HODLer cohort, with a super-majority of coins now being older than 6-months.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nSizing Up Investor Pain\n\nNow that we have mapped out ‘time’ component of capital rotation, we will dedicate the second part of this report to modelling this across another dimension, being the financial pressure on existing investors. We will leverage on-chain cost basis models for three cohorts:\n\nShort-Term Holders 🔴\nLong-Term Holders 🔵\nMarket-wide 🟠\n\nAs the spot price deviates meaningfully above or below each cohort’s average cost basis, we can consider this as a growing incentive to take profits, or panic sell when their position is underwater, respectively.\n\nThe chart below shows periods where the spot price trades below the cost basis of all three cohorts, depicting a zone of acute financial pain across the market.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nAnother tool to quantify the unrealized losses is using the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric. This tool will indicate when a particular cohort is holding unrealized losses (NUPL<0) or unrealized profits (NUPL>0) on average.\n\nBoth the wider market, and the Long-Term Holder NUPL are currently positive, indicating the average investor is in profit. For Short-Term Holders however, their cost basis sits at $27.8k, resulting in STH-NUPL trading just slightly above neutral. These active investors are near their break-even level, suggesting that he $28k level is an important decision point for the market.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nIn a similar manner to the Realized Cap HODL wave analysis above, we will again take the difference between the long-term and short-term NUPL metrics to compare the financial pressure (or profit incentive) between these cohorts.\n\nThis NUPL Ratio 🟪 provides an insightful indicator for navigating market cycles based on the bias in the Existing Supply (Long-Term Investors) vs New Demand (Short-Term Investors) components. The NUPL Ratio has entered the -0.25 range in Q3 2023, which is similar again to the 2016 and 2019 periods, and typical of a bear market recovery phase.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nConclusion\n\nIn this report we expanded on the theme of capital rotation, however this time focused on the cons changing hands within the Bitcoin holder-base. We utilize the powerful set of tools available within the age bands of the Realized Cap, and isolated sub-groups thatbest describe capital rotation throughout the cycle.\n\nBy measuring the difference between the wealth held by long-term and short-term investors, we can model the ebb and flow of supply and demand forces. From this, we can see that the current market structure very much resembles the recovery phase from a major bear market, with similarities to both 2016 and 2019.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

In this edition we assess the activity of both the On and Off-chain environment, and produce a new framework to help identify peak Altseason regimes.\n\nGlassnode, UkuriaOC\nOct 10, 2023 • 6 min read\nIntroduction\nThe On-Chain landscape remains extremely illiquid with waning capital flows, low network settlement and HODLing remaining the primary dynamic.\nOff-Chain, Exchange activity also remains significantly quiet when measuring from the lens of volume, profit and loss, highlighting the lack of exchange interaction across all cohorts.\nWe introduce a new model to assess both Risk-On and Risk-Off environments, and to identify periods of extreme Altseason Mania through the framework of capital rotation.\n📊\nView all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nDormant Coins\n\nWe shall start with an evaluation of the current structure of the Realized Cap. Following a brief and modest period of capital inflows to Bitcoin through the first half of the year, the Realized Cap has stabilized, reaching a point of relative indecision.\n\nAs the Realized Cap trades sideways, it suggests that very few coins transferred on-chain are experiencing a significant net change in their acquisition price (i.e. minimal profit or loss taking events).\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can see this from the perspective of Long-Term Holder Supply, which continues to reach new all-time-highs over 14.859M BTC. This is equivalent to 76.1% of the circulating supply which has not transacted in the last 5-months.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe HODLer Net Position Change metric tells a similar story, where the market is experiencing a sustained regime of coin dormancy. Over +50k BTC per month are currently being Vaulted by HODLers, suggesting both a tightening supply, and a widespread reluctance to transact.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nSupply Tightens\n\nThis observation is reinforced by an assessment the the Average BTC Volume Transferred per Active Entity, which has fallen to a value of $12.2k (approx 0.44 BTC). This metric has returned to levels seen in late 2017 (end of the bull run) and again in late 2020 (prior to the last cycle bull run).\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nThis lull in market liquidity is strikingly apparent when evaluating the ‘Hot Supply’ metric, being the volume of coins which have transacted within the last week. To demonstrate just how quiet the Bitcoin supply is, we compare Hot Supply to its long-term mean minus 0.5 standard deviations.\n\nFrom this, we construct a framework to highlights periods of low and contracting market liquidity, where Hot Supply is below this Mean - 0.5SD level. These highlighted areas show that the current liquidity conditions remain similar to the 2014-15 and 2018-19 bear markets, having been in this condition for 535-days.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe volume of Illiquid Supply is also climbing, moving in the opposite direction to aggregate Exchange Balances.\n\nThis divergence is another piece of evidence that coins continue to be withdrawn from exchanges, moving into illiquid HODLer owned wallets, where they are generally ageing into Long-Term Holder status.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nExchanges\n\nWe have established that the on-chain BTC supply remains exceptionally dormant, with both value transferred and the influx of new capital being historically muted. With Exchanges remaining the primary venues for trade, we can profile flows in and out as a gauge for investor activity.\n\nThe 30-day and 365-day average of total exchange volumes (inflows plus outflows) is hovering around $1.5B, which is a substantial decline (75.5%) relative to the ATH of $6B set in May 2021.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nThe volume of Profit and Loss realized by coins sent to Exchange Addresses has also experienced a complete detox from the 2021-22 cycle, with both measures hitting the lowest levels seen since 2020.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nThe average Profit or Loss realized per coin has also reached cycle lows, reinforcing the observation that the majority of coins being traded were last transacted at a similar price to today. We also note that profits are equal to losses, suggesting a state of equilibrium has been reached (an indicator for heightened volatility ahead).\n\nWith the majority of coins transacting in close proximity to their original cost basis, this describes a market where active investors are either price insensitive HODLers, or traders jostling for a marginally better position.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nModelling Altseason\n\nWith so little occurring on-chain, this next section will explore a more fundamental concept, being the rotation of capital which often referred to as ‘alt-season’. From this we will construct a novel tool to assess periods where ‘alt-season’ capital rotation appears to be underway.\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin tends to lead the digital asset market, with market confidence then flowing towards Ethereum, and then further out on the risk curve from there.\n\nA powerful tool to visualise this capital rotation is using the 30-day change in the Realized Cap for 🟠 BTC and 🔵 ETH, and the total supply of 🟢 Stablecoins (as a proxy for USD quote capital, often deployed for speculation).\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nIn order to normalize these net position change metrics, we convert this 30-day change to a relative percentage of the Realized Cap (BTC and ETH) or total supply (Stablecoins).\n\nNext, we construct a simple model to identify whether the market is within a risk-on, or a risk-off environment, respectively:\n\n🟢 Risk-on is defined when all three of these major assets are exhibiting net capital inflows.\n🔴 Risk-off is defined if any of the three major assets starts to exhibit net capital outflows.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWith this broad view of risk on/off environments defined, we can apply one more constraint to filter for periods of explosive Altseason mania within a primary uptrend. With all three majors exhibiting positive capital flows, we then filter only for events where capital is rotating towards to Ethereum and Stablecoins.\n\nThis model is accomplished by looking for a positive and increasing 30-day change in the ETH Realized Cap and Stablecoin Total Supply (i.e a positive second derivative). This model simulates the waterfall effect of capital rotating from larger caps, into small caps.\n\nThe conditions are as follows:\n\nRisk on remains when all three majors are exhibiting capital inflows\nPeak Risk on ‘Altseason Mania’ is defined where the capital flows into both Ethereum and Stablecoins is positive and increasing.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nFor a sanity check, we can compare this indicator to the 30-day change in Bitcoin Dominance where we note that peaks in this altcoin mania indicator also align with large reductions in Bitcoin Market Cap Dominance.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nAs a final comparison, we can compare it to the Swissblock Altcoin Cycle Signal, where we can see similar peaks (value of 100) in the indicator aligned with capital rotation towards Ethereum and Stablecoins.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nLiquidity continues to dry up across the digital assets as network settlement, Exchange interaction and capital flows reside at cycle lows, heavily underscoring the current acute apathy experienced by the market.\n\nThe Long-Term Holder cohort remains resolute as their supply continues to ascend to new ATHs whilst HODLer Growth remains robust, tightening the active tradeable supply.\n\nDespite large fluctuations in valuation for Altcoins, a symptom of the prevailing low liquidity environment, our new Altcoin framework which simulates the waterfall effect of capital rotation suggests a Risk On regime is not in play, providing confluence to the lack of liquidity available to digital assets.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "Ethereum and DeFi\nstETH's Effect on Ethereum\n\nLiquid staking transforms the supply dynamics of ETH and creates a shift in the demand for Ethereum's native token. stETH becomes particularly attractive on lending platforms, while stETH liquidity on decentralized exchanges diminishes.\n\nGlassnode, Alice Kohn\nOct 3, 2023 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe rise of liquid staking has reshaped the Ethereum supply composition and the dynamics of ETH emission, with a notable presence of Lido driving these dynamics.\nWe are witnessing an upward trend in the adoption of stETH, especially when contrasted with ETH, which has experienced a stagnation in demand.\nstETH has taken over from ETH as the preferred asset on lending platforms. This shift is mainly propelled by the appeal of leveraged stETH positions, which seem to offer more attractive yields compared to providing liquidity through stETH-ETH pairs on decentralized exchanges.\n📊\nView all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nLiquid Staking on the Rise\n\nSince the introduction of the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism to the Ethereum network, a new phenomenon has emerged: Liquid staking.\n\nIn essence, liquid staking projects enable individuals to delegate their ETH to the project’s node operators, who in turn stake the ETH on their behalf. In return, the individuals receive a representation of their staked ETH known as Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) or Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs).\n\nIn the context of these new developments, the composition of the circulating ETH supply has changed. Currently, 23% of the ETH supply is staked, with 32% of that being staked via the largest liquid staking service provider, Lido. This also means that 7% of the ETH supply is being replaced by Lido’s staking derivative, stETH. This shift is showing a rising tendency.\n\n💡\nNote: This report is experimenting with interactive charts which may need just a few extra moments to load than usual. They can also be expanded by clicking the square icon in the bottom right corner.\n\nUsually, staked ETH serves as security for validators and is locked up. However, liquid staking derivatives allow users to reuse their staked ETH, for example in DeFi protocols, while still receiving staking rewards. These derivatives are backed by the equivalent amount of staked ETH, and can be redeemed through the liquid staking platform at any time.\n\nThis appealing feature of liquid staking is the driving force behind the current trend of increased staking through liquid staking providers, with Lido currently dominating the field with an 86% market share. We therefore continue this analysis by evaluating Lido's staking derivatives stETH and its wrapped version, wstETH.\n\nstETH's Impact on ETH Supply\n\nSince the merge, the issuance of newly created ETH is solely generated from the rewards paid out to validators.\n\nAs Lido owns 32% of the staking pool, they subsequently receive 32% of the validator's rewards, and consequently, 32% of the newly created ETH is distributed into the ETH economy via Lido. To understand the impact this might have for the ETH supply, we should take a closer inspection at Lido's reward mechanisms. Lido's reward structure consists of three layers:\n\n🟠 Consensus Layer Rewards in the form of rewards paid on top of the staked ETH account for the largest portion of the protocol rewards at 68.8%\n🔴 MEV rewards are a form of extra fee for being included in a certain position within a block and are the second largest at 28.4%.\n🔵 Priority Fees paid for transacting on the network constitute the remaining 3.72% of rewards.\n\nThe gross annual percentage rate for Lido is determined by the overall consensus layer APR and the execution layer APR, which are based on the rewards received by Lido validators in relation to the total pooled Ether. As of writing, the total Protocol APR is 4.07%.\n\nLido charges a 10% fee on staking rewards with the fee split between both the node operators and the protocol's treasury. This applies to both execution layer rewards and consensus layer rewards.\n\nWhen considering Lido's consensus layer reward distribution in terms of the 32% of the newly created ETH, we observe a different emission dynamic compared to what was envisioned by the Ethereum protocol. Unlike solo stakers who receive all validator rewards, and hence newly created ETH, Lido only distributes 1.6% of the newly created ETH to node operators (assuming they are not holders of stETH). Another 1.6% goes into the Lido Treasury, whilst 28.8% is distributed to stETH holders.\n\nFurthermore, Lido compounds the rewards earned by validators, by restaking the rewards earned from Priority Fees and MEV. Currently, around 104k ETH has been restaked, which contributes to a compounding effect of 1.24% of the Protocol APR.\n\nLido's compounding strategy offsets parts of the ETH emission through the Consensus Layer Rewards. While 3.2% of the rewards are distributed as described above, an additional 0.95% of the total rewards are locked away in the staking pool. In total, this amounts to Lido receiving a total of 221k in newly created ETH (see previous chart), whilst 105k ETH is locked again in the staking pool, resulting in net emission of 116k ETH.\n\nstETH's Impact on ETH Demand\n\nLido mints stETH for every ETH staked with its node operators, as well as for the rewards received from staking activities. All stETH holders receive an automatic update of their the account based on the rewards they are eligible to making stETH a yield-bearing version of ETH. Due to the attractiveness stETHs yield-bearing properties compared to ETH, there are beliefs circulating that stETH could replace ETH as Ethereum's reserve currency.\n\nTo determine if Lido's stETH is tapping into the demand for ETH, we examine the recent adoption of both ETH and its wrapped version, WETH, in comparison to stETH and its wrapped version, wstETH. By comparing the trends using a 30D-SMA, we observe that the number of new addresses using ETH + WETH has stalled since the Terra Luna Collapse in May 2022, whilst demand for stETH + wstETH has increased by 142% during the same period.\n\nWhen observing the transfer volume, a similar trend can be noted with both ETH + WETH, experiencing an increase in volume ranging from $6B to $10B on average throughout 2022. However, this volume flattened out at the beginning of 2023.\n\nConversely, stETH reached a peak volume in the spring of 2022 and remained relatively stable for the rest of the year. However, in 2023, it gained momentum again, jumping from $127M, to a range of $450M - $880M.\n\nstETH's Impact on DeFi\n\nWhen comparing the usage of ETH and stETH in DeFi, we shall primarily focus on the wrapped alternatives of both tokens as proxy for demand due to their support in the majority of DeFi applications.\n\nSince the beginning of 2022, a significant increase in the supply of the wstETH can be observed, with an additional 3M+ tokens issued. This suggests a growing preference amongst users to hold wstETH instead of stETH.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that only 70.5% of the wstETH supply is held in smart contracts. The large number of individual wstETH holders can be attributed to tax regulations. With the automatic balance updates of stETH being seen as taxable income, users may prefer to hold the wrapped version that only increases in value without increasing the number of tokens.\n\nIn comparison, wETH supply has decreased by 62% within the same period, indicating a lack of demand for the wrapped version of ETH. This provides confluence with the observation of reduced usage of wETH in smart contracts.\n\nWhen analyzing the breakdown of stETH supply into its token holders, whilst taking into account that wstETH replaces 74% of the stETH supply, we can observe that Lido's staking derivative has found significant adoption within Aave's lending protocol. Approximately 14.4% of the stETH and 25.3% of the wstETH supply are utilized in Aave.\n\nOf note, only a small percentage of Lido's staking derivative is being used on decentralized exchanges (DEX). Among the DEXes, Curve holds the highest amount of stETH liquidity, which represents a mere 1.4% of the total stETH supply.\n\nThis is a concerning number, considering that stETH and wstETH are traded primarily on DEXes. In this context, we reiterate the points raised in the previous Week on Chain 27 regarding the receeding liquidity of stETH.\n\nAs depicted in the charts below, Curve, the largest trading venue for stETH, has experienced a 90.2% decrease in stETH reserves for the top three stETH pools since May 2022.\n\nConcurrently, Aave has experienced an influx of Lido's staked ETH, with an increase of approximately 53.6%. The stETH reserves have been evenly divided between the two versions of Aave. This transition is likely be driven by the fact that leveraged stETH positions offer more attractive yields compared to providing liquidity for stETH on DEXes.\n\nThe shift from DEXes to lending platforms like Aave has reduced liquidity for stETH, which potentially poses risks in terms of stETH depegging as well as the creation of bad debt on Aave. This is because the liquidity available on DEXes may not be sufficient for the liquidation of these loans.\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nThe rise of liquid staking has brought about significant changes in the composition of the Ethereum (ETH) supply and the dynamics of newly created ETH. Lido, a major player in the staking pool, has altered the flow of new ETH entering the economy through its restaking strategy.\n\nFurthermore, a portion of the newly minted ETH is distributed to sETH holders, who may exhibit different characteristics and behavior patterns compared to validators. Which leads to the assumption that a notable portion of the newly minted ETH from Lido is being directed towards DeFi applications\n\nThis shift has also seen stETH replace ETH in Aave, presumably due to leveraged stETH positions offering higher yields than providing liquidity with stETH-ETH pairs on decentralized exchanges. This development carries the potential risk of stETH losing its peg to the underlying asset and could also lead to challenges related to handling bad debt on Aave.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nInscriptions, Mempools and Miners\n\nInscriptions have been a significant buyer of Bitcoin blockspace since their introduction in Feb 2023. In this edition, we explore whether inscriptions are displacing monetary transfers, and how the increase in fees has impacted miner profitability.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nSep 26, 2023 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nInscriptions act as a form of buyer of last resort for cheap blockspace, and appear to be sensitive to the absolute fee paid.\nInscriptions are best thought of as a sort of 'packing filler' which is stuffed into any remaining space once the higher value monetary transfers are packed into blocks.\nAnalysis of fees and volume need to consider that there can be a higher perception of 'value' assigned to the inscriptions beyond the BTC volume being transferred and held.\nDespite a meaningful uptick in fee revenue for miners, the halving event is likely to put many of them into extreme income stress unless BTC prices increase meaningfully.\n📊\nView all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nFull Mempools\n\nInscriptions have been a major consumer of Bitcoin blockspace since their introduction in Feb 2023. In this edition, we will explore how Inscriptions have changed the landscape of on-chain activity, Mempools, and miner revenues, and what it may look like on the road ahead.\n\nThe 'Bitcoin mempool' can be thought of as a cloud of unconfirmed transactions which are all awaiting inclusion in a block by miners. Every Bitcoin node actually has its own unique mempool, defined by both the rules set by the node operator, but also by the transactions that it 'knows about' from the peer-to-peer gossip network.\n\nThe chart below shows the data size of the highest fee paying transactions in the Glassnode mempool over the last year. Of note is the significant uptick in blockspace demand which started in February, aligned with the release of Ordinals and Inscriptions. This elevated demand has been sustained ever since.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhilst our mempool has been 'data-full' since February, we can see that the number of pending transactions has actually increased significantly since May. This indicates that a majority of these unconfirmed transactions have a very small data-footprint (more transactions fit within the 300MB capacity of the Glassnode mempool).\n\nLive Chart\n\nInscriptions allow Bitcoin users to encode files into the witness portion of the transaction data structure. The chart below shows that there have been two waves of inscriptions thus far:\n\n🟠 Wave 1: Images and files, dominated as users used the Ordinal protocol to create Bitcoin native NFTs, and explore the new technology.\n🔵 Wave 2: Text dominated, as the experimental BRC-20 token emerged using text based JSON files to define asset minting and transfers.\n\nThe explosion of text based inscriptions aligns clearly with the uptick in pending transactions within our mempool. This confirms that these small size text inscriptions have become a significant source of demand for blockspace.\n\nLive Chart\n\nInscriptions take advantage of the split data structure introduced with SegWit, making it possible fit more transactions in the same 4M Wu capped blocksize. Until inscriptions gained popularity, the maximum number of (mainly monetary) transactions which could be fit into a block tended to peak at around 375k to 400k/day, usually hit in bull markets.\n\n2023 however saw and incredible uptick in daily confirmed transaction counts, breaching 550k per day both in May, and again this week.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA similar pattern can be seen in the average number of confirmed transactions per block. In prior years where monetary transfers were the primary use of Bitcoin blockspace, full blocks typically contained between 2.25k and 2.50k transactions.\n\nIn 2023 however, that ceiling has been taken out, with the additional space available in the witness data allowing for the average block to contain between 2.80k and 3.50k transactions (with daily spikes even reaching over 4.0k per block).\n\nLive Chart\n\nOut of all confined transactions, text based inscriptions account for between 40% and up to 60% of all transactions since May. This dwarfs the first wave of image dominant inscriptions which typically represented just 7.5% of all transactions.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOne notable impact of inscriptions is a rapidly expanding UTXO set. Since February, the total number of UTXOs in the set has increased by +46.2M (+33.8%). This is the largest rate of weekly increase in history, sustaining levels between 300k to 450k UTXOs/wk for the over six months.\n\nOf note is the BRC-20 token called SATS, which was launched in March, but only finished minting out this week. This token alone is responsible for at least 21M new UTXOs, around 45.5% of the increase. It remains to be seen whether mempools start to clear now that this multi-month token mint has completed.\n\nLive Chart\nInscriptions Are Buyers of Last Resort\n\nThe percent of blockspace consumed by Image vs Text based inscriptions is almost the exact inverse of the share of transactions. The first wave of Image inscriptions routinely consumed a fairly large 40%+ of the available blockspace. The second wave of text inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens on the other hand has consumed a relatively stable 20% or less, reflecting their smaller data footprint.\n\nThis is quite an interesting observation, as it suggests that these text based inscriptions are acting somewhat like 'filler' for blocks.\n\nBy way of analogy, think about a Bitcoin block as a moving crate:\n\nMonetary transfers and Image inscriptions represent the the contents of the crate and are fewer in number, but consume the majority of the crate volume and value.\nText inscriptions on the other hand represent a soft newspaper packing which can be stuffed into any remaining space, but on the whole consumes relatively little volume and value.\nLive Chart\n\nThis analogy is further reinforced by the share of fees paid by Inscriptions. Here we can see that both waves hit a ceiling of around 20% of transaction fees being attributed to inscriptions.\n\nSince Bitcoin transaction fees are paid on a per-data basis (fee per byte), inscriptions tend to be relatively sensitive to the size of the absolute fee. As such, inscription users have tended to set relatively low fee rates, expressing a willingness to wait longer periods of time for confirmation.\n\nInscriptions appear to be buying and consuming the cheapest available blockspace, and are readily displaced by more urgent monetary transfers.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can see this by comparing the Mean and Median transfer volumes:\n\n🔴 Mean Transfer Volumes are more representative of monetary transfers. We can see that the average tends to follow bull and bear cycles, with consistently higher peaks and troughs over time (currently at $36k).\n🔵 Median Transfer Volumes are more representative of smaller investors (historically) and in more recent times, inscriptions (in 2023).\n\nNote how the median transfer volume have waterfall collapsed to just $7.30 this year. This is a direct result of inscriptions becoming a dominant transaction type, which are numerous (hence affecting ther median), and transported on a very small BTC volume of just a few hundred to thousand sats (usually less than 0.0001000 BTC ~ $2.60) .\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also see this dynamic through the lens of Fee Paid per Unit Transferred. The average transaction fee is typically between 0.001% and 0.01% of the volume spent, which is an intuitive and expected result.\n\nFor Median fee rates however, we see that high urgency transactions have been willing to pay up to 1.2% fees during bull market peaks, as the market entered a state of euphoria. In 2023, we have seen this translate across to inscriptions, where fees as high as 10% and even over 50%+ of the value transferred becoming increasingly common.\n\nThis reflects a willingness to pay a priority fee based on the perceived value of the inscription, and less so relative to the small ~10k sats in value which is transferred.\n\nLive Chart\nDo Inscriptions Impact Miner Incomes?\n\nNaturally, as blockspace demand increases, miner revenues will be positively affected. Whilst the fee spike in May was historically large, it has since cooled off, and both total fees and their relative share of miner income remain relatively low.\n\nBoth metrics have lifted above their typical 'bear market' levels; total fees have increased by 216% from ~12 BTC/day to 38 BTC/day, and the the proportion of the miner income from fees has increased from 1% to 4%. Both are meaningful increases, however are still small in an absolute and historical context.\n\nLive Chart\n\nMeanwhile, the amount of hashrate competing for these rewards has increased by 50% since February, as more miners, and newer ASIC rigs are established and come online.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis has driven the hashprice, being the BTC or USD reward earned per Exahash, towards new all-time-lows. Miners will now earn just 2.26 BTC (~$60k) per Exahash active on the network.\n\nThe endless logarithmic descent of hashprice shows just how cut-throat and unforgiving the mining industry is.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn a prior study, we attempted to estimate the average all-in cost of production for BTC via a regression model between Market Cap and difficulty. Based on this model, the average miner acquisition price is around $24.3k, which is less than a 10% premium to the current spot price.\n\nThis suggests that miners may be on the brink of becoming unprofitable, especially with the halving event now an estimated 206-days away.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAnother approach to estimating the cost of BTC production is via relative issuance to difficulty. By this model, we estimate that the most efficient miners on the network have an acquisition price of around $15.1k.\n\nHowever, the purple curve shows the post-halving 'doubling' of this level to $30.2k, which would likely put the majority oif the mining market into severe income stress.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWith inscriptions now having several months of history to study, we find that they act as a sort of 'packing-filler' for blocks. There is minimal evidence that inscriptions are displacing monetary transfers, instead acting as a buyer of last resort for cheap blockspace.\n\nWhilst this has improved the base-load demand for blockspace, and increased fee revenue meaningfully, the hashrate competing for it is also up over 50% since February. With extreme miner competition in play, and the halving event looming, it is likely that miners are on the edge of income stress, with their profitability to be tested unless BTC prices increase in the near term.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nInvestor Confidence Slides\n\nWith almost all Short-Term Holders now underwater on their position, sentiment has shifted towards the negative. In this report, we explore several measures to track investor sentiment. We develop indicators which assess divergences between the market and observed investor behavior.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nSep 18, 2023 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nWe review the market position relative to two on-chain pricing models, both of which are intersected during past cycle lows, and in the March 2020 sell-off.\nPatterns of accumulation and distribution tend to align with local highs and lows, and we demonstrate how this plays out in on-chain data.\nA super-majority of Short-Term Holders are now underwater on their position, with a new indicator suggesting negative sentiment dominates this cohort at present.\nFinding Floors\n\nThe Bitcoin market continues to languish around $26k, after prices failed to hold above the cycle midpoint level at around $31.4k. Both attempts in April and July effectively set a double top pattern in prices. Amongst other indicators related to Short-Term Holders covered last week (WoC 37), this may suggest the market is experiencing an early stage shift in market psychology and confidence.\n\nThe chart below presents two pricing models:\n\n🟢 Investor Price ($17.6k) which reflects the average acquisition price for all coins excluding those acquired by miners (i.e. in secondary markets).\n🟣 Delta Price ($11.1k) which is a combined on-chain and technical pricing model, often used to model cycle floors.\n\nPrice action across both the 2018-19 and 2022-23 cycles spent a similar amount of time trading within the bounds of these price models at the lows. Of note is that the market revisited the Investor Price level during the chaos of the March 2020 sell-off.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: A suite of both technical and on-chain pricing models are available within the Pricing Model Dashboard for Bitcoin.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nIn addition to the duration spent between these models, we can also measure the compression and expansion between these price models as a gauge for the market recovery. The distance between these models will compress near cycle tops as large volumes of capital flow into the market. Conversely, divergence indicates a softer inflow of capital, where declining prices becomes the driving factor.\n\nThis model can be used to monitor the transition from the deepest phase of a bear market back towards a market recovery. From this we can see that the prevailing market structure is similar in nature to the the decompression phase seen in 2016, and also in 2019.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nCapital Rotation Cycles\n\nThe Realized HODL Ratio (RHODL) is a market indicator that tracks the balance of invested wealth held within recently moved coins (<1-week) and more mature HODLers (1-2 years). In the next chart, we have applied a 2-year (half cycle) Median 🔵 as a threshold value for periods where capital flow regimes transition between bull and bear market structure.\n\nWe can see that by this measure, 2023 has seen a modest influx of new investors, however, the RHODL Ratio is only just contesting with the 2-year median level. The influx of new investors is positive but relatively weak in momentum.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can also visualize this positive but soft inflow of capital by leveraging the Accumulation Trend Score. This tool reflects the relative balance change of active investors over the past 30 days.\n\nHere we can see that the 2023 recovery rally was fuelled by significant accumulation into the local tops above $30k. This describes a degree of FOMO 🔴 by investors. This is in contrast to capitulation events in the second half of 2022, where new investors seized the opportunity and accumulated at the lows 🟢.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nZooming into this behaviour near recent market tops, we can use the Realized Profit and Loss indicators to assess sudden changes in investor profitability. Realized profit and loss metrics measure the change in the the value of all spent coins, comparing the value at disposal to the value at acquisition. The chart below shows the weekly sum of realized profit 🟩 and loss 🟥, normalized by Market Cap to compare across cycles.\n\nHere, we can see that a confluence emerges between these periods of intense accumulation, and elevated profit-taking. Both were present at the local tops in 2023, and a similar confluence exists at the 2021 market peaks in Jan and Dec.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nUnderwater Holders\n\nIn last week's edition, we reviewed a set of metrics exploring how a significant proportion of Short-Term Holders are now holding coins at a loss, shown below as a percentage of STH Supply in Profit 🔵.\n\nDuring bear markets, when more than 97.5% of the supply acquired by new investors are at loss 🟥, the chance of seller exhaustion increases exponentially. On the other hand, when more than 97.5% of short-term holder supply is in profit, these players tend to take advantage of the opportunity and exit at break-even or with a profit 🟩.\n\nDuring the rally above $30k, this metric reached complete profit saturation for the first time since the Nov-2021 all-time high. However, since selling off below $26k in recent weeks, more than 97.5% of STH supply is now held at a loss, being the deepest level since FTX collapsed.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nWith so many Short-Term Holders now underwater, we can assess their position using two powerful metrics:\n\nSTH-MVRV which describes the magnitude of Unrealized Profit/Loss held, and a gauge on the financial incentive to sell.\nSTH-SOPR which describes the magnitude of Realized Profit/Loss locked in, providing a gauge on actualized sell-side pressure.\n\nStarting with STH-MVRV, we can assess extremes in this indicator relative to its 155-day average️, as well as an Upper Band (mean plus one standard deviation) 🟢 and a Lower Band (mean minus one standard deviation) 🔴.\n\nWe can see that several of the recent market highs and lows occurred alongside significant deviations outside these boundaries. This indicates that recent investors were in a statistically large degree of profit or loss at the time.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can see similar behaviour in the STH-SOPR indicator, which indicates that these investors were also taking action, opting to take profits near the highs and sell coins at a statistically meaningful loss near the lows.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nShifting Confidence\n\nNow that we have established a relationship between abrupt changes in implied (unrealized) profitability and the shift in spending by STHs (realized profitability), we will now introduce a method to assess the trend direction of this relationship.\n\nThe aim is to gauge the tides of shifting sentiment for new investors, constructed by looking at the deviation between the cost basis of two subgroups; holders and spenders.\n\n🟥 Negative Sentiment is when the cost basis of spenders is lower than holders.\n🟩 Positive Sentiment is when the cost basis of the spenders is higher than holders.\n\nFrom this perspective, we can see that the cost basis of STHs who are spending fell below the cost basis of holders as the market sold off from $29k to $26k in mid-August. This suggests a degree of panic and negative sentiment has taken hold in the near term.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nTo better visualize this indicator, we have normalized this metric by the spot price.\n\nRemarkably, the macro range for this indicator is largely bounded between extremes of -0.25 to 0.25, with occasional out of range spikes at market extreme pivot point. Here we will also disregard the neutral transitional range of -0.05 to 0.05 🟧 (which is arbitrary)\n\nThe first key insight is that intervals of negative sentiment during the recovery from the bear market typically last between 1.5 to 3.5 months. As noted, the market recently entered the first negative sentiment interval since the end of 2022.\n\nAnalysts can consider this tool when monitoring for positive shifts in STH sentiment. Should the trend start rising back towards the transitional and then positive territory (> -0.05), it would suggest that capital is starting to flow back into the market, and holders are back in a more favourable position.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe Bitcoin market is experiencing a non-trivial shift in sentiment, with almost all Short-Term Holders now underwater on their supply. This has resulted in a negative shift in sentiment, with investors spending now having a lower cost basis than the rest of the cohort. This suggests a degree of panic is dominating this group, which is the first time since FTX collapsed.\n\nSeveral metrics suggest that 2023 has seen a positive, but low momentum influx of new capital and new investors. This speaks to the persistent uncertainty coming from the macro-economic conditions, regulatory pressures, and tightness of liquidity across all markets.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Whilst HODLing remains the market preference, a significant proportion of the supply is teetering on the edge of falling into a significant unrealized loss.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nSep 11, 2023 • 9 min read\nExecutive Summary\nLiquidity, volatility, and volumes continue to compress across the digital asset market, with many metrics falling back to 2020 pre-bull levels.\nStablecoins are experiencing a persistent decline in supply as redemptions are made across all major stablecoin assets with the exception of Tether (USDT).\nThe Long-Term Holder cohort are steadfast in their holdings, spending remarkably little of it.\nShort-Term holders on the other hand are teetering on the edge of profitability, with a large majority of their supply acquired above the current price range.\n\nThe digital asset market has returned to a remarkably narrow trading range, experiencing a regime of compressed volatility, and exceptionally light volumes. All in all, it can be argued that extreme apathy and boredom best describe the prevailing sentiment. In recent weeks, we have explored how this is being expressed in both derivatives markets (WoC 32) and on-chain data (WoC 33). In last week's video report, we detailed some of the driving factors, primarily related to a regime of net capital outflows.\n\nIn this edition, we will further explore this drying up of liquidity, and how we can use on-chain data to better characterize this market structure.\n\n📊\nView all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\nStable Supply Declines\n\nWe will begin our study with a macro view of capital flows into the industry. Here, we consider the aggregate invested capital held within the three major assets, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins.\n\n🟢 Stablecoins have experienced a persistent decline in supply since April 2022, as redemption commenced following the collapse of LUNA-UST.\nBoth 🟠 BTC and 🔵 ETH experienced a net inflow of capital since the start of the year, seeing their Realized Cap's climb by up to $6.8B/mth (BTC) and $4.8B/mth, respectively.\nSince late August however, all three assets have seen a return to neutral or negtative inflows, suggesting a degree of stagnation and uncertainty has taken over.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nIf we isolate stablecoins, we can see that a total of $43B in capital has been redeemed, representing a total decline of 26% since the high set in March 2022. This can be argued to be a result of both capital leaving due to bear market conditions, but also a reflection of the opportunity cost of higher interest rates, which are not passed onto non-yielding stablecoins.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nBreaking down the three largest stablecoins, we can that these dynamics are not evenly distributed:\n\n🟢 USDT supplies have actually expanded by +$13.3B since the current cycle lows set in Nov 2022.\n🔵 USDC has seen an almost equal and opposite decline of -$16.7B, likely in part a reflection of US based institutions moving capital towards higher interest rate markets.\n🟡 BUSD has seen a dramatic decline of $20.4B (-89%), largely due to issuer Paxos moving into a redemption only mode following SEC enforcement.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nIf we look at it through the lends of relative dominance, we can see just how significant the expansion of Tether's market share is. USDT now represents 69% of the stablecoin market, a stark reversal from the 44% low in dominance hit in June 2022.\n\nBUSD dominance has fallen to 2.1%, and USDC to just 21.7%, a significant fall from the peak of 38% reached a little over a year ago.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nOn a shorter term horizon, we can look at the relative buy-side vs sell-side for the three major assets flowing into exchanges. Here we make a set of simple assumptions:\n\nWe assume the USD value of BTC and ETH flowing into exchanges is a proxy for 'sell-side' pressure.\nWe assume the USD value of stablecoins flowing into exchanges is a proxy for 'buy-side' pressure.\n\nThe chart below calculates the net USD difference between Stablecoin inflows (+ve) and BTC + ETH inflows. What we are looking for is less the absolute magnitude (as there will be error bars around these assumptions), but more-so any significant regime shifts.\n\n🟢 Positive values suggest a net buy-side regime, where buy-side of stablecoins exceed BTC+ETH sell-side.\n🔴 Negative values suggest a net sell-side regime, where buy-side of stablecoins are less than BTC+ETH sell-side.\n\nThe 2021 bull cycle was clearly dominated by net sell-side pressure as investors took profits during the mania of the uptrends. The collapse of LUNA-UST and 3AC in mid 2022 signified a shift back towards net accumulation, as investors worked to establish a market floor.\n\nSince April this year however, the market has returned to a relatively neutral level, aligned with the slow-down in BTC and ETH capital inflows, and the market becoming increasingly apathetic and uncertain.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nIt is Quiet On-chain...\n\nDespite the volatility spike experienced during the recent sell-off to $26k, and then again during following Grayscale's successful challenge of the SEC in the courts, Realized Volatility has remained remarkably low. The market is still in a historically low volatility environment, which is usually a precursor to heightened volatility down the road.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThis low liquidity and low volatility environment is also reflected across Bitcoin network settlement volumes. The total USD volume of coins changing hands (using our entity-adjustment clustering) is languishing around cycle lows of $2.44B/day, and has returned to October 2020 levels.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nIf we look at the realized value settled on-chain (being the delta between coin acquisition and disposal prices) we see that this remains extremely quiet. There is minimal profit or loss being locked in by the market overall, suggesting a majority of the coins which are transacting are within close proximity to their original acquisition price.\n\nRealized Profit and Loss are similarly at levels equivalent to the 2020 market, highlighting what is arguably a complete and total wash-out of the exuberance from the 2021 bull market.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can also track this on-chain illiquidity and apathetic sentiment by observing the proportion of wealth held in the most active and liquid subsection of the market, the ‘Hot Supply’ cohort (coins moved within the last week).\n\nThe realized value held in this 'Hot Supply' cohort old resides at historical lows, suggesting that very few coins which are older than 1-week are transacting at present.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nIt Is Quiet Off-chain Too...\n\nMoving across to off-chain derivatives markets, we can see that futures trading volumes have succumbed to a similar fate, hitting historical lows of $12B/day. The only period with lighter trade volume was the lull at the end of 2022, where the Bitcoin price traded within a $557 range for over two weeks (WoC 2).\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe have noticed an interesting divergence in Options markets however, where trade volumes have increased meaningfully in 2023, currently at $437M/day. This could be a reflection of the market preferring to use the leverage and capital efficiency of options to express their view during a period of tighter overall liquidity conditions.\n\nIt is important to note that whilst options markets now have a comparable magnitude of open interest relative to futures markets, options trade volumes remain an order of magnitude smaller.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAgain, despite a few days of sharp volatility over the last month, options markets continue to price in relatively low implied volatility. The initial uptick in volatility premium was short-lived, with 1-month implied volatility trading back at historical lows of 33.9% once again.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nThe Market HODLs On\n\nWith both the on- and off-chain domains being exceptionally quiet, it is of no surprise that the supply held by the Long-Term Holder cohort has reached a new ATH of 14.74M BTC. Conversely, the supply held within the Short-Term cohort, representing the more active portion of the market, has fallen to the lowest supply held since 2011.\n\nHODLing certainly remains the primary market dynamic, which both signals a steady conviction amongst existing holders, but highlights that these investors are likely the only ones who remain.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can find confluence within the Liveliness metric, which elegantly compares the balance of all time Coinday Destruction to Coinday Creation. In other words, Liveliness represents the relative balance of 'investor holding time' across the market.\n\nAligned with the net sell-side regime we covered above, 2021 saw a significant uptick in Liveliness, as older coins were spent and took profits. As the 2022 bear market set in between May and Dec 2021, a strong downtrend was established. This marked an inflection point from a traders market, towards a HODLer market.\n\nLiveliness has now reset to late 2020 conditions, and is seeing a progressively steeper downtrend. This indicates that aggregate 'investor holding time' is increasing, and investors are increasingly unwilling to spend and part with their held coins.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n📊\nLiveliness is a powerful metric which forms the bedrock of our recent Cointime Economics (download the PDF report here) framework, developed alongside Ark-Invest.\n\nA key insight from this work was the development of the True Market Mean price, which we argue is the most accurate 'cost basis' model for active Bitcoin investors. This model is currently located at $29.6k, and has formed a psychological resistance level since April of this year. The traditional Realized Price is trading at $20.3k, with both models bounding much of the years price action.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nMarket Sensitivity\n\nIf we apply these two pricing models as psychological boundaries to the URPD chart, we can better characterize the supply acquired between these two models. At present, over 4.81M BTC have a cost basis between $20.3k and $29.6k.\n\nWe can also see that with prices trading just under $26k at the time of writing, Short-Term Holders 🔴 are almost entirely underwater on their position. It could be argued that this puts this more price sensitive cohort a little bit on edge.\n\nLive in Engine Room\n\nThe chart below shows the percent of Short-Term Holder supply in Profit. We can see that the vast majority of their supply has been plunged into an unrealized loss, with only 16.3% of their supply still held 'in profit'.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nFor the Long-Term Holder cohort, their profitability is gradually increasing, although is still historically low, and has only left the minus one standard deviation band a few months ago. Whilst this is a constructive trend, over 26.7% of LTH supply is underwater relative to their acquisition price, and well below the all-time-mean.\n\nWhilst 2023 has been a fairly reasonable recovery for Bitcoin and digital assets, these findings would suggest there are still several psychological cost basis barriers that must still be overcome.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nVolatility, liquidity, trade volumes and on-chain settlement volumes are at historical lows. This reinforces the probability that the market has entered a period of extreme apathy, exhaustion, and arguably boredom.\n\nThe Long-Term HODLer cohort remain steadfast, relinquishing very little of their held supply. The Short-Term Holder cohort on the other hand are teetering on the edge of profitability, with many coins holding a cost basis above the current $26k trading range. This suggests that this cohort are increasingly price sensitive, and that many psychological price levels are yet to be overcome.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Derivatives markets are suggesting liquidity continues to move higher up the risk curve. We also deep dive into how liquidity pools provide market information.\n\nGlassnode, Alice Kohn\nSep 4, 2023 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nEvent driven volatility has re-entered digital assets markets in recent weeks, with notable indicators of aggregate capital outflows flagged leading into it.\nDerivative markets show a continual outflow of liquidity, particularly across ETH futures suggesting capital continues to move higher up the risk curve to relative safety.\nWe deep dive into how Uniswap liquidity pools have many similarities to options markets, with Liquidity Providers expressing a view on both volatility, and price levels.\nDigital Asset Markets Wake Up\n\nOver recent weeks, digital asset markets have been shaken awake from a period of historically light volatility. This was driven primarily by two key events:\n\nThe flash crash on 17-Aug where BTC and ETH sold off -11% and -13%, respectively.\nNews over Greyscale's legal victory over the SEC broke 29-Aug, driving prices briefly higher, however all gained ground was lost over the following three days.\n\nSpot prices for both BTC and ETH are currently languishing around the August lows.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA key metric for tracking aggregate capital flows into the industry is the Aggregate Realized Value metric. This tool combines:\n\nThe realized cap of the two majors BTC and ETH\nThe supply of leading five stablecoins USDT, USDC, BUSD, DAI and TUSD.\n\nFrom this, it becomes clear that the market had entered a regime of capital outflow in early August, well before these two major events. Approximately $55B in capital has left the digital asset space through August.\n\nThis trend is driven by capital outflows across all three assets Bitcoin, Etheruem and stablecoins.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nWithin the Ethereum ecosystem, there has been a mixed reaction across indices for the DeFi, GameFi, and Staking sectors. Each index is constructed from the average supply-weighted price of 'Blue-Chip' tokens in the sector.\n\nWe can see that DeFi and GameFi tokens have performed relatively poorly (-17%) and (-20%) compared to the majors, whilst Liquid Staking tokens were somewhat better off (-7.7%). Across the board however, the downside price action was similiar or less severe than the downturns seen in March, April and June.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nRisk Appetite Declines Across Derivatives Markets\n\nOne of the key developments over the 2021-23 cycle has been the maturation of derivatives markets, especially for BTC and ETH. The way derivatives markets price these assets can provide information about market sentiment and positioning.\n\nGeneral activity across Ethereum futures and options markets in 2023 is notably below levels seen throughout 2021 and 2022. The average daily trade volume across both markets has declined to just $14.3B/day, which is around half the average volume over the last two years. This week, volume is even lower at $8.3B/day, suggesting liquidity continues to drain from the space.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThis trend is mirrored in derivatives Open Interest. Following the market lows set in the wake of the FTX collapse, Open Interest started to climb in early 2023. For Options, open interest peaked during the March banking crisis when USDC experienced a depeg from $1. Ethereum futures open interest peaked around the Shanghai Upgrade, suggesting this was the last major speculative event for the asset.\n\nSince then the notional value of active contracts in both markets has been quite stable. Similar to our observation for BTC markets (WoC 32), ETH options markets are now of a similar scale ($5.3B) to future markets ($4.2B), and are in fact larger in size at present.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nSince the beginning of the year, there has been a notable uptick in Ethereum options markets, with volume rising by +256% to a daily trade of $326M/day. Meanwhile, futures volumes have experienced a steady decline this year, falling from $20B/day in early January, to just $8B.day today.  The only notable exception was a brief uptick to around $30B/day around the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nGiven there has been no significant shift in trade volumes for either market in August, it suggests that traders are continuing to move liquidity higher up the risk curve.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nLooking to the Pull/Call ratio, we can see a high degree of responsiveness to major news events. For example, after BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin ETF, sentiment became more bullish, driving the Pull/Call ratio lower from 0.72 to 0.40.\n\nHowever, this changed with the sell-off on 17-Aug, as the Pull/Call ratio increased to 0.50, and with call volumes dropping strongly from $320M/day to $140M/day.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nAre Liquidity Pools Options Markets?\n\nTo bolster our analysis above, we will now examine the activities across Automated Market Makers like the Uniswap ETH/USDC Pool. Since the introduction of concentrated liquidity on Uniswap V3, a thesis has circulated Uniswap Liquidity Positions can be considered in a similar light to pricing put and call options. While we do not believe that options concepts describe these dynamics completely, there are certainly many parallels worth exploring further.\n\nOur analysis will focus on the USDC/ETH 0.05% Pool, which is the most active Uniswap pool, and thus can be expected to provide the highest signal. This pool has a 7-day trade volume of $1.51B, and $260m in Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\nUniswap V3 has a unique feature of concentrated liquidity. Liquidity providers (LPs) can select a price range where their provided liquidity will be concentrated. Fees will only be earned when the market trades in this range (analogous to strike prices), and the tighter the range, the larger the relative fee revenue. This leads to both a better user experience for DEX traders, as spreads tend to be tighter, and improved capital efficiency for LPs.\n\nIn this way, it can be argued that the positioning of LPs capital must factor in an expectation of volatility (spread between upper and lower bound), and the expected price ranges (strike level above and below). The thesis is that assuming LPs are actively managing their position, we may be able to draw similar insights to those from options market data.\n\nSource: Uniswap Whitepaper\n\nWe begin by observing the general activity in the USDC/ETH 0.05% pool. For various reasons, we will avoid using the TVL metric as a gauge of activity in a pool or a respective token pair. Instead, we will express activity terms of two metrics:\n\nMints per Day representing the number of liquidity positions opened by LPs, and\nBurns per Day representing the number of liquidity positions closed by LPs.\n\nBy these measures, activity contracted after the March banking crisis, and the Shanghai Upgrade in April, and then remained relatively low until early June. We then see a spike in new Mints and Burns around BlackRock ETF announcement, and then again during the 17-Aug sell-off.\n\nThe chart below also shows the net change in LP position counts as a measure of the balance between positions opening and closing. We note that this metric is less affected by market trends but more so by discrete events suggesting short-term volatility is a key motivator.\n\nWhen examining the distribution of liquidity across different price ranges in the Uniswap pool, we can see that LPs are currently supplying a majority of liquidity above the current price tick.\n\nThe most concentrated liquidity (approx 30.4% of capital) is located within an 11% price range, with expected downside of -2.7% and upside of +8.6%. A second tier of liquidity is positioned with a -8.5% buffer to the downside, and a +23.7% buffer to the upside. It could be argued that Uniswap LPs are expressing an expectation of optimism and market upside for ETH in general.\n\nIf we compare this to option strike prices for contracts expiring at the end of September, we can see a similar positive outlook. 70% of calls have a strike price between $1.7k and $2.3k, while 75% of puts have a strike between $1.3k and $1.9k. These price levels largely align with the Uniswap Liquidity pool liquidity distribution.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nTurning back to the USDC/ETH Uniswap Pool, we can analyze how liquidity concentrations have adjusted over time. The heatmap below shows the density of liquidity, expressed in increasingly cool-to-hot colors.\n\nWith the expansion of automated LP strategies and execution, liquidity providers have become quite successful in arranging liquidity very close the spot price during periods of higher volatility. On 1-June, a large amount of liquidity was expanded just above the price at that time (shown in by a deeper yellow zone). This arguably indicated an expectation for higher fee revenue in this zone by market makers. This liquidity prevailed until the flash crash in August, where liquidity concentrations were adjusted to be increasingly below the $1.8k. This chart provides a remarkable view into how responsive LPs are relative to market events and volatility.\n\nIt is also interesting to note how high concentrations of liquidity, represented by red zones, coincides with strong price movements and often times trend reversals. By inspection, is does indicate that Uniswap liquidity pools could indeed be a valuable source of information for gauging market sentiment and positioning.\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nThe initial optimism surrounding Grayscale's victory over the SEC was short-lived, with Ethereum's value dipping back to the August lows within a matter of days. Spot markets continue seeing capital outflows, and derivative markets are also witnessing a persistent decline in liquidity. Overall, investors appear hesitant to return to the markets, preferring to move capital higher up the risk curve.\n\nWe performed a study on Uniswap liquidity pools, seeking to identify if similar pricing information to options markets could be obtained. Our analysis demonstrates that liquidity capital is quite responsive to market events, and that insights can likely be found with respect to the volatility and price expectations of LPs.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nEvaluating Exchange Risk\n\nWith hindsight and lessons learned from FTX, the monitoring of exchange related risks is a critical component of digital asset risk management. In this report, we develop three indicators which may help highlight periods of heightened counter party risk.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nAug 28, 2023 • 10 min read\nExecutive Summary\nExchanges remain the centrepiece of the digital asset industry, where the vast majority of trade takes place.\nOur assessment, based on entity-adjusted data, indicates that 54% of the economical on-chain volume for Bitcoin is related to either exchange deposits or withdrawals.\nDrawing insights from the lessons of the FTX collapse, we introduce three metrics to pinpoint unusual exchange activity: the Reshuffling Ratio, the Reliance Ratio, and the Whale Withdrawal Ratio.\"\nUsing this exchange risk framework, we assess Binance, Coinbase, Huobi and FTX to provide an overview of various exchange on-chain behaviors.\n📊\nView all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n🕰️ Introducing Cointime Economics\n\nWe are proud to release a groundbreaking new framework for Bitcoin On-chain Analysis, prepared in a joint venture between Glassnode and ARK-Invest. Material is available in several formats to introduce this new concept:\n\nPart 1 prepared by ARK-Invest is a high-level overview whitepaper.\nPart 2 prepared by Glassnode is a detailed exploration of the framework.\nA summary blog post is available on our Insights portal.\nA dashboard with all live charts is available on Glassnode Studio.\nOn-chain Footprints of Exchanges\n\nThe chaos of the FTX failure in Nov 2022 was a stark reminder of counter-party risk within the digital asset industry. Whilst hindsight is 20/20, exchanges remain the centrepiece of trade, and thus risk mitigation and management become critical.\n\nThe Glassnode suite currently offers on-chain data covering balances and fund flows associated with 20+ centralized exchanges. In this edition, we will present a few components of a framework for assessing exchange risk using on-chain data.\n\nThe supply held on centralized exchanges peaked at 3.203M BTC in March 2020, and has steadily declined since. Total exchange balances reached a five-year low this week of 2.256M BTC. Note that these exchange balances consider the direct exchange-related wallet clusters but do not include dedicated custodians or ETF style instruments (like GBTC, or Microstrategy etc.).\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nOne remarkable aspect of this chart is the dominance of the top three exchanges, which have continuously held around ~1.5M BTC since early 2019. The current supply held on these exchanges is estimated to be as follows:\n\nBinance 691.2k BTC\nCoinbase 439.8k BTC\nBitfinex 320.7k BTC\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThe chart below illustrates the relative supply distribution between centralized exchanges 🟡 and non-exchange entities 🟠. We also show Entity-Adjusted Transfer Volume as a form of ‘active’ layer on top 🟣, and excluding the 1.457 million BTC considered Lost Supply ⚫\n\nExchanges reserves comprise 2.31M BTC (11.8%) of the circulating supply, while 122k BTC (0.6%) worth of economic value is transferred on-chain each day.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nOf this 122k BTC volume, exchange deposits or withdrawals account for over 54% of it (67.3k BTC/day, usually 50/50 deposits/withdrawals). As such, observations of the economic flows in and out of exchanges tend to be quite information dense.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nExploring Exchange Flows\n\nWith an appreciation for the magnitude of exchange flows, we can dive deeper into the funds flowing between entities and exchanges. In the next chart, we have added Exchange inflow and outflow volumes together to form a single metric, Exchange Fund Flow 🟦 (with a 90-day average applied).\n\nHere we can see the dominance of Exchange Fund Flows 🔴 has reached 54% of economic volumes, and is in a macro uptrend. Exchange dominance reached 58% in June 2021, before falling sharply as global interest rates started accelerating higher, liquidity started tightening and the bear market set in soon after. Dominance started rising again in October 2022 as both global liquidity and the market recovered from the FTX fallout.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench \n\nWe can break down the dominance of on-chain volumes flows into four buckets:\n\n🟠 Non-exchange related on-chain volume (Entity-Adjusted).\n🔵 All Exchange related flows (inflows and outflows).\n🟣 Whale-to/from-exchanges: funds transferred to/from whales (1k BTC+) and exchanges.\n🔴 Inter-Exchange flows: funds transferred from one exchange cluster to another.\n\nInter-exchange flow have remained relatively stable at around 7.5% of total on-chain volume, setting a peak of 11.7% in  June 2021. Meanwhile, the whale-exchange share has recently reached a new all-time high of 17.9% (covered in WoC 30).\n\nAs we can see, the overall dominance of exchange related flows (54%) 🔵 are currently near the all-time-highs.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nAn Exchange Risk Framework\n\nThe first part of this report established a view over the macro dominance that exchanges play in the Bitcoin ecosystem. However in the wake of FTX, exchanges can also be a source of counter-party risk.\n\nIn the next section, we aim introduce a framework which may be used to analyze the associated risk for an individual exchange. Throughout this section, we consider the FTX data-set as a reference point for high-risk instances in the future. Reflecting the dominance of Coinbase, and the recent market commentary around Binance and Huobi, we will present data associated with these exchanges for comparison purposes only.\n\nWe will present this framework using three indicator constructions:\n\nThe Internal Reshuffling Ratio - the proportion of the exchange balance which is transacted internally over a period of time.\nExchange Reliance Ratio - the degree to which an exchanges balance moves to/from other exchanges (inter-exchange transfers).\nWhale Withdrawal Ratio - indicators that large entities are withdrawing at elevated rates.\nThe Internal Reshuffling Ratio\n\nThe first indicator considers the ratio of volume transacted within the exchange cluster, and the total balance reserve for the asset of interest. To deliver a comparable indicator across all exchanges and assets, the output values are capped by a range of 0 to 1.\n\nThe core idea is to identify situations where more than 100% of the exchange balance has transacted within the exchange cluster over a 7-day period. If this structure persists over a long time, and/or across multiple asset types, it may be warning sign of mismanagement of funds.\n\nFor FTX, we can see that their BTC balance sustained values of 1.0 from March 2021 until failure in Nov 2022. We also show an ‘Aggregated Risk’ score considering four of the largest assets BTC, ETH, USDC and USDT.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nIf we compare this to the other three exchanges, we can see there are some exchange specific nuances:\n\nBinance (top left): During periods of major volatility, the reshuffling ratio experiences abrupt peaks across all assets which quickly cool off. Since these are seemingly a market response and are not sustained, it is likely a result of working through new deposits and withdrawals.\nCoinbase (top right): Very few reshuffling events are noted except for USDC which is sustained at 1.0 for long periods. This is highly likely associated with Coinbase’s partnership with issuer Circle, and acting as a primary venue for USDC on/off boarding.\nFTX (btm left): The reshuffling ratio of BTC signalled a high-risk status for 14 months prior to the exchange’s collapse. This in hindsight, was likely a result of Alameda misappropriating customer funds.\nHuobi (btm right): A similar volatility linked activity to Binance is seen for this exchange.\nLive Professional Workbenches (Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Huobi)\n\nThe chart below compares the Aggregated Reshuffling Ratios for the four exchanges across the four assets. Here we use a threshold value of 5% (of aggregate balance reshuffled) to flag potentially high-risk events. From this perspective, Binance and Coinbase see very little internal ‘churn’ of their balances.\n\nFTX stands out for all the wrong reasons, as we now know.\n\nLive Professional Workbenches (Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Huobi)\n\nHuobi can be ranked somewhere in between these cases, with a volatility-linked Reshuffling Ratio similar to Binance, however, amplified given the progressively declining asset balance on the exchange (a decreasing denominator).\n\nLive Standard Chart\nExchange Reliance Ratio\n\nAnother potential indicator of exchange risk may be when a significant portion of an exchange’s balance is regularly transferred to/from another exchange. This may suggest an elevated degree of reliance or co-dependence of liquidity between these exchanges.\n\nSimilar to the prior section, we have calculated this ratio for the top four assets in the market and capped output values to a range of -1 to 1. We can also see the direction of funds by whether the ratio is positive (net inflows) or negative (net outflows), as well as investigate the source and destination.\n\nLarge negative values in this indicator suggest that assets are rapidly flowing out of the subject exchange and moving towards another exchange counter-party, raising an alert if it lasts for a sustained period of time.\n\nReviewing the top four assets across the aforementioned exchanges:\n\nBinance (top left): All assets have a neutral and close-to-zero reliance ratio, suggesting fund flowing from or to other exchanges are small by comparison to the balance on Binance. The USDC reliance ratio has been indicating a high deposit rate regime since September 2022, potentially explained by looking at the USDC on Coinbase.\nCoinbase (top right): Similar to Binance, all assets show a neutral reliance ratio. However, the USDC indicator shows a high withdrawal rate since September 2022. This suggests that a significant relocation of USDC supply has been occurring from Coinbase to Binance over the last 12 months.\nFTX (btm left): The Reliance ratios for all four assets were significantly negative well before the exchange failed. This suggests that investors (and Alameda) were withdrawing all major assets towards other exchange accounts.\nHuobi (btm right): Assessing this risk indicator for Huobi, we can see a relatively large negative Reliance Ratio across all assets, suggesting net transfers from Huobi to other exchanges.\n\nLive Professional Workbenches (Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Huobi)\n\nWe again show an aggregated the Reliance Ratio which shows Binance and Coinbase have a very small reliance of -5% or higher, indicating that their behavior is largely independent of other exchanges.\n\nOn the other hand, FTX and Huobi have a highly negative aggregated Reliance Ratios, indicating a sustained regime of entities active on other exchanges withdrawing funds from these entities.\n\nLive Professional Workbenches (Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Huobi)\nBitcoin Whale Withdrawal Ratio\n\nThe final indicator is a tool to monitor whether bitcoin whales are increasing their withdrawal rate. This parameter is calculated as the ratio between total weekly whale outflows and the bitcoin balance on the exchange. In other words, we are looking for the percentage of supply removed by whales over the last seven days.\n\nAlongside the Whale Withdrawal Ratio 🟧, we also present the all-time average of this indicator 🔴 as a benchmark over the long-term.\n\nBoth Coinbase and Binance show a very low Whale Withdrawal Ratio over last two years, with a long-term average value remaining below 5%.\nFor FTX, the jump in the Whale Withdrawal Ratio started when LUNA and 3AC collapsed, and sustained high levels right through to the ultimate failure of the exchange itself.\nFor Huobi, we can see a relatively low-risk pattern up until June 2023. It is over recent months that whale entities have seen a sustained uptick in withdrawal activity relative to the Huobi BTC balance. We note again that this will in part be driven by the sustained drawdown in Huobi BTC balances, which itself is an indicator for heightened awareness.\nLive Professional Workbenches (Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Huobi)\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe failure of FTX was a painful reminder for the digital asset industry that counterparty risk remains with centralized exchanges and custodians. With hindsight as our guide, we developed three metrics which provide a limited view on some potential risk vectors within exchange entities, leveraging our on-chain data and labelling clusters.\n\nWhat we find is that through the lens of the Reshuffling Ratio, Reliance Ratio, and Whale Withdrawal Ratio, Coinbase and Binance share a relatively similar and unalarming overall on-chain footprint. FTX, unfortunately stands out as a prime example of risk indicators to watch out for. For Huobi, the persistent decline in their exchange balance across the four major assets BTC, ETH, USDT and USDC will have an amplifying effect on these metrics, however it does suggest that a degree of caution may be warranted.\n\nNote: This report is limited in scope and only considers a small subset of indicators using lessons learned from the FTX event. We considered only the major four assets and four exchanges for brevity, however the concepts can be reformulated and iterated upon for others.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nBitcoin Flash Crash\n\nThe Bitcoin bulls have been caught off guard this week, as the largest single day sell-off of the year sends BTC prices below $25k. A deleveraging in futures markets appears to be the catalyst, however a bigger concern may be the 88.3% of Short-Term Holder supply now held in an unrealized loss.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nAug 21, 2023 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe market experienced a violent sell-off last week, sending BTC prices below $25k, and ending a period of historically low volatility.\nThe market has been slicing through several important price support models, putting the bulls on the back-foot.\nA primary driver appears to be a leverage flush-out in derivatives market, seeing over $2.5B worth of open interest cleared in just a few hours.\nOptions markets have sharply repriced volatility premiums from historical lows, although open interest remains remarkably stable.\nSpot markets are still relatively 'top heavy', with over 88.3% of Short-Term Holder supply now held at an unrealized loss.\nWe introduce a responsive experimental indicator which helps identify inflection points in market profitability and trend.\n📊\nThe Week On-chain Dashboard contains all charts covered in this edition.\nTechnical Damage\n\nThe digital asset market experienced a violent sell-off last week, marking a dramatic end to the exhausting lack of volatility that dominated since July. As we covered in the last two editions (WoC 32, WoC 33), price action for BTC had reached some of the lowest volatility levels on record, and options markets in particular had heavily discounted the possibility of significant downside volatility.\n\nAfter several weeks trading just above $29.3k, BTC prices exploded lower, slicing through several long term moving averages, including the 111-day, 200-day, and the 200-week. With the market closing the week at around $26.1k, this represents a significant loss of market support, and the bulls now have their work cut out for them.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe sell-off also pushed prices below the Short-Term Holder cost basis, an on-chain price model which has historically provided support during robust up-trends. With the Realized Price and Long-Term Holder cost basis trading some distance below ($20.3k), this puts the market in a somewhat precarious position from a psychological standpoint.\n\nAs we noted last week (WoC 33), the supply held by the Short-Term Holder cohort is somewhat 'top heavy', with a significant majority having a cost basis above $29.0k. This is a topic we will revisit later in this edition.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe weekly price action traded down -11.3%, which is a significant fall, but is not the most significant in recent years. This performance is slightly shy of the long-term one standard deviation move of -12.6%, a level which was breached during major capitulation events such as the collapse events of FTX, 3AC, and LUNA.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOn a daily basis however, this is the largest single day sell-off year to date, falling -7.2% on the 17-August. This did exceed a one standard deviation move to the downside, catching the bulls off guard.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboards: Price performance metrics are available in specific dashboards for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nLive Chart\nOptions Reprice Volatility\n\nImplied volatility in options markets had reached all-time lows by the start of the week, trading 50% below the long-term baseline seen throughout 2021-22. Of course, as this week's sell-off kicked off, volatility was quickly repriced. Implied volatility more than doubled for short dated contracts with an expiry out to the end of September.\n\nLive Chart\n\nPut options naturally experienced the sharpest repricing, with 25-Delta Skew reversing completely, rallying from historical lows of -10% to over +10%. Overall, options traders were shaken violently awake from their sleep, being forced to reevaluate volatility expectations moving forwards.\n\nLive Chart\n\nInterestingly, open interest for both call and put options remained surprisingly stable, with very little net change given the explosive price action. This suggests that whilst volatility was likely mispriced, there wasn't a great deal of forced deleveraging in options markets.\n\nOne development we highlighted in WoC 32 is that the magnitude of open interest in Bitcoin options markets is now comparable to futures markets, meaning analysts should keep a close eye on both.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboards: Options market data is available in dashboards prepared for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. \nLive Chart\n\nOptions trade volume did spike higher, increasing by 200%+ to $620M/day for calls, and $326M/day for puts. It remains to be seen if this elevated volatility regime sticks around, or whether the prevailing low liquidity environment reverts back to a low enthusiasm market.\n\nLive Chart\nFutures Flush-out\n\nUnlike options markets, futures traders did experience a major deleveraging event which has remarkable similarities to the FTX collapse. Whilst smaller in scale, over $2.5 Billion worth of perpetual futures contracts were closed out in a single day. This represents a -24.5% decline, and a complete unwind of all leverage build up through July-August.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA total of $230M in long positions were liquidated and forced closed in a few hours, making for the largest liquidation event since LUNA collapsed in May 2022. This liquidation event was larger in magnitude than the short squeeze which kicked off the 2023 rally in Jan, suggesting it may have trend changing potential.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFutures markets also experienced a negative dislocation due to the forced selling, driving futures prices well below the spot market index. Funding rates went negative to create an incentive for market makers to open long positions and arbitrage price differentials.\n\nThis is the deepest negative funding rate since the March sell-off to $19.8k, although the dislocation last week is smaller in magnitude. In general, this suggests that the leverage build-up and subsequent deleveraging in futures markets was a primary factor driving this sell-off.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: Perpetual futures markets are the most heavily traded venues in the industry, with data available comparing Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nLive Chart\nTop Heavy Spot Markets\n\nA concept we revised last week (WoC 33) was the notion of a 'top heavy market', where significant volumes of spot supply has a cost basis near or above the current price. When the BTC price moves suddenly, we can see the magnitude of supply that falls into loss via changes in the Percent Supply in Profit metric.\n\nHere we see that 12.8% (2.48M BTC) of the supply fell into an unrealized loss this week, setting a lower low on this metric. This suggests that 'top heaviness' in spot markets may also be a factor in play.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we look to the response by Long-Term Holders (LTHs), we can see that there is almost no response. The LTH cohort did not meaningfully increase volume sent to exchanges, and their aggregate balance actually ticked up to a new ATH this week.\n\nThus, we can conclude Short-Term Holders (STHs) are more relevant to assess.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: We have compiled a dashboard with several metrics that describe LTHs, STHs, Whales, and miner volumes interacting with exchanges.\nLive Chart\n\nWith LTH supply at ATH, we can also see that STH supply remains at multi-year lows. However, the chart below overlays the proportion of STH supply which is held at an unrealized loss.\n\nNote how sharp upticks in STH Supply in Loss tend to follow 'top heavy markets' such as May 2021, Dec 2021, and again this week. Out of the 2.56M BTC held by STHs, only 300k BTC (11.7%) is still in profit.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe next chart shows the Profit or Loss Bias (dominance) of STH volumes flowing into exchanges. We can see a steady decline in profit dominance as the 2023 rally progressed, as more STHs acquired coins with an increasingly elevated cost basis.\n\nThis week we saw the largest loss dominance reading since the March sell-off to $19.8k. This suggests that the STH cohort are both largely underwater on their holdings, and increasingly price sensitive.\n\nLive Chart\nMetric Deep Dive: Realized Loss Momentum\n\nFinally, we will close out with one of the more advanced and responsive tools under development by the Glassnode team. The goal of this tool is to identify significant market inflection points, such as 'top or bottom heavy markets'. It is designed as follows:\n\nDuring macro up-trends, investors generally become increasingly profitable, with losses becoming less frequent (and vice versa in downtrends).\nThis results the ratio between Realized Profit/Loss (P/L) remaining above 1.0 for sustained periods of time during market up-trends. Conversely, the Loss/Profit (L/P) Ratio remains above 1.0 during downtrends.\nIf we compare the P/L Ratio to its 1yr moving average, we can establish a P/L Momentum indicator 🟢 which will spike higher when profit dominance increases rapidly. This often occurs following a loss dominant regime (such as near bottom-heavy inflection points). A similar L/P Momentum 🔴 can be calculated for identifying top-heavy inflection points.\nA dominance oscillator (at the bottom of the chart) can also be constructed to provide another perspective for identifying inflection points.\n\nThe variant of this metric shown below is specifically for Short-Term Holders who are the most reactive cohort to market volatility. We can see that after several months of declining profit dominance, Loss momentum and dominance have increased meaningfully. False signals do occur such as during the March 2023 correction, and these have historically recovered quickly.\n\nHowever, sustained declines have also preceded more violent downtrends such as in May and Dec 2021, making this weeks sell-off one to keep a close eye on.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: Four variants of this Realized Profit/Loss Momentum indicator are available for our Professional and Institutional members in this dashboard. Please note that these are experimental and are still under active development and research (with feedback most welcome).\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe Bitcoin market was shaken violently awake this week, selling off -7.2% on 17-Aug, making for the largest single day down move YTD. Many indicators point to a future market deleveraging as the most probable driver, with options traders also forced to rethink and reprice volatility premiums.\n\nLong-Term Holders remain largely unfazed and unresponsive, which is a typical behavior pattern of this cohort during bear market hangover periods. Short-Term Holders however are of greater interest, with 88.3% of their held supply (2.26M BTC) now held at an unrealized loss. This is compounded by an acceleration in STH realized losses being sent to exchanges, as well as the loss of key technical moving average support, putting the bulls on the back-foot.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nExhaustion and Apathy\n\nThe Bitcoin market has reached a stage of extreme apathy and exhaustion, with volatility measures and several key on-chain indicators reaching all-time-low readings. With the market being somewhat top-heavy, we assess how investors are responding to the boredom.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nAug 14, 2023 • 10 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe digital asset market continues trading within a historically low volatility regime, with several metrics indicating extreme apathy and exhaustion has been reached in the $29k to $30k range.\nThere are some indicators that the market is slightly ‘top-heavy’ as indicated by the concentration of Short-Term Holder supply and cost basis around the current spot price.\nWe explore several new iterations of SOPR by age band as a tool to monitor profit taking behavior by various cross sections of the market.\n📊\nThe Week On-chain Dashboard contains all charts covered in this edition.\nModest Capital Inflows\n\nThe Realized Cap is one of the most important metrics in the on-chain analysis toolbox, representing the cumulative capital inflow since inception. Both the magnitude and gradient of the Realized Cap are informative, suggesting over $16B in value (+4.1%) has flowed into Bitcoin YTD.\n\nHowever, we can also see the climb is quite shallow, a far cry from the steep rise seen during the 2021-22 uptrend. This indicates that whilst capital is flowing in, it is doing so at a very modest pace.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can decompose the Realized Cap into the Long-Term and Short-Term Holder components. The wealth held by the STH cohort has experienced an increase of +$22B this year, whilst the LTH cohort has seen an approximately equal reduction of -$21B.\n\nThis reflects two mechanics:\n\nShort-Term Holders chasing the market higher, creating an elevated average cost basis.\nSupply acquired at prices below $24k in Q1 maturing into LTH status, resulting in a declining average cost basis.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can see this within the cost basis estimates for each cohort. The STH cost basis is up +59% YTD, currently trading at $28.6k. The LTH cost basis is trading much lower at around $20.3k.\n\nThe separation between these two cost basis is an indicator that many recent buyers have a relatively elevated acquisition price.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can confirm this using the URPD distribution split into these two cohorts. Note how a large cluster of STH coins 🔴 are located between $25k and $31k. On a macro scale, this supply distribution does resembles similar periods during bear market recoveries in the past. However, on a shorter timeframe, it could be argued to be a slightly top heavy market, with many price sensitive investors at risk of falling into an unrealized loss.\n\nLive in the Glassnode Engine Room\n\nWe note that the the supply held by Long-Term Holders continues to increase, hitting an ATH of 14.6M BTC. In direct contrast, Short-Term Holder supply has declined to multi-year low of 2.56M BTC.\n\nOverall, this suggests that conviction of Bitcoin investors does remain impressively high, and very few are willing to liquidate their holdings.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nApathy, Exhaustion and a Lack of Volatility\n\nAs we covered in last weeks edition (WoC 32), price volatility for BTC has collapsed to historical lows. The upper and lower Bollinger Bands are currently separated by just 2.9%, with a tighter spread only seen on two occassions in history:\n\nSept 2016 - Price was $604 and was early in the 2016-17 run-up.\nJan 2023 - Price was $16.8k and traded within a $52 range to start the year (WoC 2).\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nAnother lens to observe this volatility compression (investor exhaustion) is via the spending behavior of investors. Here we use Realized Value as a measure under the following framework:\n\nHigh volatility motivates investors to spend coins that were acquired at a cost basis much higher (in loss) or lower (in profit) than the spot exchange rate.\nLow volatility (and investor exhaustion) results in most coins moved on-chain having a cost basis very close to the spot rate (and thus realized very small profit/loss).\n\nAn ideal tool to monitor this is the Sell-Side Risk Ratio, which compares the absolute value of realized profit  loss (the change in asset valuation) to the realized cap (asset valuation). For STHs, we can see this metric is effectively at all-time lows, with fewer than 27 trading days (0.57%) recording a lower value.\n\nThis indicates that all investors who sought to take profit or loss at this price range have now done so, and the market must make a move to motivate new spending (i.e. an indicator for impending volatility).\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nThe Short-Term Holder Profit / Loss ratio shows that profit taking remains dominant for this cohort, however it has cooled off back towards neutral in recent weeks. If sufficient new demand flows in, this ratio should remain above 1. However if losses start to accellerate (P/L Ratio falls below 1), it may indicate that stress within the ‘top heavy market’ is starting to play out.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: The on-chain behaviour of Short-Term Holders can be further explored in this dashboard, providing a view into the sentiment and positioning of this cohort.\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nIf we turn to the LTH cohort, we can also see they’re also within a profit driven regime, having only just recovered from the severe losses throughout the 2022 bear market. The LTH Profit/Loss Ratio remains small in magnitude, and a far cry from prior bull market conditions.\n\nOnly 472 / 4963 (9.5%) of all profitable trading days have recorded a lower value, highlighting the infancy of this uptrend.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nThe Long-Term Sell-Side Risk Ratio is also pushing towards all-time-lows, with only 44 trading days (1.1%) recording a lower value. Overall, this suggests that volatility and price expansion (in either direction) is likely required to break this spell of investor apathy and exhaustion.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: The on-chain behaviour of Long-Term Holders can be further explored in this dashboard, providing a view into the sentiment and positioning of this cohort.\nLive Professional Workbench\nThe Temperature of Supply\n\nAnalysis of the Bitcoin supply and demand balance often utilises the dimension of ‘investor holding time’, accounting for the time since a coin last moved on-chain. Often we can relate these age bands to investor conviction as is the case with the Long/Short-Term heuristic at 155-days (research here).\n\nWe can also consider the supply under a slightly different framework to identify market shifts:\n\n🔴 Hot Supply (< 1w) is the most active and liquid portion which has transacted within the last 7-days.\n🟠 Warm Supply (1w-6m) comprises the less active component of Short-Term Holder supply, right through to the start of the Long-Term Holder cohort.\n🔵 Single-Cycle Long-Term Holders (6m-3y) being the supply which transacted within the last three years, and is therefore reasonably likely to respond to macro market trends (see our report detailing this cohort here).\nHot Supply (< 1-week)\n\nStarting with the most active and liquid of coins, we can see that Hot Supply currently accounts for just 2.8% of all invested value held in BTC. This is in line with the extremely ‘illiquid’ hangover periods seen after all late stage bear markets. It describes a market where only the HODLer cohort remain, and trade volumes tend to be extremely low.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe recently rolled out Workbench support for the Realized Cap HODL Waves (and similar multi-line style charts). We can use this tool to calculate the cost basis for hot supply and compare it to that of the parent Short-Term Holder cohort. From this we can identify two interesting pieces of market structure:\n\nThe STH cost basis tends to provide support in uptrends as investors acquire near their break-even point during corrections.\nLarge deviations between the Hot Supply cost basis and the STH cost basis often align with local market peaks.\n\nThis latter point is a result of speculators chasing the price into local peaks, driving up the Hot Supply cost basis, but increasing the volume of supply at risk of a drawdown. This can create a near-term pause in the rally until sufficient demand returns during the correction.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nIf we look to the SOPR family for Hot Supply, we can see this playing out in their profit taking behavior:\n\n🔴 < 24h coins tend to be spent close to their break-even price.\n🔵 1d-1w coins take profits (SOPR > 1) during rallies and local market highs.\n🟢 1w-1m coins see a similar profitable peak, although at a larger amplitude due to the longer holding time (and thus larger price delta since acquisition).\n\nThis early work on SOPR variants by age bands provides an interesting insight into the supply and demand structure playing out day-to-day.\n\nWarm Supply\n\nMoving onto the Warm Supply group (1w-6m), we can see a slight uptick YTD, accounting for around 30% of the wealth stored in Bitcoin.\n\nWhilst this value is meaningful in magnitude, it is extremely low in a comparitive context. By proxy, the extremely small proportion of wealth held within both Hot and Warm supply indicates that the most significant holdings are within the more mature Long-Term Holder supply.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nGiven Warm Supply accounts for the majority of the age range (and coin volume) within the Short-Term Holder cohort, the average cost basis is very similar to STHs. If we look at it through the lens of the Warm Supply MVRV ratio, we can see it is approaching a retest of its break-even level at $27.6K.\n\nThis further supports the Sell-side Risk Ratio observations from the prior section, where volatility is likely brewing.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nExtended breaks above, or below the Warm Supply cost basis have historically aligned with a macro shift in the market trend, with the average uptrend lasting 227 days, and an average downtrend lasting 132 days.\n\nThe 2023 rally has now traded above this model for 212-days so far, hovering slightly above it today.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe 2023 market strength was successfully capitalized upon, with profit taking visible across all SOPR constituents within the Warm Supply cohort. The average spent coin is locking in between 4% and 9% profit over the last few months.\n\nSingle Cycle Long-Term Holders\n\nThe final cohort are the Single Cycle Long-Term Holders. This cohort covers investors that weathered the full spectrum of excitement, chaos, and volatility of the 2020-23 cycle.\n\nHODLing remains the preferred market dynamic for this group, accounting for over 63% of the invested capital. This has reached similar heights as past transitional phases between late stage bear markets, and new macro uptrends.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe cost basis of these single cycle holders is currently at $33.8k, suggesting that this group is still holding an average unrealized loss of -13.3%. This compares to the average LTH with a cost basis of $20.4k and an unrealized profit of +43.6%.\n\nSince the classic LTH cohort includes long-dormant, lost, and deep HODLed supply, much of which carries tremendous unrealized profit, it is likely that it underestimates the true acquisition price of the average high conviction investor. As such, it suggests that much of the Bitcoin market still remains underwater on their holdings, and that the damage of the 2022 bear market still plays a meaningful role in guiding investor decisions.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nFinally, we see a very interesting divergence between SOPR variants within this cohort:\n\n🟡 6m-12m SOPR describes investors acquiring coins between Aug 2022 (post LUNA and 3AC collapsing) and Feb of 2023. This group is currently locking in an average profit of +27% (cycle low buyers).\n🟤 1-2y SOPR describes investors from Aug 2021 to Aug 2022, whom are still locking in losses over -21% on average (largely cycle top buyers).\n🟣 2y-3y SOPR is oscillating around break-even, and captures investors from Aug 2020 to Aug 2021 with prices ranging from $10k through to $64k (the bull market buyers).\n\nThis demonstrates that a great majority of LTHs are actually transacting at a loss, and only those from the 6m-1y age group are in a meaningful degree of profit.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nVolatility in the digital asset space remains historically low, with investors reaching an all-time-low in willingness to spend coins on-chain. The conditions of the Bitcoin market continue to resemble the bear market hangover seen in prior cycles, with an outsized wealth held by long-term high conviction holders.\n\nHowever, with this low volatility comes apathy and exhaustion, which often entails a relatively weak influx of demand. The Realized Cap is climbing, but only very slightly, suggesting a very boring, choppy, sideways market may remain on the road ahead. This is likely compounded by the fact a large majority of the Bitcoin market is still underwater on their holdings, and likely to create resistance throughout the recovery.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Whilst options markets reflect this, it suggests that Bitcoin is either no longer infamously volatile... or volatility could be mispriced.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nAug 7, 2023 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBitcoin prices are infamously volatile, however the market is currently experiencing an extreme volatility compression. Fewer than 5% of trading days have a tighter trade range.\nFutures markets are notably flat, with trade volumes for BTC and ETH both probing all-time-lows, and cash-and-carry yields of 5.3% just slightly above the risk free rate.\nImplied volatility in options markets is undergoing a significant volatility crush, with volatility premiums trading at less than half the 2021-22 baseline.\nBoth the put/call ratio, and the 25-delta skew metrics are at all-time-lows, suggesting options markets favour calls, and put options have priced in very light volatility ahead.\n📊\nThe Week On-chain Dashboard contains all charts covered in this edition.\nA Quiet Patch\n\nBitcoin markets are experiencing an incredibly quiet patch, with several measures of volatility collapsing towards all-time lows. In this edition, we will explore just how remarkable this quiet period is from a historical standpoint, and then explore how this is being priced into derivatives markets.\n\nTo set the scene, we note that the BTC spot price is trading above a number of long-term moving averages (111D, 200D, 365D and 200W) which are widely observed across the industry. These averages range from a low of $23.3k (200DMA) up to $28.5k (111DMA). This chart also highlights similar periods over the past two cycles which tend to align with macro uptrends.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can see a very similar context using on-chain realized prices which model the cost basis for three cohorts:\n\n🟠 Entire market (the realized price).\n🔴 Short-Term Holders (coins younger than 155-day).\n🔵 Long-Term Holders (coins older than 155-day).\n\nThe spot price is again trading above all three models and demonstrates a strong confluence with the classic technical analysis tools above.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIt has been 842-days since the bull market peak was set in April 2021 (see note below). The 2023 recovery is actually faring somewhat better than the last two cycles, trading -54% below the ATH, compared with -64% historically.\n\nWe also note that both the 2015-16 and 2019-20 cycles experienced a 6-month period of sideways boredom before the market accelerated above the -54% drawdown level. This is perhaps an indication of the boredom which may lie ahead.\n\nNote: we proposed the idea that the May 2021 sell-off was in fact the start of bear market sentiment from observing bearish divergences in WoC 4-22 and WoC 8-22.\nLive Chart\n\nAfter a blazing hot start to 2023, both the quarterly and monthly price performance has cooled off. We can again see many similarities to prior cycles where the initial rally off the bottom is powerful, but leads into an extended period of choppy consolidation.\n\nThis period is often referred to as the re-accumulation period by Bitcoin analysts.\n\nLive Chart\nVolatility Collapses\n\nBitcoin realized volatility ranging from 1-month to 1-year observation windows has fallen dramatically in 2023, reaching multi-year lows. The 1y volatility window is now at levels not seen since December 2016. This is the fourth such period of extreme volatility compression:\n\nThe late stage 2015 bear into the 2016 re-accumulation period.\nThe late stage 2018 bear which preceded a 50% sell-off in Nov. This was however followed by the Apr 2019 recovery rally, rising from $4k to $14k over three months.\nPost March 2020 consolidation as the world adjusted to the outbreak of COVID-19.\nThe 2022 end of year break as the market digested the FTX failure, and our current market (see WoC 2-23 for our analysis in January 2023).\nLive Chart\n\nThe price range which separates the 7-day high and low is just 3.6%. Just 4.8% of all trading days have ever experienced a tighter weekly trade range.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe 30-day price range is even more extreme, constricting price to just a 9.8% band over the last month, and with only 2.8% of all months being tighter. Periods of consolidation and price compression at this magnitude are extremely rare events for Bitcoin.\n\n🧰\nRelated Dashboard: Several popular technical analysis and volatility tools are available in this dashboard, built using our Workbench product.\nLive Chart\nFutures Flatten Out\n\nThis quiet spell is also visible across derivatives markets for both BTC and ETH. The combined Futures and Options trade volume for the two assets are at, or approaching all-time-lows for Ethereum and Bitcoin, respectively.\n\nBTC is currently seeing $19.0B in aggregate derivatives trade volume, whilst ETH markets have just $9.2B/day, taking out the Jan-2023 lows.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe market is also maintaining a relatively risk off stance, with Bitcoin dominance within futures markets grinding slowly higher. Throughout 2021-22, Ethereum futures markets experienced a steady increase in both trade volume and open interest relative to Bitcoin, peaking at a 60 BTC : 40 ETH split in H2-2022.\n\nThis year has seen the scales tilt back in favour of Bitcoin, suggesting lighter liquidity and a reduced risk appetite remains a force moving capital up the risk curve.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: The Perpetual Futures dashboard covers several metrics comparing futures leverage, volumes, and liquidations for BTC and ETH.\nLive Chart\n\nOpen interest Bitcoin in futures markets has also been relatively flat at $12.1B over the last month. These are similar levels to the second half of 2022 when prices were ~30% cheaper than today and the FTX exchange was still active. It is also similar to during the Jan-2021 run-up when prices were 30% higher, the market was less mature, and leveraged speculation was only just heating up.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOn a comparative basis, Options markets have seen a significant uptick in dominance and growth, with open interest more than doubling over the last 12-months. Options now rival futures markets in terms of open interest magnitude.\n\nFutures open interest on the other hand has been in steady decline since late 2022 (when FTX collapsed), and has only seen a slightly increase in 2023.\n\nLive Chart\nImplied Volatility Crush\n\nWith so little trade volume and lacklustre activity in futures markets, the next goal is to identify which opportunities are keeping traders active in the digital asset derivatives space.\n\nIn futures markets, the term structure indicates that an annualized yield of between 5.8% and 6.6% is available via a cash-and-carry strategy. This however is only a very slight premium over yields available in short-term US Treasury Bills, or money market funds.\n\nLive Chart\n\nPerpetual swap markets are by far the most liquid trading venue for digital assets, and traders and market makers can lock in a funding rate premium to arbitrage the futures and spot prices. This form of cash-and-carry is more volatile and dynamic, but currently yields a more attractive 8.13% annualized to account for this additional risk.\n\nOf note is the sustained positive uptick in funding rates since January, signalling a marked change in sentiment since late 2022.\n\nLive Chart\n\nMoving across to options markets, and we can see just how severe the volatility crush has been, with implied volatility across all contract expirations collapsing to all-time lows.\n\nBitcoin markets are infamously volatile, with options trading at an implied volatility between 60% to over 100% for the majority of 2021-22. However at present, options are pricing in the smallest volatility premium in history, with IV between 24% and 52%, less than half of the long-term baseline.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: All options metrics available on Glassnode are available in our dashboard for Bitcoin and Ethereum markets.\nLive Chart\n\nThe IV term structure shows that over the last two weeks, volatility premiums are contracting. The December contract has seen implied volatility fall from 46% to 39% over the last two weeks alone. Options with an expiration out to June 2024 carry a volatility premium of just over 50%, which is historically low.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Put/Call Ratio across both volume and open interest metrics are at, or near all-time lows, trading between 0.42 and 0.48. This suggests that there is a net bullish sentiment within in the market, and demand for call options continues to dominate.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs a result, put options are increasingly cheap relative to calls, reflected by an all-time-low in the 25-delta skew metric. Overall, this indicates that options markets, which now rival futures markets in size, are pricing in historically low volatility on the road ahead.\n\nHowever, given fewer than 5% of all trading days have seen a similar price range contraction, this suggests Bitcoin is either no longer infamously volatile...or volatility could be mispriced.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nFew news headlines proclaim Bitcoin to be a price-stable and non-volatile asset, which makes monthly trade ranges of less than 10% stand out like a sore thumb. The market is arguably the least volatile it has ever been, calling into question whether heightened volatility is indeed ahead.\n\nFutures cash-and-carry yields range between 5.3% and 8.1% which are marginally above the risk free rate of short-dated US T-bills. Options markets have priced in the lowest implied volatility premium in history, with put options in particular seeing the lightest demand.\n\nGiven the context of Bitcoin's infamous volatility, is a new era of BTC price stability upon us, or is volatility mispriced?\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

With MKR and COMP experiencing significant out-performance in recent weeks, we explore how we can extract information from changes in DEX liquidity.\n\nGlassnode, Alice Kohn\nJul 31, 2023 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nSeveral positive developments in the digital asset industry, as well as developments within the DeFi sector has spurred renewed interest from investors in DeFi tokens.\nThe uptick in DeFi token interest has sparked the interest of market makers, who have increased liquidity in the respective pools, indicating a positive outlook for trading and price activities around these token.\nFurther analysis of Uniswap's trading volume distribution reveals that a significant portion of trading activity can be attributed to bots, which primarily focus on ETH-Stablecoin pairs.\nAltcoins Back in Favour?\n\nDuring the past few months, altcoin markets have seen a tug-of-war between positive and negative news events, driven by several key developments:\n\nIn early June, the SEC labelled 68 cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities, putting a damper on market interest in altcoins outside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Many of these tokens had seen poor performance even prior to this news, which we covered in our report 'Dealing With The DeFi Downtrend'.\nThe Bitcoin spot ETF filings by financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity resulted in an uptick in market sentiment, spilling over beyond Bitcoin and into the wider digital asset space.\nMoreover, the verdict of the Ripple Labs vs. SEC case in mid-July, which ruled that the crypto company did not violate federal securities law by selling its XRP token on public exchanges, sent a positive signal for other US-based crypto projects and the industry in general. The XRP victory provided a degree of hope for altcoin investors regarding robustness against further regulatory action.\n\nIn particular, tokens related to the DeFi sector have seen the strongest performance, with our DeFi index price rallying 56% since the low set on 11-June. Other key market sectors such as GameFi and Staking have under-performed by comparison.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nOur DeFi index consists of the top 8 DeFi tokens by market cap, and has established an almost two-month-long uptrend relative to ETH. This is the first outperformance since September 2022, and with very similar performance thus far.\n\nLive Chart\n\nHowever, if we look at the top eight DeFi tokens separately, two tokens stand out as primary drivers of this trend: MKR and COMP. Upon closer examination, we can seet that the performance may well be closely related to new project fundamentals, rather than wider market developments.\n\nOn June 28th, Compound's founder and CEO, Robert Leshner, announced his departure from the lending protocol as well as the launch of a new project that focuses on bringing regulated finance to blockchain networks. Following this announcement, the COMP token surged by up to 83% in one week.\n\nAround the same time, MakerDAO activated its Smart Burn Engine, a buyback program which uses excess DAI owned by the protocol to purchase MKR from a Uniswap pool. The prospect of removing approximately $7 million worth of MKR in one month caused the token's price to increase by up to 43% on the week.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nBy examining the DEX vs. CEX exchange flows for the top eight DeFi tokens, we can see a renewed interest in DEX activity. The relative share of volume traded on DEXs has increased from 3.75% at the beginning of June to 29.2% today, close to the highs seen during the second half of 2022.\n\nMixed Types of Uniswap Trading\n\nWith this uptick in DEX activity, we can investigate how these recent developments have impacted DEX activity and any potential implications for stakeholders. Our primary focus will be on Uniswap, the leading DEX, which has also been the most significant consumer of gas in the past week.\n\nIn terms of Uniswap trading volume on Ethereum, the current level of $5.57B/week remains significantly lower than in previous years. There was a volume surge related to interest around Liquid Staking Tokens earlier in 2023, as well as a brief uptick in 'meme-token' which has since faded out.\n\nFrom this lens, we can see that the recent excitement around the BTC ETF filings and the Ripple vs. SEC verdict has not sparked an appreciable increase in trading activity on Uniswap.\n\nBy examining the distribution of Uniswap trade volume across different Layer 2s, we get a clearer picture. It becomes apparent that an appreciable portion of trading has shifted from the Ethereum mainnet across to Arbitrum, attracting up to 32% of volume in March. This trend has remained elevated in June and July, which provides a degree of reasoning for the lower volume on Ethereum we observed above.\n\nBots vs. Humans\n\nAnother way to contextualize Uniswap trading activity is to look at the type of trader executing it. Since 2019, we have seen the emergence of various types of MEV bots, which are automated programs that monitor the blockchain to detect lucrative trades to exploit. For the purposes of this analysis, we will focus only on two types; Arbitrage and Sandwich bots.\n\nArbitrage bots aim to profit from price differences between the same token-pair across various DEXs and CEXs.\nSandwich bots work by inserting their trades in front of the target trader (assume a buyer) which causes an execution at a wider spread. After this, the sandwich bot will sell the asset again to close the spread, maximising value on both sides.\n\nThe chart below displays the proportion of volume on Uniswap (on Ethereum) that comes from bot trading versus human trading.\n\nWe observe that Sandwich bots generally account for more than 60% of daily volume. The volume share of Arbitrage bots has decreased from roughly 20% to 10% since the beginning of the year. Meanwhile, the share of volume created by human traders has increased up to 30% since the beginning of July, aligning with the period of increased interest in DeFi tokens.\n\nPlease note that this clustering is the product of a the first iteration of newly developed heuristics at Glassnode, which are still under active development. For this iteration, we have created rather conservative criteria for labelling bots, especially in regards to Arbitrage bots.\n\nFurthermore take note that different types of bots create different amounts of transactions and volume. For example, a sandwich bot executes at least two trades, creating twice as much trading volume in one trading action as a human trader.\n\nSince the volume can be inflated differently by different type of bot attacks, the daily number of trades by trader types provides a another view into the comparison.\n\nWe can see that human traders were very active during major events such as the USDC depeg or the meme-token mania. With greater price volatility and an influx of 'target traders', both Arbitrage and Sandwich bots follow suit, becoming up to three times as active during these upticks in human trading.\n\nThe interactive chart below displays the preferred token and pool for each type of trader, with all three trader types clearly prefer the largest and most liquid trading pairs ETH-USDC and ETH-USDT.\n\nLiquidity Pools as Information Markets\n\nSince the introduction of Uniswap V3, liquidity providers could distribute liquidity within specific price ranges within the pool. Rather than spreading liquidity across an infinite price range, liquidity could be more efficiently concentrated around price ranges where the investor expects the highest trade volumes (to capture fees).\n\nSource: Uniswap\n\nSince the announcement of the Maker buyback program, the most successful liquidity pool for Maker on Uniswap V3 was the MKR/WETH pool, which has experienced a noteworthy increase in liquidity.\n\nWhilst the pool has traditionally held mostly MKR funds, the liquidity depth of WETH has risen by over 700%. This suggests that liquidity providers are signalling an expectation of higher trade volumes for the MKR-WETH pair.\n\nUpon examining the composition of the pool, we can clearly see an increase in the share of WETH, which now accounts for 21.2% of the total. This is the result of traders increasingly purchasing MKR with WETH, indicating a clear rise in demand for MKR since the start of June.\n\nAs a final note, we propose an idea on how the liquidity pools of Uniswap could function as a form of information market for the expected price development of tokens. If we take a closer look at MKR-WETH liquidity which is placed out of range, we can clearly see that liquidity is elevated at price ticks much higher than the MKR/ETH exchange rate.\n\nAs liquidity providers move their capital up to higher price ranges, they are in a way expressing a form of out-of-the-money option on fee revenue at higher price points. Under the assumption liquidity providers are rational profit-seeking actors, the movement of their liquidity may provide option-market like insight into the expected volatility and expected range for the token of interest.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe regulatory environment surrounding digital assets has been back-and-forth in 2023, with a varied split of positive and negative news. Over recent weeks, DeFi tokens in particular have experienced out-performance, led by MKR and COMP. However after examining trading activities on Uniswap, it appears that these price increase have not been reflected in an uptick in DEX trading activities.\n\nAn explanation for this is both a growing share of trade volume occurring on L2s like Arbitrum, but also by a lighter presence of human traders. With fewer human trades, there is an equally light degree of arbitrage and sandwich bot activity.\n\nIn the case of MKR, there has been a notable uptick in market makers providing liquidity in Uniswap pools, signaling a degree of anticipation for increased trade volumes. From this, we propose a concept whereby the distribution of liquidity may well provide information into the expected trade ranges for the token in question.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nWhale Watching\n\nWhale entities for Bitcoin are often cited as key parties that can have an outsized influence on price performance. In this edition, we isolate out Whale activity, which has seen a dramatic uptick over recent months, and develop a suite of tools to track their behavior.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nJul 24, 2023 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThrough observations of the balance change of various on-chain entities, we isolate whales (1k+ BTC) as one of the primary cohorts interacting with exchanges in recent weeks.\nThe dominance of whale inflow volumes to exchanges is significant, accounting for 41% of the total. Of this, over 82% of whale inflows are destined for Binance, the largest exchange in the industry.\nWe can also identify that many of these active whale entities are classified as Short-Term Holders, with notable activity around local market peaks/troughs.\nFrom this, we develop a set of indicators to help monitor their on-chain behavior, seeking to spot periods of outsized profit or loss-taking events.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nWhale Watching\n\nAs the market first attempted to break above $30k in mid-April, the balance of most wallet size cohorts entered a regime of distribution which lasted through mid-June. This pattern began to shift during the second rally to $30k in late June.\n\nThe Trend Accumulation Score by Cohort below shows that the smallest entities (<100 BTC) have slowed down their spending over the last month. On the other hand, the whale subdivisions (>1k BTC) demonstrated divergent behaviour, with >10k BTC whales distributing and 1k-10k accumulating at a significantly higher rate.\n\nLive Engine Room\n\nWe explored the long-term behavior of whales in our recent report titled The Shrimp Supply Sink. In this piece, we demonstrated that Whale entities have seen their aggregate balance decline throughout Bitcoins history. The chart below reinforces this, with Whale entities accounting for 46% of the total supply, down from 63% in early 2021.\n\nIt is important to note that here, Whale entities will include exchanges, as well as large centralized holdings such as ETF products, GBTC, WBTC, and corporate holdings like Microstrategy.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTo remove Exchanges from the dataset, we can isolate only coins flowing between Whale entities and exchanges. The chart below shows that the aggregate Whale balance has declined by 255k BTC since 30 May.\n\nThis is the largest monthly balance decline in history, hitting -148k BTC/month. This indicates that there are noteworthy shifts happening within the Bitcoin Whale cohort worth diving deeper into.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nWhale Reshuffling\n\nTo explore the divergence within the whale cohort, we can observe changes in the supply owned by each sub-cohort over the last 30-days:\n\n🔴 Whales with >100K BTC have seen a balance increase of +6.6k BTC.\n🔵 Whales with 10k-100k BTC have reduced their balance by -49.0k BTC.\n🟢 1k-10k Whales have seen a balance increase of around +33.8k BTC.\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nAcross all whale groups (including exchanges), we can see a net reduction of just -8.7k BTC over the last month. Despite the extreme values shown in the Trend Accumulation Score, whale entities have been somewhat neutral in recent months.\n\nWe have a case where:\n\nWhale inflows to exchanges is historically large, with 255k BTC flowing from whales to exchanges.\nInternally, whale sub-cohorts are seeing balances shift in size by between -49k to +33.8k BTC.\nIn aggregate, the whale group has seen just -8.7k BTC in net outflows.\n\nSince the aggregate balance change is relatively flat, yet there are significant changes taking place both internally and via exchange flows, it is highly possible that these whale entities are moving funds internally. We will refer to this as ‘Whale Reshuffling.’\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nTo test this Whale Reshuffling hypothesis, we can investigate the 30-day position change for whale subdivisions (>10K BTC 🟥 and 1k-10k BTC 🟦). Our goal is to find periods where one group sees a balance increase, whilst the other sees a similar scale decrease.\n\nIn the chart below, we have highlighted the periods where a strong inverse correlation of -0.55 or less 🟩 can be identified. We can see that such an interval coincided with the recent market surge toward the $30k range.\n\nThus suggests that whales have indeed exhibited a relatively neutral balance change of late, with much of their recent activity being reshuffling via exchanges.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nWhales and Exchanges\n\nWith this whale behavior in mind, we can now try to observe any impacts on the market, with a focus on exchanges. The next chart can be used to analyse the relationship between whale entities and exchanges via two traces:\n\n🟪 BTC-denominated exchange inflows attributed to whales\n🔵 Percent of all inflows attributed to whales.\n\nDuring the recent rally, whale inflow volumes to exchanges picked up quite significantly, hitting +16.3k BTC/day. This is a whale dominance of 41% of all exchange inflows, which is comparable to both the LUNA crash (39%) and the failure of FTX (33%).\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nAnalysis of the Whale Netflow to Exchanges can be used as a proxy for their influence on the supply and demand balance. Whale-to-exchange netflows have tended to oscillate between ±5k BTC/day over the last five years.\n\nHowever, throughout June and July this year, whale inflows have sustained an elevated inflow bias of between 4.0k to 6.5k BTC/day.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nWe will return to a simple correlation tool to identify periods where whales dominate the global exchange netflow to exchanges. The chart below shows periods with a high correlation (0.75 or more) between Whale netflows and global exchange netflows 🟥 (suggesting whale dominance), with three key periods visible:\n\nThe 2017 bull into the 2018 bear market (market transition and maturation).\nThe post-March 2020 period (institutional adoption and expansion of GBTC).\nLate 2021 into 2022 (the unfortunate malfeasance of the FTX/Alameda entity).\n\nFrom this view, we can again see that Whale behavior (strong inflow bias) is quite divergent from the rest of the market (modest outflow bias).\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nArguably the most interesting component of this story is the destination of whale coins. If we break down whale inflow volumes, we can see that around 82% of whale-to-exchange flows are heading into Binance 🟨, while Coinbase 🟦 accounts for 6.8%, and all other exchanges account for 11.2%.\n\nThis implies that almost 34% of whale inflows during the July rally were sent into Binance, with an extraordinary uptick in Binance dominance visible over the last 12 months. This also speaks to some of the regional divergences we observed in prior weeks (WoC 26).\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nShort-Term Whales\n\nHaving established that whale entities are dominating exchange activity at present, we can connect these observations to last week's report, where we noted that most exchange activity was linked to Short-Term Holders (WoC 29).\n\nShort-Term Holder Dominance across Exchange Inflows has exploded to 82%, which is now drastically above the long-term range over the last five years (typically 55% to 65%). From this, we can establish a case that much of the recent trading activity is driven by Whales active within the 2023 market (and thus classified as STHs).\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nIf we look at the degree of Profit/Loss realized by Short-Term Holder volume flowing into exchanges, it becomes evident that these newer investors are trading local market conditions. Each rally and correction since the FTX fallout has seen a 10k+ BTC uptick in STH profit or loss, respectively.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nWe can see this behavior even clearer by looking at the net profit/loss bias for coins sent to exchanges by the STH cohort. Here, we can see local market extremes see STHs locking in a high degree of profit 🟥, or loss 🟩, indicated by this metric trading above or below ±0.3, respectively.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nShort-Term Holder SOPR 🟠 is another powerful tool to provide confluence for this local trading behavior in spot markets. SOPR tracks the ratio between the average spending price (disposal) and the acquisition price for Short-Term Holders' coins.\n\nThe following chart employs one standard deviation bands (90-day) to periods where excess profit or loss is realized. We can see several instances where these pricing bands were breached around 2023 local market extremes.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nFinally, we can combine these observations using Workbench to develop a tool which highlights when both of these conditions are met:\n\nSTH SOPR is trading above the mean + 1sd band (90-day).\nRelative net STH profit/loss bias to exchanges exceeds 0.3.\n\nThis tool can help to identify when the STH cohort is locking in a large degree of profit relative to recent history. There have been several such events throughout 2023, with many establishing local market peaks.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWhale entities for Bitcoin are often cited as being a key influence on market price action. Whilst it is quite challenging to track and monitor these entities, they appear to be increasingly active in recent months. In particular, 42% of exchange inflows are related to whale entities, with a super-majority of these destined for Binance.\n\nWe can also deduce that most of the active whale entities are classified as Short-Term Holders. By combining these observations, we can develop a suite of tools to track periods of strong profit and loss realization by this cohort. From this, we can develop a set of tools to help navigate local market extremes using on-chain data.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nChoppy and Sideways\n\nDespite BTC setting a temporary yearly price high of $31.7k, the Bitcoin market remains constrained within an extremely tight trading range. Several metrics indicate a slow and steady capital inflow, with many resembling the choppy market conditions seen in the 2016 and 2019-20 periods.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nJul 17, 2023 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nDespite BTC setting a temporary yearly price high of $31.7k, the market remains extremely quiet, with the Bollinger Bands now separated by a price range of just 4.2%.\nThe realized cap is hovering just below $400B, experiencing a steady but slow inflow of capital into digital assets, led primarily by the major two assets BTC and ETH.\nThe market is firmly within a regime of profit dominance, however the magnitude of USD value locked in remains near cycle lows, and investors remain unwilling to part with their held supply.\nSeveral metrics now resemble the choppy market conditions seen in the 2016 and 2019-20 periods.\nSlow and Steady Inflows\n\nThe digital asset market continues to see remarkably little volatility, with the classic 20-day Bollinger Bands experiencing an extreme squeeze. Despite setting a temporary yearly high of $31.7k this week, the rally failed to sustain momentum, bringing BTC prices back into the sideways trading range above $30.0k.\n\nA price range of just 4.2% separates the upper and lower Bollinger bands, making this is the quietest BTC market since the lull in early January.\n\n📈\nRelated Dashboard: Several classic technical analysis models are available in the Technical Analysis Toolbox dashboard.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nBeneath the surface, capital is still flowing into digital assets at a steady and modest rate. The Realized Cap is one of the oldest and most widely observed on-chain metrics, and provides a powerful tool for assessing the true capital flows into Bitcoin. It is best thought of as the ‘on-chain Market Cap’, and reflects the cumulative sum of all realized profit and loss events through history.\n\nThe Realized Cap currently sits just shy of $400B and has indicates that a steady stream of capital is entering the asset throughout 2023. As the realized cap climbs, it signals that coins are changing hands at higher prices on net, suggesting a modest uptick in new demand inflow this year.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nDuring bear markets, Bitcoin usually experiences significant capital outflows, as investors lock in losses. The realized cap drawdown in 2022 reached the second deepest value of -18.8%, demonstrating the magnitude of the bear market. Recovery of the realized cap ATH in prior cycles have taken between 95 and 239-days, with the recovery so far occurring at a similar rate.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nShifts in demand liquidity can also be assessed via the Net Realized Profit / Loss (NRPL) metric, which is the first derivative of the Realized Cap.\n\nNRPL has traded within a profit dominated regime through much of 2023, seeing around $270M/day in net inflows (profits minus losses). This reflects the first sustained profit regime since April 2022. This is similar in scale to both the first half of 2019, and also late 2020, which is a comparison which this report will show from several angles.\n\nOf note is how significantly smaller this regime is compared the 2021 bull market which reached extraordinary peaks of over $3.68B/day.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIf we take a ratio between total realized profit and loss, we can see that 2023 has been an explosive and positive year thus far, breaking firmly above the breakeven level of 1.0 in early January.\n\nHowever, we can also note that a lower high in this ratio was set this week. If sustained, it may allude to similar choppy market conditions seen in both 2019-20, and again in the second half of 2021. Lower peaks in this metric generally suggest a marginal softening of capital inflows, which in the past has preceded a longer period of time to digest the recovery.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can also gauge shifts across the wider digital asset market by comparing the Bitcoin and Etheruem Realized Caps, with the supply of the top stablecoins. By this measure we can see that most capital flows have come in via the two majors BTC and ETH, both seeing inflows of +$21.9B and $18.0B YTD, respectively.\n\nStablecoins however have seen a net reduction of -$10.4B in aggregate supply, led largely by USDC and BUSD redemptions. This trend is now firmly in place, suggesting a notable market preference for the big two digital assets over stablecoin capital.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nThe Incentive to Spend\n\nSOPR is another powerful tool, useful for for tracking the magnitude of profit and loss taking events across the market. Here, we define a framework consisting of two binary regimes to characterise market behaviour:\n\nLoss Dominant Regime: Successive prints below 1.0 are indicative of investors locking in losses, and returns to the breakeven level are often utilized as exit point (forming resistance).\nProfit Dominant Regime: Successive SOPR prints above 1.0 indicates a return of profit taking, and returns to the breakeven level are often considered a near term point of value (forming support).\n\nSOPR currently resides within a profit dominant regime, recording a value of 1.06, indicating the average coin changing hands is locking in a 6% profit. This again has similar characteristics to the 2016 and 2019 periods.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWith this in mind, the breakdown of exchange inflow volumes suggest that Short-Term Holders (STH) are the primary entities that are active in the market. Out of the total 39.6k BTC in daily exchange inflows, 78% of this is associated with the STH cohort, being those investors that have been active since early February.\n\n💱\nRelated Dashboard: Several metrics related to breaking down Exchange inflows by cohort are available in the Exchanges and Cohorts dashboard.\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nThis makes sense when we contextualize the proportion of STH supply that is held in profit, which is now just over 88% of their total balance. This is above the mean plus one standard deviation level, and is historically associated with macro uptrends where the incentive to take profits is high.\n\nAs prices rise, the STH cohort are becoming increasingly likely to spend and take profits.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nIf we compare this to the Long-Term Holder cohort (LTHs), we can see their position is comparatively less extreme, with just over 73% of their balance held in profit. This indicates that around a quarter of all LTH supply was acquired at prices above than $30k and within the 2021-22 cycle (as covered in last weeks edition WoC 28).\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nIf we breakdown the realized value locked in by the market, we can see the strength of the 2023 recovery thus far. Both LTHs and STHs are now seeing the super-majority (73%) of their spending locking in a profit.\n\nThis is a significant improvement over the extreme pain experienced after FTX failed, where 90% of all spent coins were locking in losses (the deepest capitulation in history by this measure).\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nHowever, if we view this from the lens of total USD denominated realized value (profit plus loss), it remains near cycle lows of just $290M/day. Whilst this is a significant sum on a nominal basis, it is again comparable to the 2019 peak, and to October 2020 where BTC prices were 50% lower than they currently are.\n\nAs such, it suggests that even though the Bitcoin market cap is ~2x larger today, investors who are holding large profits or losses are extremely unwilling to spend their coins on-chain.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nOverall, this suggests that the vast majority of Bitcoin holders are sitting tight, and are opting not to revalue their holdings. This speaks to our prior report (WoC 26) where the proportion of liquid, mobile and active BTC available on the market remains remarkably small.\n\nSeeing the Light\n\nTo close this edition, we will call back to our report from just over a year ago titled The Darkest Phase of the Bear (WoC 24-2022, June 2022). In this report, we introduced a metric which helps identify large scale shifts in LTH and STH behavior.\n\nIt is uncommon for the LTH cohort to spend coins that have a higher average cost basis (lower profit multiple) than the STH cohort. However, such events do occur, and are historically associated with deep bear market capitulation events. These are periods where even the strongest hands are purged from the market, in particular those that acquired coins near the cycle top and then weathered the full duration of the downtrend.\n\nWith the strong price performance YTD, and the dominance of STH spending this week, this SOPR ratio has commenced its second leg down. This provides a macro scale view on a reversal in investor behavior. There has only been one instance in March 2020 where an 'echo bounce' occurred in this metric, pushing back above 1.0 before spending a multi-year period below it.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nDespite setting a temporarily new yearly high of $31.7k this week, BTC prices continue to trade within a very tight trading range. This has resulted in an extreme tightening of the Bollinger Bands, separated by just 4.2%. This compression in volatility is matched by cyclical lows in realized profit and loss being locked in by the market.\n\nThe Short-Term Holder cohort dominates the inflows into exchanges at present, incentivised by over 88% of supply now being in profit. However on the broader scale, investors appear remarkably unwilling to let go of their supply. In many ways, this resembles periods like 2016 and 2019-20, characterised by choppy market conditions.",

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nStuck in the Middle\n\nBitcoin prices have reached the $30k 'mid-point' of the 2021-22 cycle, with several metrics approaching levels associated with the 're-accumulation period' seen in past cycles. Inscriptions are cooling off, however monetary transactions are picking up steam once again.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJul 10, 2023 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nBitcoin prices are consolidating around the $30k mid-point of the 2021-23 cycle, with YTD price performance remaining historically strong.\nInscriptions have cooled off significantly and Bitcoin network congestion is starting to clear. However monetary transfer volumes are increasing, now up +75% since the November lows.\nThe balance of supply held in-profit vs in-loss has reached an equilibrium point synonymous with the several month long 're-accumulation period' seen in past cycles.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nHolding Up OK\n\nThe Bitcoin market has held onto the majority of its 2023 gains thus far, rallying back above $31k in recent weeks. With the market consolidating near the yearly highs, we can compare this price performance to prior cycles, from both a bull and a bear market lens.\n\nIf we assume that the November 2022 lows are indeed the cycle floor, we can compare the depth of the 'bull market corrections' thus far. We can see that the peak drawdown in 2023 has been just -18%, which is remarkably shallow compared to all prior cycles. This perhaps suggests a relatively strong degree of demand underlies the asset.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIf we instead put our bear market goggles on, we can assess 2023 performance indexed from the cycle ATH. From this vantage point, the powerful recovery from the November lows is up 91%, and carries a remarkable resemblance to the recovery rallies of prior cycles.\n\nWith the exception of 2019, all prior cycles which experienced a similar magnitude move off the bottom, were in fact the genesis point of a new cyclical uptrend.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nInscriptions Give Way to Investors\n\nOne of the most surprising events of 2023 has been the emergence of ordinals and inscriptions on Bitcoin. This phenomena has experienced two distinct waves of activity:\n\nWave 1: Primarily image based inscriptions, leading to the emergence of NFT assets on Bitcoin. A total of 1.08M images have been inscribed thus far.\nWave 2: Primarily high fee paying text based inscriptions associated with 'BRC-20 tokens'. Overall, Bitcoin now hosts 14.8M text based inscriptions.\n\nBy inscription count, Wave 2 was an order of magnitude larger, however activity has been in consistent decline since May. There has been a brief uptick in text inscriptions this week, however unconfirmed transactions across Bitcoin mempools are starting to clear overall.\n\nAvailable in this Professional Dashboard\n\nInscriptions also forced a very intriguing development in our interpretation framework of on-chain activity metrics. Generally speaking, upticks in Bitcoin on-chain activity metrics are a signal of growing adoption and a healthy network (i.e. up is usually good to see).\n\nHowever due to the significant address re-use (WoC 20), and very small transfer volumes (~10k sats) associated with inscriptions, periods of high demand now requires a slightly more nuanced interpretation, summarised in the following table.\n\nWith this in mind, we can see that as inscriptions cool off, active address momentum has started climbing again. Traditional interpretation would have seen the last 2-3 months as an implied decline in Bitcoin network activity. However the correct interpretation is that it was simply a product of significant address re-use by inscription traders, and network activity was actually booming, with blocks being packed full.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTransaction counts also reached a previously unattainable peak, with inscriptions taking advantage of the SegWit data discount. This meant that miners could fit more transaction data into each block, with some blocks even approaching the 4MB theoretical hard limit.\n\nDaily transaction counts have also cooled off significantly in recent weeks, aligning with the slowdown in inscription activity.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAfter several months of network congestion, mempools are slowly but surely starting to clear, and on-chain transaction fees are coming off the boil. USD denominated transaction fees on Bitcoin are down over 96% since the height of the BRC-20 craze in May, with the average fee paid now at $1.33, with median fees down to $0.16.\n\nFee metrics, above all others, suggests an aggregate slowdown in on-chain activity is currently underway.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWhilst activity is cooling, BTC volumes which are being transferred are starting to pick up meaningfully. BTC changing hands has lifted 75% off the FTX lows, now reaching $4.2B per day in total settlement.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nIf we isolate only exchange inflows and outflows, we see that the Bitcoin network is entering a period of positive momentum. The monthly average of exchange flows is now firmly above the yearly, a sign that has historically suggested growing adoption from a monetary asset standpoint.\n\nWhilst several other on-chain activity metrics are cooling off, this one suggests a return back towards a dominance of BTC monetary transfers.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nFrom this exchange related activity, we can develop an NVT Price model. originally developed by Will Woo. This model seeks to imply a 'fair value' for a given amount of on-chain volume settlement.\n\nOn a short-term 28-day basis, this model implies a 'fair value' of $35.9k, which is above spot prices for the first time since November 2022. The slower 90-day model is also turning sharply higher, and playing catch up from a level of $24.7k.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nFirm Foundations\n\nThus far, we have established that the recovery of the Bitcoin market in 2023 has been remarkably robust, both from a price performance, but also from a network utilisation standpoint. The chart below helps put this into perspective, demonstrating the firm foundation of supply that was acquired at prices below $30k.\n\nWe can see that the supply cluster between $15k and $30k is quite significant, demonstrating that a large volume of coin changed hands over the last 12 months. Conversely, just 25% of the supply was acquired at prices above $30k, held by buyers from the 2021-22 cycle.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can bring the Long and Short-Term heuristic into our URPD chart, making the following observations:\n\n🔵 A sizeable volume of LTH supply was acquired between $15k and $25k (thus in profit), and remains unspent, despite prices reaching $31k.\n🔵 Almost all coins with an acquisition price above $30k are held by LTHs. These investors are the survivors of the 2021-22 bear, and are either battle hardened HODLers, or likely to create resistance should the market rally higher.\n🔴 The price range between $20k and $30k has seen expanding accumulation since February, despite the onslaught of regulatory pressure in the US.\nOverall, this supply distribution is quite 'bottom heavy' suggesting a relatively firm 'foundation' of investor holdings exists below $30k.\nAvailable in the Glassnode Engine Room\n\nWe can also see the magnitude of supply acquired during the recent correction to $25k in the chart below. The volume of supply which jumped from 'in-loss' to 'in-profit' status was around 2.47M BTC, equivalent to 12.7% of the total supply.\n\nConversely, the supply held 'in-loss' has declined to just 4.79M BTC, reaching similar levels seen in July 2021 ($30k), July 2020 ($9.2k), April 2016 ($6.5k), and March 2016 ($425).\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nStuck In the Middle\n\nBitcoin data often displays strangely repetitive patterns cycle after cycle. In the 2021-22 cycle, the $30k price level formed somewhat of a 'mid-point', and was tested several times both from above and below.\n\nA very similar level was observed in 2013-16 around the $425 level, and again in 2018-19 at approximately $6.5k. Note also that these levels were mentioned above, as points where a similar volume of supply was held 'in-loss'.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWith the market consolidating below this $30k 'mid-point', we can see that around 75% of the total supply is in-profit, and 25% is held in-loss. This is, strangely, the same balance reached as price reached the mid-points in both 2016 and 2019.\n\nIn fact, this 75:25 balance of supply held in profit:loss is the equilibrium point for Bitcoin. 50% of all trading days have seen a higher Profit-to-Loss balance, and 50% a lower one.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThis equilibrium point has historically taken time for the market to digest, and re-consolidate around. Many Bitcoin analysts refer to this as the 're-accumulation period', which tends to straddle the halving event.\n\nWe can visualize this by looking at proportion of the Market cap held at an Unrealized Loss. During the primary bear, the market is plunged deep into the red, with investors gradually capitulating out. As the market forms and then rallies off the lows, profitability sees a sharp recovery, reaching levels similar to where we are today.\n\nPrevious 're-accumulation periods' are characterised by a lack of macro market direction, tending to trade sideways (and volatile) for several months. With the market back at this equilibrium point, it remains to be seen if a similar lengthy and choppy process is needed to overcome it.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nBitcoin is currently consolidating below the 2021-22 cycle mid-point of $30k, with several metrics reaching a level of equilibrium and balance. This is synonymous with the 're-accumulation period' seen in past cycles, characterised as several months with little macro direction.\n\nPrice performance YTD has however been relatively strong, with a maximum drawdown of just -18% so far. On-chain activity for Bitcoin is cooling down somewhat, driven most by a decline in Inscription activity. Monetary transfer volumes however are starting to pick up, displaying positive momentum often associated with growing liquidity and adoption.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Surge in Liquid Staking\n\nSince the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade, a very clear market preference for liquid staking tokens has emerged. Lido's stETH maintains an impressive dominance, with DeFi capital flows suggesting it has become a preferred collateral asset.\n\nGlassnode, Alice Kohn\nJul 3, 2023 • 8 min read\nExecutive Summary\nThe introduction of Ethereum's staking withdrawal functionality in mid-April has sparked a surge in interest for liquid staking tokens.\nAmong liquid staking providers, Lido has established overwhelming dominance, boasting the highest supply, liquidity, and integration network effects, all of which solidify its position in the market.\nA new trend has evolved in regard to the DeFi integration of liquid staking tokens. Liquidity pools associated with liquid staking are witnessing a decline in locked value, as capital migrates towards use as collateral in lending protocols.\nRelative Performance\n\nThe digital asset market has been processing the slew of spot BTC ETF applications over recent weeks, with notable BTC out-performance relative to the rest of the market. Whilst the ETF filing by BlackRock initially lifted The ETH price by 11.2%, it has closed Q2 a surprisingly quiet 6.4% above its April open.\n\nOn a relative basis, many digital assets have lost ground against Bitcoin in 2023, with the ETH/BTC ratio sliding down to a 50-week low of 0.060. This ratio has rallied back to 0.063 however, showing some strength into the start of July.\n\n📈\nRelated Dashboard: Ethereum price performance relative to both USD, and BTC can be tracked in our Price Performance dashboard.\n\nThus far in 2023, the uptick in ETH prices have not yet translated into significantly increased network activity. Gas prices, which are considered a proxy for blockspace demand, have remained relatively low, especially in the week following the ETF filing announcements. For comparison, during the Shanghai upgrade in April, which preceded a similar rally in ETH markets, gas prices rose by 78%, compared the the 28% this week.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nWaves of New Staking Deposits\n\nThe Shanghai hardfork enabled staked ETH to be withdrawn from the Ethereum consensus mechanism. Rather than seeing a wave of withdrawals however, instead the upgrade has motivated a fresh wave of deposits, as stakers find confidence in this new flexibility.\n\nDeposit activity (transaction counts) reached a peak on 2-June, recording over 13,595 new deposits (worth over 408k ETH). For comparison, we can compare this to ETH exchange deposit transactions, which have remained flat at around 30k deposits transactions over this period.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThe burst of new staked ETH is even clearer if we compare ETH volume staked (blue) vs exchange inflow volume (red). Newly staked ETH has been higher, or equal in scale to exchange inflows since Shanghai went live.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nUpon closer examination, we can isolate daily deposits by provider, where a very clear trend in favor of liquid staking providers becomes evident, with Lido is leading this trend.\n\nLido Dominance\n\nThe above observations reflect a market demand for liquid staking tokens (LSTs). These tokens are effectively a wrapper for ETH deposited into the staking pool, with the staking operations abstracted away from the end user by the platform.\n\nLido released its V2 update on 15-May which allowed node operators to withdraw staked ETH, enabling holders of Lido's stETH token to exchange it for ETH. Following the release, there was a redemption of 400k stETH ($721M), resulting in a contraction of the stETH supply. However, the huge wave of new ETH deposits have more than compensated the decline, pushing to a new ATH of 7.49M stETH.\n\nWhen comparing to other liquid staking competitors, Lido stands out as the clear leader in the sector with its supply 16 times higher than its nearest competitor. That said, the supply of rETH, which is the liquid staking token of Rocketpool, has been growing three times faster than Lido's since the beginning of this year.\n\nInterestingly, the increasing demand for Lido's stETH is not reflected in an increasing number of new token holders. While we observe an increase in users of the staking tokens of Rocketpool and FRAX after the Shanghai upgrade, Lido has not registered a significant growth in new users.\n\nNew addresses holding stETH is oscillating between 230-590/day, which is more or less unchanged YTD. This leads us to the conclusion that many new deposits made via Lido are driven by existing stETH token holders increasing their exposure.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nWhen looking at the average token holder balance, we can estimate how the newly issued stETH tokens have been distributed. After withdrawals were enabled for Lido, the average balance of token holders dropped to 46.1 stETH ($83k).\n\nThe average stETH balance has increased to 51.0 stETH ($100k) since Shanghai, indicating that existing token holders are indeed increasing their share of ETH staked in the form of stETH. It also suggests we are yet to see an appreciable influx of new holders entering the market via these staking mechanisms.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nShifting LST Usage in DeFi\n\nA key value proposition of LSTs is their integration into DeFi protocols. LST token holders can easily trade LSTs on decentralized exchanges, use them as collateral, or take advantage of yield opportunities via lending protocols.\n\nSince their inception, LSTs have seen increased activity within different DeFi protocols, with Lido's stETH being the most significant. The network effects and integrations of stETH is another factor leading to Lido dominance in the sector. However, amongst the suite of DeFi protocols accepting LSTs, there are several interesting trends developing.\n\nSince the Shanghai Upgrade, the stETH-ETH Curve Pool, which is the largest liquidity pool for Lido's staking derivative, has lost 39% of its total value locked. It is now approaching the levels seen after the great deleveraging following the Terra-Luna collapse in May 2022.\n\nDatasource: Lido. Adjusted by Glassnode\n\nExamining the wstETH-ETH Pool on Balancer, we can observe this trend is even more pronounced. Since 15-April the TVL of this pool has decreased by 71%, reducing the pool value from $351.2M to $101.4M.\n\nDatasource: Lido. Adjusted by Glassnode\n\nBy examining the annualized yield (APR) of both pools, we can see a consistent downtrend has been established in 2023. For our analysis, we take 15-April as the reference point as it is around that time when the wave of new staking deposits began, as well as the decrease in liquidity on the relevant DEXs.\n\nThe APR for the Curve stETH-ETH pool has decreased from 3.47% on April 15th to 2.27% today. On the other hand, the Balancer pool reached its lowest point of 1.69% in April and has slightly increased to 2.10% since then.\n\nKeep in mind that APRs for liquidity pools are comprised of different reward structures paid in different tokens. The Lido project rewards Curve liquidity providers with LDO tokens on-top, with this incentive programme running out on 1-June. Given the contrasting APR trends on both platforms, this changing reward structure alone does not provide a conclusive explanation for the declining liquidity.\n\nIt may be that APRs have been rendered somewhat irrelevant for LST pools since the opening of withdrawals. Before Shanghai, liquidity pools functioned as the sole source of liquidity for stakers, however now the requirement to trade between stETH and ETH on DEXs has decreased, and users can mint or redeem directly with the platform.\n\nThis may alude to market makers seeing diminished return opportunities as DeFi liquidity providers. Moreover, this trend may have be reinforced by the retreat of several major market makers due to heightened regulatory scrutiny in the USA.\n\nDatasource: Balancer, Curve. Adjusted by Glassnode\n\nSince we do not see any sudden withdrawals of liquidity caused by the departure of a few players, but rather a continuous trend, we assume that these decreases in liquidity are likely due to more structural shifts.\n\nAnother explanation could be the increase in potential opportunity costs for liquidity providers resulting from new revenue streams across other DeFi protocols. Lending pools such as Aave or Compound which allow for LSTs can be used as collateral and leveraging them against ETH. This leveraged staking position is estimated to amplify yield by 3x.\n\nAave has seen an appreciable increase in TVL, especially for wstETH within the V3 lending pool. Since its launch in late January 2023, the wstETH pool has swelled to over S734.9M in value, whilst the stETH pool is hovering around $1.79B.\n\nDatasource: Lido. Adjusted by Glassnode\n\nThe Compound V3 wstETH pool has also seen significant growth since its launch earlier this year, now holding over $42.2M worth of stETH. This is an increase of 817% since 9-May alone. Yield-bearing staking derivatives appear to be becoming a more attractive collateral relative to ETH and even stablecoins.\n\nDatasource: Lido. Adjusted by Glassnode.\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nThe Ethereum Shanghgai upgrade was completed in mid April, allowing investors to complete the withdrawal leg of the staking yield trade. Rather than witnessing a wave of withdrawals, deposits accelerated, with a very clear market preference for liquid staking tokens emerging.\n\nOf these, Lido has captured by far the largest market share, accounting for 7.5M in staked ETH. Lido's stETH also has network effects within the DeFi sector, being integrated and adopted as a preferred source of collateral. Since Shanghai, there has been a notable shift in stETH capital allocation within the DeFi sector, with DEX liquidity pools shrinking, and collateral usage within in lending protocols rising.\n\nThis suggests that investors may be playing a staking yield maximising strategy, building up stETH exposure via borrowed leverage to amplify returns.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

In this report, we try to measure the available supply, and assess how demand impacted valuations in past cycles.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nJun 26, 2023 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nAnalyzing the fund flow attributed to top exchanges in the US and Asia, shows a strong accumulation during Asia trading hours, while the US markets have shown weaker demand in 2023.\nEmploying a framework introduced in this article, we identify periods of demand expansion (or contraction) using the concept of ‘hot supply’, which isolates the coin volume actively participating in price discovery.\nAnalysis of short-term holder behavior in 2023 suggests market psychology has shifted from the bearish environment of 2022, with the recent rally springing off their cost basis, which acted as support.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nRegional Sentiment Analysis\n\nIn recent weeks, the SEC has been applying pressure to the top two cryptocurrency exchanges in the US. However, this week saw a gold rush of spot Bitcoin ETF applications lead by Blackrock, the largest global asset manager. In response, BTC has rallied from $25k to over $31k, reaching new yearly highs.\n\nThe rally was led by traders in US 🔵, followed by traders in EU 🟠, and lastly in Asia 🔴.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can explore a framework for these regional shifts by assessing coin flows through fiat on-ramping entities (exchanges). To achieve this, we have isolated the top three exchanges from the US and Asia regions as ranked by CoinGecko.\n\nUS (On-shore): Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini\n\nAsia (Off-shore): Binance, OKX and Houbi\n\nFocusing on the weekly average BTC netflow exposes some interesting patterns in their behavior. During the early stages of the 2020-2021 bull market, the LUNA debacle and FTX fallout led to a regime of strong accumulation and preference for self-custody. Most exchanges experienced 5k-10k BTC daily net outflows.\n\nHowever, on multiple occasions, Binance demonstrated the opposite behavior, where large inflow volumes accompanied market sell-off events and downtrends. This may be, in part, investors moving holdings away from exchanges perceived as riskier (like FTX) and towards the largest exchange in the world.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can also categorize exchanges based on their headquarters (On- vs Off-shore) and then aggregated the total netflows for each subcategory.\n\nThe following chart displays the monthly cumulative netflow for each region. We can observe that both regions saw net outflows (accumulation) during the bottom discovery phase between Nov-2022 and Jan-2023. Conversely, after the LUNA debacle, and for much of 2023, Off-shore exchanges have seen net inflows, whilst On-shore exchanges are seeing net outflows, as US based investors accumulate or stay neutral.\n\nObservers can use this indicator to monitor regional market sentiment shifts as they react to external factors. For instance, after the SEC lawsuit against BinanceUS and Coinbase was announced, both regions reacted to price correction via notable exchange outflows. Currently, off-shore exchanges are showing -37.7k BTC/month in net outflows, while buying pressure in on-shore exchanges has declined to -3.2k BTC/month.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nGauging Demand Via Hot Supply\n\nOur recent newsletters highlighted the ongoing transfer of wealth from investors with high time preferences towards HODLers. This pattern of growing illiquidity is a primary component of all prior Bitcoin bull markets. However, while a ‘supply shock’ can positively affect price discovery, the sustainability of the trend still depends on the influx of new demand entering the market.\n\nGiven the demand side importance, we seek to establish a framework for tracing demand expansion (or contraction) using on-chain metrics. To achieve this goal, we will measure the momentum of supply, which is highly active as a proxy representation of demand.\n\n💡 Quantifying capital flows can be measured from changes in the size of the highly-active region of circulating supply.\n\nIn other words, when new demand enters the market, existing investors usually react by transacting and distributing their coins at higher prices. The spending of older coins 🟦, therefore, necessitates an expansion of the younger supply 🟥 region.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nWe start by defining ‘young supply’ as all coins moved within the last 155 days (Short-Term Holders), which have a high probability of being spent in the near-term. However, we can look deeper and isolate only the most liquid and highly active subset of the young supply region, which we will define as ‘Hot Supply.’\n\nHot Supply is a subdivision of young supply which has a Velocity of one or higher. A velocity of more than one means, on average, each coin in that region moves more than once per day.\n\nUsing the following formula, we can calculate the velocity of any arbitrary subdivision of coins i.\n\nVelocity_i = Daily Volume_i / Supply Size_i\n\nThe chart below shows the all-time-average velocity for the following markets:\n\nPerpetual Futures Market 🔵 (velocity = trade volume divided by open interest).\nSpot Market (<1w coins) 🔴 (velocity = on-chain volume divided by supply < 1wk).\nSpot Market (<1m coins) 🟠 (velocity = on-chain volume divided by supply < 1m).\n\nThe velocity of both perpetual futures markets, and supply < 1wk is more than one. If we consider coins from the next age bracket (1 month), velocity drops below one, reinforcing the notion that older coins have a lower probability of spending.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nTo put the magnitude of this Hot Supply 🟥 into perspective, this supply region is presented against Perpetual Open Interest 🟪, Total Circulating Supply 🟧 and (Probably) Lost Supply ⬛. The interesting takeaway is that throughout the whole history of Bitcoin, the pricing process has been driven by a relatively small fraction of the total circulating supply.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWith a median size of 0.67M BTC and a maximum of 2.2M BTC, Hot Supply represents between 3.5% to 11.3% of the total supply. This is comparable to the volume of probably lost coins (1.46M BTC ~ 7.2%), being those that have not transacted since Bitcoins first traded price in July-2010.\n\nPerpetual Futures Open Interest (472k BTC) and Hot Supply (511k BTC) are also similar in size as shown below, suggesting that a volume of around 983k BTC (~$29.5B) is currently ‘available’ for sale, with just under half of this being spot BTC.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can also demonstrate the interrelation between price action, and changes in these Hot Supply and Perpetual Open Interest components. The chart below looks at the 90-day Net Position Change in these regions, where we can identify the direction and magnitude of capital flow into 🟥 and out of 🟩 the market.\n\nThroughout past bull markets and severe capitulation events, between 250k to 500k BTC in value is typically deployed into the market. During prolonged bear markets, a similar magnitude of volume is accumulated and taken off-market long enough to exit this Hot Supply cohort (acquired and held by HODLers).\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe impact on price action arising from these expansions in hot supply is shown in the chart below. There have been seven major waves of capital inflow over the last 5yrs, ranging in magnitude from 400k BTC to 900k BTC per quarter. These were associated with market moves of between 26% to 154%.\n\nFrom this chart, we can also compare the potential impact of the liquidation of major supply sources such as the Mt. Gox funds (137k BTC) and confiscated bitcoin held by US government (204k BTC). From this, we can see that a single quarter of similar demand inflows may be capable of absorbing the full distribution from both sources.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nReacting to On-Chain Cost Basis\n\nIn our WoC 18 report, we illustrated the significance of short-term holder behaviour during cycle pivot points. Through 2023, there have been two major intersections between price and the Short Term Holders-Cost Basis 🔴 where it provided strong support.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe weekly rate of change for both the long-term 🟦 and short-term holder 🟥 cost-basis fell towards zero last week, reflecting a stable equilibrium being reached around $26k. This suggests that investor psychology has shifted away from the 2022 bear mindset, and towards a perception of break-even levels as an opportunity to build a position, rather than take exit liquidity.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can also see a strong reaction in the Short-Term Holder MVRV indicator, reacting strongly off the break-even level of MVRV = 1.\n\nThis ratio is currently at 1.12, suggesting that, on average, the short-term holder cohort is sitting on a 12% profit. The risk of market corrections tend to rise when this metric exceeds levels of between 1.2 (~$33.2k) and 1.4 (~$38.7k), as investors come into increasingly large unrealized profits.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nTo close, we look to the Short-Term Holder spending behavior YTD, presented in the STH-SOPR indicator. We have plotted upper and lower bands using 90-day ± standard deviation bands as a tool to identify likely reaction points. On multiple occasions in recent weeks, we can identify spot seller exhaustion taking place below the lower band 🟢 including the final low set at $25.1k before the recovery back above $30k.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nAs a gold rush of institutional-grade ETF applications are filed in the US, we have seen early signs of a revival of US-led demand. This comes after a period of weaker relative US demand in 2023, with top exchanges in Asia seeing the strongest accumulation year to date.\n\nWith the prospect of a new large acquirer of spot BTC on the table, we developed a framework for assessing the available volume of BTC supply, and a toolkit to assess the expansion (or contraction) of new demand.\n\nWe close by examining the behavior of the Short-Term Holder cohort, and observe that their market psychology appears to have shifted from the bear market blues of 2022. Their actions speak to a newfound perception of ‘break-even’ levels as an opportunity to add to positions, rather than to liquidate into whatever exit liquidity is available.",

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Volatile Road to Nowhere\n\nVolatility, volumes, and realized values are at multi-year lows, indicating that Bitcoin investor apathy is firmly in play. However, under the surface, HODLers continue their classic slow and steady accumulation, with the halving now less than 1yr away.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nJun 19, 2023 • 7 min read\nExecutive Summary\nVolatility, volume, and realized value are at multi-year lows, suggesting liquidity is increasingly thin, and investor apathy is now firmly in play.\nThe undercurrent of BTC supply continues to flow out of exchanges, miners and and whale wallets, and towards HODLer entities of all sizes at a healthy rate.\nComparisons to past cycles suggests that the market is likely within a transitional period, characterized by investor apathy, and boredom. However, the halving event creeps ever closer, now just 305-days away.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nThe Road to Nowhere\n\nThis week, the Bitcoin market experienced price swings in both directions, however made little progress overall. The market traded down to $24.8k early in the week, rallied to $26.7k on news of the ETF application by Blackrock, before returning almost back to the opening at $26.3k. Whilst prices were volatile intra-week, on the broader scale, the market remains on a road to nowhere.\n\nIf we compare the the 30-day price range, we can see that quiet periods like this are few and far in between. The majority tend to occur during the apathetic hangover period that follows a bear market, aligning with our observations of market apathy last week (WoC 25)\n\n💡\nRelated Dashboard: This chart is available within the Technical Analysis Toolbox dashboard, alongside the RSI, MACD, Stochastic, and Bollinger Band indicators.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nNaturally, this is also reflected across 1-month Realized Volatility, which has reset to 39.6%, one of the lowest recordings since the 2021 bull market. We can see such events are typically experienced during the long, sideways grind as the market finds its feet after a prolonged bearish trend.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nImplied volatility across option contracts from 1-week, to 6-months out have also reached a cycle lows. Near-term 1-week implied volatility is at the second lowest value (36%) on record, whilst 3-month and 6-month contracts are at all-time-lows of 42% and 46%, respectively.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTrading volumes in futures markets have also declined to $20.9B/day as liquidity across digital asset markets continues to drain.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThis phenomena is also observed across the Ethereum futures markets, suggesting that this decline in liquidity is an industry wide contraction. The only period in the last 30-months experiencing lower aggregate trade volume was during the 2022 end of year lull.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nA similar story is true on-chain, we can see the absolute value of profit and loss taking events has declined to cycle lows of $268M. This returns to October 2020 levels (BTC prices were ~$10k), highlighting just how quiet capital flows have been both in and out of the asset class year to date.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nHODLers Are HODLing\n\nWe have established that digital asset liquidity is very thin across both the on-chain and off-chain domains. In the next section, we shall investigate how this translates across to the behavior of existing market participants.\n\nLiveliness provides a big picture view into the propensity of Bitcoin holders to spend or hold their coins. Currently, Liveliness is in a multi-year macro downtrend, having peaked in May 2021 when bear market first set in. We can see a similar structure has formed to the 2018-20 cycle, as coins slowly but surely migrate into cold storage and are removed from the market by the HODLer cohort.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThese HODLers are currently accumulating coins at a rate of around 42.2K BTC/month, suggesting that the price insensitive class are absorbing a non-trivial portion of the currently available supply.\n\nIf we compare this behavior to prior cycles, we can see that this regime of steady and gradual accumulation commenced just over 2-years ago, and suggests that another 6 to 12-months may be ahead of us.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThis observation is further supported by the divergence between exchange balances, and the volume of coins held in illiquid wallets, being those with little to no history of spending. Illiquid supply reached a new ATH of 15.2M BTC this week, whilst exchange balances have fallen to the lowest levels since Jan 2018 at 2.3M BTC.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nAround 146K BTC/month are currently flowing into these illiquid wallets, supporting the case for a gradual and steady accumulation taking place.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nTo get a sense of scale, we can compare the balance change of various wallet size cohorts to the volume of new coins issued to miners.\n\nBy this relative measure, we can see that entities with a balance under 100 BTC are increasing their holdings meaningfully, absorbing an equivalent to 254% of mined supply over the last month (2.54 x ~900 BTC/day = 2,286 BTC/day).\n\n💡\nRelated Report: Absorption Rate metrics were introduced in The Shrimp Supply Sink, and can be viewed by Professional members in the Entity Balance Change dashboard.\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nShark entities (100 to 1k BTC) are also seeing positive balance change, absorbing volumes equivalent to 36% of mined supply. Whale entities on the other hand (> 1k BTC) join Miners as net distributors, releasing a volume equivalent to 70% of the mined supply from their holdings.\n\nOverall, the market appears to be in a period of quiet accumulation, which suggests an undercurrent of demand, despite the regulatory headwinds of late.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nAn Arduous Road Ahead\n\nIn an attempt to find a yardstick for what may lie on the road ahead, we can gauge previous market phases on the basis of duration. The chart below shows number of days spent in the following phases:\n\n🔵 Bull Market measured from cycle low until cycle peak.\n🔴 Bear Market measured from cycle peak to cycle low.\n⚫ Transition measured from cycle ATL until setting a new ATH.\n\nIf we assume the lows established in Nov 2022 hold, we can argue that the market has been within a transitional period for 221 days. Past transitional periods lasted between 459 days, and 770 days, suggesting that the patience of investors may be tested, on the order of 8 to 18-months, until a new market ATH, if history is any guide.\n\nLike Advanced Workbench\n\nThese transitional periods tend to see prices bounded between the Realized Price 🟠, and the Realized Price + 0.5 standard deviation band 🔵. Since setting each cycle low, the following proportion of trading days have been between these boundaries:\n\n2012-13 Cycle = 79%\n2015-17 Cycle = 64%\n2019-21 Cycle = 78%\n\nThis framework would suggest a price range between $20.1k (-23%) to the downside, and $45.0k (+71%) to the upside over this period.\n\nLike Advanced Workbench\n\nWith the Bitcoin halving just 305-days away, we can also see the relationship between these transitional periods and halving events, which tend to occur around two-thirds of the way through the journey.\n\nLike Advanced Workbench\n\nFrom this, we can index the price performance of prior epochs, starting at 305-days from the halving. The range of prior market performance on the date of the halving are as follows:\n\n🟠 Epoch 1 = +126% with a max drawdown of -44.8%\n🔴 Epoch 2 = +179% with a max drawdown of -23.3%\n🔵 Epoch 3 = -6.4%  with a max drawdown of -53% in March 2020\n\nThe first two Epochs both saw very positive price appreciation, whilst the third Epoch was far more challenging for investors to navigate, not least with the exogenous shock of March 2020.\n\nLike Advanced Workbench\n\nFinally, we conclude our analysis with an assessment of price performance over the year that follows each halving event.\n\n🔴 Epoch 2 Price Performance: +7358% with a max drawdown of -69.4%\n🔵 Epoch 3 Price Performance: +393% with a max drawdown of -29.6%\n🟢 Epoch 4 Price Performance: +366% with a max drawdown of -45.6%\n\nA diminishing returns effect is clearly noted across Epochs, a natural expectation as the market size, and capital flows grow in size over time.\n\nLike Advanced Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nAcross most measures of market energy, digital asset markets are displaying excitement in few of them. Volatility, volumes, and realized value are all at multi-year lows, as liquidity and excitement give way to investor apathy.\n\nHowever beneath the surface, the classic pattern of wealth transfer towards the price insensitive HODLer cohort remains uninterrupted. If past cycles are any guide, it it suggests that a period of apathetic sideways boredom may well define the road ahead, potentially lasting between 8 to 18-months in duration.",

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nUnder Pressure: The SEC Charges Binance and Coinbase\n\nThe US regulatory environment continues hostilities this week, with the SEC charging Binance and Coinbase for securities violations. In this edition, we assess the investor response from the lens of exchange inflows, and which investor cohorts panicked, and which stayed calm.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJun 12, 2023 • 7 min read\n\nIt has been yet another tumultuous week in the regulatory landscape for digital assets, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing back-to-back legal charges against the two largest exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. Both filed complaints pertain to the listing and trading tokens that the SEC deems to be unregistered securities, as well as claims that the offered earn and staking services are also in violation of securities laws. For Binance, the charges extend further, alleging that the entity engaged in wash trading, and has commingled customer funds between on-shore and off-shore entities.\n\nAs news of the Binance charges broke on 5-June, digital asset markets traded lower, with ETH down -5.4%, and BTC down -6.8%. Both assets recovered these losses as news of the Coinbase charges landed on 6-June. However, by the end of the week ETH had sold off further, down -8.2%, whilst BTC held up slightly better at -6.4%.\n\nGiven the gravity of the charges against the two largest exchanges, and an increasingly hostile US regulatory environment, we will focus on the investor response, with a specific lens on exchange activity. By inspecting the breakdown of exchange activity, we are seeking evidence that suggests any negative shifts in investor sentiment.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n🔔 Alert Ideas presented in this edition can be set within Glassnode Studio.\n\nLive Chart\nExchange Outflows\n\nImmediately after the Binance headlines broke, coins started to flow out of the exchange. The chart below displays the 2-week view of Binance's exchange reserves for the major assets; BTC, ETH, and stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD).\n\nOver the last 7-days, investors have withdrawn their assets at a steady pace, with aggregate stablecoin balances down over $1.6B, equivalent to 20.9% of the total Binance balance. BTC and ETH reserves are down a more modest 5.7% and 7.1%, respectively.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWhilst net outflows have occurred at Binance, we must keep in mind that the exchange still holds some of the largest reserves of any entity on-chain, and their BTC and ETH balances are still quite substantial.\n\nBinance stablecoin reserves display the largest decline of note, having fallen precipetously from over $26.0B in November 2022, to just $6.5B today (a 75% decline). This is driven in part by prior SEC complaints against BUSD, causing issuer Paxos to enter redemption-only mode (WoC 14).\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nFor Coinbase, net reserve changes are far less dramatic, with stablecoin balances remaining flat on the week, and BTC balances declining by just 2,300 BTC (0.5% of total).\n\nEther balances however did see a very large 291k ETH decline, equivalent to around 8.0% of the total balance. This suggests a more pronounced investor response, perhaps related to the offered staking services coming under fire.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nBreakdown of Exchange Deposits by Cohort\n\nAnalysing the breakdown of exchange withdrawals by USD size shows an interesting divergence in investor behavior this week:\n\nTransactions below $10M in size have seen consistent withdrawals, with a net outflow of over $130M/day maintained all week.\nTransactions above $10M in size have seen consistent deposits, with inflow rates ranging between $15M and $30M/day.\n\nThis suggests that very large entities (such as institutions) are more affected to a greater extent by the SEC news as compared to smaller entities. It remains to be seen if this becomes a more sustained trend over coming weeks.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: For more insights into flows in and out of exchanges, visit our Exchange dashboards for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Stablecoins.\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThe chart below overlays BTC exchange deposit and withdrawal volumes, demonstrating how flows in both directions tend to track each other very closely. This week was no exception, with flows in, and out increasing by around 70% to $845M/day.\n\nWithdrawals on aggregate have outpaced deposits by around 10% this week, suggesting that self-custody remains a preferred strategy for investors overall. A similar dynamic was observed around the last major exchange related news, being the collapse of FTX (WoC 46-2022).\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nFocusing on aggregate deposit volumes, we can establish a breakdown by cohort type. We can thus identify which investor groups have reacted most significantly to the news:\n\n🔴 Short-Term Holders account for 76.4% of deposit volume (23.0k BTC)\n🔵 Long-Term Holders account for just 1.9% of deposit volume (570 BTC)\n🟢 Inter-Exchange Transfers account for 21.7% of deposit volume (6.53k BTC)\n\nSTHs historically account for a stable ~60% of deposit flows, which suggests recent buyers have been the most active this week. Inter-exchange flows are typically around 35%, suggesting that investors on the margin are preferring to take self-custody, rather than simply transferring coins to a different exchange.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThe chart below confirms the first observation, with the STH cohort sending 0.93% of their total held balance into exchanges this week. Whilst not yet above the 1% threshold we often see associated with high volatility events, it is a notable uptick relative to 2021-22 cycle baseline.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: We recently launched a new Professional Cohorts and Exchanges focused on Long and Short-Term Holder flows into exchanges.\nLive Professional Chart\n\nBitcoin Long-Term Holders on the other hand are remarkably calm, displaying no discernible reaction to the news. Their exchange inflow volume this week was just 0.004% of their total holdings, with 66% of all trading days seeing a larger relative inflows.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nRealized Apathy\n\nWhilst the charts above point to a subset of recent buyers sending coins into exchanges this week, the deeper picture is even more intriguing. The chart below shows the total Realized Profit, or Loss locked in by exchange deposits, and what we can see is that both sides are relatively small.\n\nOf all the coins flowing into of exchanges, very few of them are locking in any appreciable profit, or loss. In other words, most coins sent to exchanges, were acquired at a price very close to the current spot rate, and likely acquired recently given the dominance of Short-Term Holders.\n\nThis speaks to a degree of both confidence (investors are unshaken by the news in aggregate), but also apathy (the current price range isn't sufficient incentive to spend).\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: Our Professional dashboard for Entity-Adjusted Realized Profit and Loss provides our most advanced data on the topic.\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWith such extreme lows in realized profit or loss, the sell-side risk ratio has fallen towards all-time-lows. This metric compares the aggregate profit/loss locked in by the market relative to the asset size (the Realized Cap).\n\nThe total value of profit and loss being locked in is extremely small relative to the current Bitcoin Realized Cap of $391B. Low values of the Sell-side Risk Ratio has historically occurred during periods of heightened investor apathy, typically on the back-side of deep bearish trends.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboards: The Sell-side Risk Ratio is available in the Realized Profit/Loss dashboard (for Advanced), and Entity-Adjusted (for Professionals).\nLive Professional Chart — (Advanced Variant)\n\nWe can see that aggregate transfer volume is also trading at cyclical lows. This week did not see any appreciable uptick on overall transfer volume, remaining at around $2.85B/day.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nSimilar to the Sell-side Risk Ratio, we can also compare the amount of realized profit and loss to this transfer volume via the Realized RVT Ratio. This metric is also in a strong downtrend, which is typical of bearish trends, as apathy, and boredom take hold.\n\nDuration and time-pain on the back-side of a bear market is a characteristic of many assets and markets, and here we can visualize this playing out across both of these metrics.\n\nLive Professional Chart — (Advanced Variant)\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe regulatory environment in the US remains hostile, with the SEC filing very significant charges against the two largest exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. The balances of major assets on these two exchanges have declined this week, as a portion of customers withdraw out of concern. With the exception of stablecoins at Binance, the declines are well within typical patterns, and it remains to be seen how investors react as both lawsuits play out.\n\nIn the immediate term, it appears that many recent BTC buyers (STHs) have sent their coins into exchanges, likely for sale, to de-risk their position. More broadly however, the remarkably low realized profit and loss that was locked in, and almost non-existent reaction by Long-Term Holders suggests that many investors were hardly surprised by the news.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "Ethereum and DeFi\nRisk-Off Capital Rotation\n\nWhile digital asset prices have remained stagnant in recent months, several indicators point towards a risk-off rotation of capital taking place beneath the surface. Volumes have dried up, and investors are increasingly expressing a preference for stablecoin capital.\n\nGlassnode, Alice Kohn\nJun 5, 2023 • 8 min read\n\nThe quiet and calm persists in digital asset markets, with the price of ETH remaining confined to a $68 range this week (3.6%), trading between a low of $1,861 and a high of $1,931. Aside from a small surge in ETH markets following the Shanghai upgrade, ETH prices have been more or less flat since mid March.\n\nAs the market grinds sideways, there are growing divergences in market preference occurring beneath the surface, many hinting at a risk-off environment. Trade volumes remain depressed, DeFi usage has becoming increasingly automated, and a market preference is growing for stablecoins, specifically for Tether (USDT).\n\nIn this edition, we will explore these developing undercurrents, and how we can observe them through on- and off-chain data.\n\nAutomated Arbitrage\n\nWhilst ETH prices have remained relatively flat and range-bound since March, gas prices did experience a non-trivial uptick in the month of May. Gas prices increased to an average gas price of 76 Gwei, equating to $1.14 for a regular ETH transfer transaction. Mean gas price reached over 155 Gwei in early May ($6.53 per ETH transfer), which is almost as high as during the 2021-22 bull cycle.\n\nLive Chart\n\nSmart contract interactions are more gas intensive and can cost multiples of a simple transfer. Gas usage associated with DeFi protocols rose 270% in late April, pushing daily gas consumption by the sector above 20B gas units.\n\nLive Advances Chart\n\nIf we break down DeFi gas by protocol, we quickly determine that the primary uplift in activity is driven by trading activity on decentralized exchanges. Uniswap remains the primary venue, seeing a 388% increase in gas usage since April, and now accounts for between 7.7% and 14.4% of total Ethereum gas demand.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThose who follow the news might assume that this increase in activity is due to the recent Memecoin hype, which revolved around tokens such as PEPE and HEX. However, a more detailed analysis of trading volume on Uniswap paints a more detailed picture.\n\nThe chart below shows the top traded pools on Uniswap, revealing that the highest volumes over the past 30 days were primarily related to larger market cap assets like ETH, stablecoins, WBTC and the Coinbase's staking derivative cbETH.\n\nAfter comparing the addresses of the top 10 traders with our labels, we found that all but one were associated with MEV bots. With the infamous MEV-bot jaredfromsubway.eth making over USD 3B in trading volume during the past month.\n\nWhilst it requires further research to determine how many of the global pool of traders are bots, the volume size generated by the top ten already gives us an idea of how much of Uniswap's volume may in fact be automated arbitrage.\n\nOne way to rationalize this is to consider the exponential scope of arbitrage opportunities available across Ethereum DEXs:\n\nAs the price of each token (+ slippage) changes, eventually the gas fee will justify an arbitrage transaction.\nEach DEX pool hosting that token provides a venue for an arbitrage transaction.\nThus, the number of potential arbitrage transaction opportunities will grow exponentially, related to both the number of DEX liquidity pools, and the number of tokens available to trade.\n\nIf we take into account that many bots engage in arbitrage or sandwich attacks, the degree of 'organic' trading volume on Uniswap may well account for over two-thirds of all DEX activity.\n\n\nWhile the activities of these trading bots may be considered harmful for end-users of Ethereum, it does have benefits for Ethereum validators. In the past month, validators not only earned higher rewards due to increased priority fees, but also benefited from MEV-boost payments. These payments are collected from traders and bots who pay to have their transactions ordered in the most profitable way within a block.\n\nIn many ways, this highlights an increasingly favourable trend for staked ETH as a primary asset within the Ethereum ecosystem. This also establishes a native hurdle rate which tokens must compete with in order to attract capital flows.\n\n💡\nRelated Analysis: We covered this divergence between ETH and DeFi token performance in our latest report; Dealing with the DeFi Downtrend.\nSource: MEVboost.pics\nRisk-Off Rotation\n\nThere are also strong indications of capital rotation moving lower on the risk curve, shifting towards stablecoins and BTC as liquidity lightens. If we start with Ethereum Futures markets, we can obtain a view into market participants beyond the crypto-native traders usually found on decentralized exchanges.\n\nAfter the FTX collapse, futures trade volume collapsed to just ~$7.5B/day. Volumes have seen a comeback in 2023, however the 30-day average ($12.0B/day) remains well below the yearly average ($21.5B/day).\n\nUnlike the uptick in Uniswap trading activity, futures trading has continued to contract through May, indicating that institutional trading interest and liquidity remains quite weak.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can see a supporting trend in the relative volume dominance between BTC and ETH in perpetual swap markets. Whilst trade volume between both assets reached parity in late 2022, Ethereum's relative share of futures volume has decreased massively in 2023.\n\nETH currently represents 34.5% of trade volume between the two majors, suggesting liquidity is moving down the risk curve, and preferring to concentrate in BTC markets on a relative basis.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nOn-chain data provides another view into capital flows and rotation within crypto markets. The chart below compares the total USD denominated value of ETH vs stablecoins flowing in and out of exchanges. During the massive  deleveraging in 2022, a noticeable shift in investor preference developed, with ETH dominance in capital flows declining from ~35% to 10%.\n\nIn 2023, we observed a strong reversal, with ETH's proportion of exchange flows rising back to 25%. However, this trend stalled in early May, suggesting a potential change in risk appetite. Investors who benefited from the strong first quarter returns, may be starting to transition capital back towards stablecoins.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: For more insights into capital flows into and within the crypto markets, refer to our Capital Rotation Dashboard.\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nAnother way to firm up this conclusion is by comparing the daily exchange inflows of each asset as a measure of buy-side and sell-side pressure. For this simplified model, we assume that BTC+ETH exchange inflows represent sell-side pressure, whilst and Stablecoin inflows represent buy-side pressure.\n\nNegative values suggest that we have seen a net sell-side regime since the beginning of April 2023, where inflows of BTC+ETH started to exceed those of stablecoins. This is a distinct break from the significant buy-side pressure seen in Q1, with buy-side weakening in early April, which coincided with the start of the prevailing market correction.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nGenerally speaking, capital tends to flow into digital assets through the two majors, BTC and ETH, or via stablecoins. Therefore, we can estimate the direction of aggregate capital flows by aggregating and comparing two metrics:\n\nRealized Cap for BTC and ETH (being the net change in value for coins moved on-chain)\nCirculating supply for stablecoins (considering USDT, USDC, BUSD, TUSD, and DAI)\n\nFrom this, we can see that capital flows into the crypto markets has been primarily driven by an uptick in capital flows into BTC (+$4.47B/mth), followed by ETH (+$3.5B/mth). However this has been offset in part by around -$1.2B in capital outflows from stablecoins, as significant redemptions take place within the stablecoin sector.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nRecent stablecoins capital outflows are driven primarily by the second (USDC), and third (BUSD) largest assets, seeing supplies fall in 2023 by -$15.7B and $-11.5B, respectively. USDT has absorbed a significant proportion of these flows, pushing to a new ATH supply of $83.1B.\n\nIt is likely that this reflects a geographical divergence, with US regulated entities historically having expressed a preference for USDC over USDT.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe will close out by noting that a similar divergence is visible in the year-over-year BTC supply change based on geographical regions. The extreme dominance of US entities in 2020-21 has clearly reversed, with US supply dominance falling by 11% since mid-2022. European markets have been fairly neutral over the last year, whilst a significant increase in supply dominance is visible across Asian trading hours.\n\n📊\nRelated Dashboard: A dashboard comparing regional price and supply change for US, EU, and Asia trading hours is available for our Professional members.\nLive Professional Dashboard\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nOver the past month, there has been increased activity on decentralized exchanges, particularly on Uniswap. Although one may think Memecoins had sparked this activities, a closer look reveals most of the volume was generated on larger and deeper WETH-Stablecoin pools. Remarkably, only a fraction of this trading actvities seems to have been organic, suggesting it is primarily arbitrage, MEV, and algorithmic trading.\n\nGiven US interest rates are now over 5%, non-interest-bearing stablecoins have become less attractive, especially to investors with access to US capital markets. Tether on the other hand has historically found wider adoption in markets outside the US, where national currencies are often weaker, and access to USD less common. Similarly, as an increasingly hostile regulatory environment is established in the US, capital appears to be flowing out, and eastward in the digital asset sector.\n\nMuch of this hints to a generally risk-off environment, with the remaining capital concentrating in the more liquid majors, and a growing preference for stablecoin capital.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nSeeking Equilibrium\n\nWith prices tight, and the volatility spring coiled, the Bitcoin market looks increasingly ready to move out of the current equilibrium. As Long-Term Holder spending ticks marginally higher, we present a series of on-chain tools to help navigate the volatile road ahead.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nMay 29, 2023 • 8 min read\n\nSince October 2022, global market liquidity has seen an uptick, with digital assets, and precious metal prices responding positively, and in an increasingly coupled manner. Both asset classes are currently experiencing their second uptrend correction of the year, with BTC and Silver down -10.8% and -10.6%, from their respective 90-day highs. Gold is holding up best, posting a -5.4% drawdown so far, whilst WTI Crude Oil prices continue to struggle, trading range-bound and down -12.1% since the April high.\n\nLive Standard Workbench\n\nOver the last 90-days, Crude Oil (WTI) declined -4.0%, whilst Gold (XAU) and Silver (XAG) have rallied 7.5% and 12.7%, respectively. Bitcoin however, continues to outperform, remaining 14.5% above the February close. BTC performance is weaker than the peak first quarter performance of 72%, but remains the strongest performer amongst these major commodities.\n\nLive Standard Workbench\n\nAs we covered last week, the market appears to be gearing up for a regime of higher volatility. In this weeks report, we will seek to bound the problem, and assess the upper and lower psychological levels, where renewed investor participation is likely to come into play.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n🔔 Alert Ideas presented in this edition can be set within Glassnode Studio.\n\nDiminishing Momentum\n\nAs momentum slows down in the Bitcoin market, the Monthly Realized Volatility has dropped to 34.1%, which is below the 1-standard deviation Bollinger Band. Historically, such low-volatility regimes only account for 19.3% of market history, and therefore expectations of elevated volatility on the near-term horizon is a logical conclusion.\n\n🗜️ Workbench Tip: This chart is constructed using the standard deviation function std(m2, 365) to calculate Bollinger style bands for Realized Volatility.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nTransfer volumes on-chain remain cyclically low (WoC 21), which translates into a decline in activity associated with exchanges. To quantify this concept, we can compare the average number of exchange deposit/withdrawal transactions happening this week, to the 6-month median, producing an activity ratio.\n\nWe can see the cyclical trend of exchange activity for All Exchanges 🟦, and note that recent activity has dropped -27.3% relative to the last six months. To account for FTX, which completely ceased operations in Nov 2022, we can see a similar activity momentum for Binance only 🟨, suggesting investor activity is indeed exceptionally light.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nMapping Out An Equilibrium\n\nThe lower volatility, and declining on-chain activity all point towards a sort of equilibrium phase. We will now leverage the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric to verify this hypothesis.\n\nThis indicator examines the dollar value of the total net profit or loss as a percentage of the market cap. From a macro perspective, we can define four phases in a cycle:\n\nBottom Discovery 🔴: NUPL < 0\nCapitulation and Recovery 🟠: 0 < NUPL < 0.25\nEquilibrium Phase 🟡: 0.25 < NUPL < 0.5\nBull Market Euphoria 🟢: 0.5 < NUPL\n\nThe current NUPL value of 0.29 is at the lower bound of the equilibrium phase, which is a zone where 37.5% of all Bitcoin trading days have been. This zone was reached in early March 2023, and persisted for around 16 months in the last two cycles.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: NUPL (7-day SMA) breaking below 0.25 would indicate that market profitability has declined back into the Capitulation and Recovery phase, and may suggest weakness.\nLive Advanced Chart\nPsychological Ranges\n\nWe can also utilize a set of investor cost basis to bound the likely boundaries of near-term volatility. The goal is to find price levels which are likely to elicit a significant psychological response from a larger proportion of holders.\n\nThe Active Investor Cost Basis 🔵 is currently trading at $33.5k, which accounts only for investors actively participating in the market, and provides a near-term upper bound price model. With the Active Investor MVRV at 0.83, it suggests that many 2021-22 cycle buyers are still underwater, and may be waiting for break-even prices to liquidate their holdings.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Price breaking above $33.5k would indicate that the average investor from the 2021-22 cycle is now back in profit, and reflects a psychological area of interest.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nA lower bound pricing model can also be identified, seeking an approximate macro support in the case of a significant market deterioration, such as the COVID Crash March of 2020. The Investor Cap Price model is calculated as the difference between the Realized Cap and the Thermocap, reflecting a floor model based on investor holdings, excluding miners.\n\nWe can see that the Investor Price model was briefly intersected during the March 2020 sell-off, and is currently trading at $17.65k. With Investor Capital MVRV currently at 1.58, it falls within a very similar equilibrium range to the 2019-20 mini-market cycle.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe market seems to have little gravity pulling it in either direction at present. We can also see that prices have returned to the Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis, and reset several unrealized profit/loss metrics.\n\nThe STH Unrealized Profit / Loss Ratio (introduced in WoC 18) has cooled off significantly, returning to a break-even level of 1.0 and then bouncing back to 2.6. This indicates a balanced position of profit and loss for new investors. Falling below this level tends to precede a more extensive price contraction, however, the market tends to find support at this level during resilient bull runs.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nThe Road Higher\n\nHaving established that the market is in equilibrium, we can use on-chain tools to provide a macro roadmap of this phase from prior cycles.\n\nThe first tool tracks the Supply side of Long-Term Holders (LTH). We can see that Long-Term Supply tends to be quite cyclical, and we have highlighted various regimes of strong spending 🔴, and strong holding 🟢 patterns on the chart below.\n\nBefore reclaiming the ATH, the Long-term holder supply goes through a lengthy re-accumulation period, with a generally flat, to a modest rise in aggregate supply held.\nAs the market breaks the previous cycle ATH, the incentive to ramp up spending increases significantly. This results in a dramatic decline in LTH supply, transferring coins to newer buyers, at expensive prices.\n\nThroughout the 2022 bear market, the first phase LTH supply pattern has played out exactly, showing the remarkable resilience of BTC holders amidst extreme volatility.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWe can use these observations to build a tool that gauges market sentiment. First, we will break the long and rocky road between bear market lows, and the last cycle ATH into three sub-intervals:\n\nBottom Discovery 🟥: Price below Long-Term Holders Cost Basis.\nEquilibrium 🟧:  Price is above Long-Term Holders Cost Basis. but below the previous ATH.\nPrice Discovery 🟩:  Price is above the last cycle ATH.\n\nNext, we overlay market performance with the intensity of LTH spending (usually associated with either profit-taking, or capitulation). Here, we display LTH spending via the Spending Binary Indicator (SBI), which simply tracks whether LTH spending is of an intensity sufficient to decrease the total LTH Supply, averaged over the last 7-days.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nFrom this, we can see that LTH spending was been extremely light over recent weeks, but has ticked higher during this correction. The Indicator reached a level suggesting 4-of-7 days experienced a net divestment by LTHs, which is a level similar to exit liquidity events seen YTD.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nTo wrap up, we can merge these two indicators to construct a new tool for breaking up market sentiment into four sub-categories, and spotting periods of elevated LTH divestment:\n\nCapitulation 🟥: Spot price is lower than the LTH cost basis and therefore any strong spending  is likely due to financial pressure and capitulation (Conditions: LTH-MVRV < 1 and SBI > 0.55).\nTransition 🟧: Market is trading slightly above the long-term holders cost basis, and occasional light spending is part of day-to-day trade (Conditions: 1.0 < LTH-MVRV < 1.5  and SBI > 0.55).\nEquilibrium 🟨: After recovering from a prolonged bear, the market seeks a new balance between minimal in-flowing demand, lighter liquidity, and underwater holders from the previous cycle. Strong LTH spending during this stage is usually associated with sudden rallies or corrections (Conditions: 1.5 < LTH-MVRV < 3.5 and SBI > 0.55).\nEuphoria 🟩: As LTH-MVRV reaches 3.5 (historically aligned with the market hitting the prior ATH), LTHs are holding upwards of 250% profit on average. The market enters a euphoria phase, which motivates these investors to spend at very high, and accelerating rates (Conditions:  LTH-MVRV > 3.5 and SBI = 1.00).\n\nOur current market has recently reached the Transition phase, flagging a local uptick in LTH spending this week. Depending on what direction volatility erupts next, we can employ this tool to locate local periods of overheated conditions, as observed from the lens of Long-Term Holders.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe digital asset market continues to outperform major commodities in 2023, however all are currently experiencing a meaningful correction. Having recovered from the depths of the 2022 bear market, Bitcoin investors find themselves in a form of equilibrium, with little gravity in either direction.\n\nGiven the extremely low volatility, and narrow trading ranges of late, it seems this equilibrium is soon to be disturbed. In response, we have seen a modest uptick in Long-Term Holder spending, and developed a suite of price levels, and behavior patterns to monitor as the situation unfolds.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nQuiet But Confident\n\nThe Bitcoin market has traded within an extremely tight price range this week, whilst on-chain volumes have been extremely light, hovering around cyclical lows. Meanwhile, large swathes of the coin supply remain dormant in investor wallets with supply in several key age bands hitting all-time-highs.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nMay 22, 2023 • 7 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has consolidated this week, trading within a relatively narrow 3.4% price range, with a low of $26.6k and high of $27.5k. In fact, this has been one of the tightest trading ranges over the last few years, with the last examples being the 2023 yearly open, and July 2020 after the recovery from the COVID sell-off.\n\nThis comes alongside extremely light on-chain volume, with aggregate, entity-adjusted, and exchange related flows remaining at cyclical lows. Meanwhile, large swathes of the coin supply remain dormant in investor wallets, with several key age bands hitting all-time-highs.\n\nIn this edition, we will explore this interesting state of play, and what it tells us about investor confidence, incentives, and perspective on the 2023 market.\n\n💡\nWorkbench Tip: This chart is constructed utilizing the cummax(m1,7) function to establish rolling 7-day upper and lower price range bands.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nLive Workbench\nVolume Down\n\nIn last weeks edition, we shows how on-chain activity for Bitcoin has reached historical highs for metrics such as Transaction counts, largely related to ordinals, inscriptions, and BRC-20 tokens. These types of transactions tend to represent relatively small BTC volumes however, with ordinals often transferred alongside a small volume of BTC (usually around 10k sats = 0.0001 BTC).\n\nAssessing the Transfer Volume settled by the Bitcoin network across the last three years, we note a large decline in overall economical throughput since early 2021, falling from a cycle high of $13.1B to a cycle low of $1.9B, a 85.5% decline. Transfer volumes have experienced a marginal uplift in 2023, however remain near cycle lows between $1.9B and $4.4B.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nExchanges remain a centerpiece for BTC trade, and studying the flows in and out provides a robust proxy for trade volume, awareness, speculation demand, and investor confidence. We see a similar structural decline in exchange deposit volume, declining from a peak of $4.2B in May 2021 to a low of $343.4M today (-91.8%).\n\n⚠️\nAlert Idea: Exchange Inflow Volume (7D-SMA) rising above $750M/day may suggest a significant uptick in trade activity is underway, suggesting elevated volatility on the horizon.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAnother useful proxy for assessing network utilization is the absolute value of Realized Profit and Loss events. This provides insight into the capital flows in or out of the asset, as coins are revalued higher, or lower. The combined Realized Profit and Loss is trading around the lowest levels seen over the last 3 years.\n\nThis suggests that the majority of holders with large profits, or losses, are unwilling to spend.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nUnrealized Potential\n\nWe have established that both the nominal and realized network throughput remains cyclically low. This may be due to many market participants having a cost basis which is quite close to the current price, thus indicating there is minimal incentive to spend just yet. Participants may require greater volatility, in in either direction, to entice spending behavior.\n\nThe Adjusted Realized Price provides an improved model for estimating this market wide cost-basis. It works by removing the tremendous unrealized profits held by long-dormant (and likely lost) coins (> 7y), isolating the economically active and more price sensitive cohort of holders.\n\nSpot prices are currently trading just above the Adjusted Realized Price ($25.2k), which is likely a psychological area of interest in the event of a pullback. This also firms up the thesis that there is simply not a great deal of profit (or loss) available to be taken by the active participants in the market.\n\n⚠️\nAlert Idea: Price breaking below $25.2k would indicate a retest of the cost basis for the economically active supply is underway, being a key psychological price level to watch.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe recent rally above $30k saw the Adjusted MVRV Ratio rise to a value of 1.21, suggesting a fairly modest 21% unrealized profit level was reached.\n\nCurrently, the aMVRV is recording a value of 1.09, suggesting just 9% unrealized profit remains within in the market. This is coincident with what were historically oversold levels in both the 2018, 2019 and March 2020 cycle lows.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nSupply Stays Still\n\nDespite the blistering start to the year across the digital asset landscape, the BTC supply held for longer than 1yr+ continues to push to new highs. The chart below shows four subsets of this dormant supply as a proportion of the total circulating supply:\n\n🔴 Supply Last Active 1+ Yrs Ago: 68.1%\n🟡 Supply Last Active 2+ Yrs Ago: 55.2%\n🟢 Supply Last Active 3+ Yrs Ago: 40.0%\n🔵 Supply Last Active 5+ Yrs Ago: 28.9%\n\nThe remarkable level of HODLing across the supply continues, with such high coin inactivity supporting the extreme lows of on-chain volume throughput.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThis phenomena is also reflected across Long-Term Holder Supply (coins held > 155-days), which is at a new ATH of 14.46M BTC. This reflects coins acquired immediately after the FTX failure maturing into LTH status.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nConfluence can be found in the Liveliness metric, which compares the relative balance between HODLing and spending behavior. Currently, network Liveliness is descending to the lowest value recorded since the Dec 2020 breakout above $20K. Persistent downtrends in Liveliness reaffirm that HODLing is certainly the current primary market dynamic across the majority of supply.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIf we look to the Short-Term Holder (STH) cohort, we can assess the amount of ‘holding time’ being spent by this group (measured as coinday destruction over the last 90-days). By this metric, STH coinday destruction is extremely low, and significantly below the two large panic capitulation events occurring in June, and November 2022.\n\nThis infers that STHs are generally reluctant to spend within the current price range, and require greater volatility, and likely higher prices (realizing profits) as an incentive.\n\nOverall, these metrics paint a relatively constructive view of Bitcoin holder conviction, where most are simply not interested in spending their coins just yet.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nHolders From Last Cycle Are Forged\n\nFollowing the November low, the USD denominated wealth held within coins aged 2y-3y has expanded from 3.1% to 27.7%, as large swathes of supply mature across the 2yr boundary. This reflects supply that was acquired after the May 2021 sell-off from $56k to $29k.\n\nThe chart below shows the changing proportion of USD wealth held in these age bands:\n\n🟢 Wealth Held by 2y-3y: 3.1% to 27.7% (up +24.6%)\n🟡 Wealth Held by 1y-2y: 43.5% to 28.3 (down -15.2%)\n🟠 Wealth Held by 6m-1y: 25.5% to 10.6% (down -14.9%)\n\nWe can also utilize a new variant of the RHODL Ratio, comparing the wealth held in 2y+, to those in the 6m-2y age band. This helps us evaluate the balance between experienced (2yr+) and single cycle Long-Term Holders (6m-2y).\n\nCurrently, this RHODL variant is climbing exponentially, suggesting a significant portion of holders from the 2021-22 cycle are maturing into the experienced HODLers. Given the extraordinary, and mostly downside volatility experienced over this period, it demonstrates that the Bitcoin holder base remains incredibly resolute, which is a noteworthy, and likely constructive observation.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nOne of the great assets of on-chain analysis is our ability to observe both sides of holder behavior; their willingness to hold, and their willingness to spend. What we continue to observe is that the conviction of existing Bitcoin holders remains remarkably high, despite the extreme the volatility and immense deleveraging over the last 2yrs.\n\nIt is important to highlight that volume throughput is very low right now, indicating an arguably lackluster inflow of new demand, as well as growing dominance by low volume ordinal/inscription transactions. However, this is matched by an existing holder base who can be argued are increasingly price insensitive.\n\nGiven 2022 provided no shortage of reasons to panic, capitulate, and otherwise exit the market, the ageing of coins into multi-year age bands is noteworthy. It suggests a case where those who survived 2022, may require higher prices before opening up their cold storage wallets.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Bitcoin Blockspace Boom\n\nBitcoin blockspace experienced a historically significant inflow of demand last week, as speculators rushed to mint BRC-20 tokens via text inscriptions. This resulted in immense fee pressure, driving miner fee revenue towards ATHs, and surpassing the 6.25 BTC block subsidy for the fifth time.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nMay 15, 2023 • 7 min read\n\nThis week saw an explosion in demand for Bitcoin blockspace, as speculative interest in minting tokens, issued via text file inscriptions, pushed fees through the roof.\n\nTransaction counts for Bitcoin reached new all-time-highs, and the average fee paid per block to miners surpassed the block subsidy of 6.25 BTC. Whilst it remains to be seen whether these BRC-20 tokens gain long-term traction, the brief bump in mining revenue was surely a welcome reprieve for miners after the savage bear market of 2022.\n\nIn this edition, we will explore the impact that demand for BRC-20 tokens have had for Bitcoin on-chain activity, inscription types, and miner revenues.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\n📽️ Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, or visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nA New Demand For Bitcoin Blockspace?\n\nThis week, the Bitcoin network experienced a historically large inflow of demand for blockspace with the emergence of BRC-20 tokens. The shorthand summary of BRC-20 is that it is a proposed mechanism for issuing tokens on the Bitcoin ledger. The system leverages ordinal theory (see our report), and is enacted by inscribing JSON text files into the blockchain.\n\nGiven the small data footprint of text inscriptions, and large the fees BRC-20 users were willing to pay, miners were able to fill blocks with a record number of transactions. A new ATH daily transaction count of 682k was reached this week, eclipsing the 2017 peak by an incredible 39%.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe average number of transactions per block more than doubled, increasing from the typical baseline of around 2k transactions per block, to over 4.3k per block. Since Bitcoin has a blocksize limit, such a significant increase in transaction counts is a direct result of inscriptions utilizing the 75% discount applied to witness data, thus allowing a denser consumption of available block capacity.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nInterestingly, whilst transaction activity was booming, the number of active addresses fell to cycle lows of 566k addresses per day. This is a curious scenario, whereby many BRC-20 users appear to have re-used their Bitcoin addresses, perhaps due to having more familiarity with the way account based chains like Ethereum or Solana operate, and less so with the Bitcoin UTXO system.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTsypruyan first identified this behavior, noting that 71% of transaction outputs were re-using addresses, an uptick from the ~50% baseline (which is largely associated with exchange wallet management).\n\nText Takes Over\n\nSince BRC-20 inscriptions are just small JSON text files, and take advantage of the 75% SegWit discount on witness data, their on-chain data footprint is relatively small. As a result, the average transaction size (in bytes) collapsed to 405 bytes, which is almost an all-time-low.\n\nThis is a full reversal from the first wave of primarily image based inscriptions seen in Q1, which reached new all-time-highs of ~1.5 kilobytes per transaction.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe explosion of text based inscriptions has left the first wave of images and files in the dust. In several instances throughout May, more than 350k text inscriptions were encoded to the chain in a single day, sustaining levels well above 250k/day over the last week.\n\nLive Professional Dashboard\n\nOut of the pool of total confirmed transactions, text based inscriptions accounted for over 50% of them. This is significantly higher than the 5% to 20% dominance seen with image inscriptions in the first wave, demonstrating the scale of this wave of demand.\n\nLive Professional Dashboard\n\nAs a result, the total number of text inscriptions to date has firmly eclipsed those of images, surpassing by 5-million in number. There is now almost a full order of magnitude more text based vs image based inscriptions, having reached a total of 5.69-million text files written to the Bitcoin blockchain (accounting for 89% of the total so far).\n\nNote, the y-axis of the chart below is in log-scale.\n\nLive Professional Dashboard\nMiners Are Paid a Brief Bonus\n\nThe extreme urgency of BRC-20 transactors is captured the the extraordinary fees they paid for the experience. As congestion in our Bitcoin mempool reached fever pitch, fee pressure rose dramatically.\n\nFor only the fifth time in history, the average fee paid per block surpassed the block subsidy, with the last instance being at the 2017 market peak. For all five of these events, the period of high fee pressure was short-lived, and subsided after just a few days.\n\nAt the height of the BRC-20 mania, the average mined block was paying 6.66 BTC in fees, making for a total reward of 12.9 BTC per block (~$348k).\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nText files during this second wave accounted for between 30% and 60% of total fees paid, which is significantly higher than the 5% to 20% typically seen during the first wave if image inscriptions.\n\nLive Professional Dashboard\n\nIn total, inscriptions have paid a cumulative sum of 1,262 BTC in fees to miners, with 1,090 BTC (86%) of this occurring during the last week. The chart below shows just how explosive the fee pressure associated with text files has been.\n\nLive Professional Dashboard\n\nWith this rapid rise in demand for Bitcoin blockspace, the total USD denominated fees paid per day almost set a new all-time-high, peaking at $17.8M/day. A challenging side effect of this was that the cost of sending a regular Bitcoin transaction also reached extreme heights, with the median and mean fee required to get a transaction included in a block hitting $20.17 and $30.80, respectively.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nOver the last month the spot price of BTC has traded between $26k and $30k. Over this same period, miners have earned $773M in revenue from the 6.25 BTC block subsidy. With this recent bump in fee pressure, miners have earned an additional $100M in aggregate revenue.\n\nAs a result, the proportion of miner revenue associated with fees reached 11.5%, which is coincident with the elevated levels seen in both the 2017, and 2021 bull market periods.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe acceleration of fee pressure is also historically significant. The chart below presents a series of Z-Scores for miner fee revenue, with training windows ranging from 1-year, to 4-years. The aim is to identify periods where fee pressure has risen in a statistically significant way across a wide range of market conditions.\n\nOn the shorter 1y-2y windows, the acceleration of fee pressure is arguably the fastest in history, comparable only to the 2011 era when Bitcoin barely had a year of price history. On the longer-term 3y-4y windows, fee pressure rose faster and larger than the 2021 bull market, and is best compared to the 2013 and 2017 bull markets.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe USD revenue earner per Exahash, often called the hash-price, is the ideal tool for assessing the impact to miner revenues. It accounts not only for the BTC spot price, and fee pressure, but also for the estimated hashrate that is competing to earn the reward.\n\nHash-price briefly ticked up to $172.2k/EH this week, however has since collapsed by 55%, back to $76.3k/EH as fee pressure subsided. Whilst this burst of blockspace demand provided a positive uptick in miner revenues, it is short-lived thus far, and pales in comparison to the relentless downtrend (in log-scale) of hash-price.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nOut of the 3,275 BTC in total fees paid to miners over the last 2-weeks, the aggregate miner balance has only increased by 655 BTC, approximately 20% of the fees paid. The blue trace below shows the proportion of newly mined BTC that miners are spending, and it continues to oscillate around 100%.\n\nOverall, whilst miners no doubt enjoyed the revenue uptick, it appears the majority of it was distributed, likely providing relief after the brutal downtrend that was the 2022 bear market.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe emergence of Ordinals, Inscriptions, and now BRC-20 tokens continues to be one of the more unexpected developments in Bitcoin, sparking healthy debate about the technical, practical, and philosophical merits. What is known, is that so far, these technologies have given rise to a new buyer for Bitcoin blockspace, both at the lower, and now upper bounds of fee rates paid.\n\nThis week saw aggregate fees paid surpass the block reward for only the fifth time in history. The event pushed USD denominated fee revenue almost to new ATHs of $17.8M/day, and provided miners with a sorely needed revenue boost after 2022.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens have staying power long-term, however it does give us a new lens through which to observe demand for the settlement assurances of Bitcoin.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

In this edition, we will examine what actually happened to the 1.55M withdrawn ETH, and how stake has reshuffled between stakers, staking service providers, and sell-side pressure.\n\nGlassnode, Alice Kohn\nMay 8, 2023 • 8 min read\n\nOn 12th April 2023, the Ethereum network underwent a major upgrade with the Shanghai/Capella hardfork, which enabled the withdrawal of ETH funds staked for the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. After more than two years, stakers are finally able to receive accumulated rewards, exit their staked positions, or initiate changes to their staking setup.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the Ethereum market did not appear shaken by these fund becoming liquid after the upgrade. Instead, prices climbed to $2,110 in the week afterwards, before reverting back to $1,920, likely driven by the general decline across the digital asset market.\n\nIn this week's edition, we will follow up on our pre-Shanghai report where we attempted to gauge the degree of true sell-side pressure expected, which we estimated to be around 170k ETH. In this report, we will assess what has actually happened since the upgrade, with a focus on the balance of withdrawals, deposits, and the entities initiating them.\n\nLive Chart\nBitcoin Weekly Video Report\n\nThe emergence of Ordinal Theory and Inscriptions have given rise to a whole host of new demand cases for Bitcoin blockspace. This week, we have seen fee pressure climb to incredible levels, driving miner revenue up almost 2x in just a few short days.\n\nReassessing Our Predictions\n\nIn our last report, we came up with three possible scenarios of what may happen post-Shanghai, based on our assessment of the technical characteristics of Proof-of-Stake, as well as the history of development in the staking industry.\n\nThe final amount of unstaked ETH is not only determined by the demand for exits, but furthermore by two technical mechanisms, the withdrawal types, and the Churn Limit. In this report, we will briefly recap how both work, for a more detailed explanation please consult the previous (WoC 15).\n\nWe estimated both how much stake would be withdrawn (789.5k ETH) during the week following the Shanghai/Capella update, and the volume likely to be sold (170k ETH). Our total withdrawal estimate turned out to be too conservative, as we did not expect the exchange Kraken to exit 125,088 ETH within the first week, amidst pressure from the SEC to close down its US-based staking service.\n\nThe actual numbers are between our estimate and the maximum possible amount. During the first week, 856k ETH rewards and a total of 232k ETH have been unstaked. Partial withdrawals accounted for 80% of the total amount of released ETH.\n\nWhen examining how much of this withdrawn stake that was actually sold, we can consult the average weekly exchange inflows over the same period. We can see that there was no appreciabe increase in inflow volume, with up to 1.8M ETH of exchange inflows in the first seven days after the upgrade. These numbers are much smaller compared to other major 'sell-side' events in the past, and very much in line with typical inflow patterns.\n\nBased on this, we can confidently say that our expectations were accurate, in that the Shanghai sell-side pressure did not lead to an appreciable increase in day-to-day trade volumes.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nExited Stake to Exceed Rewards\n\nThe upgrade introduced two types of withdrawals: partial and full withdrawals. In partial withdrawals, the rewards of each validator are automatically withdrawn and transferred to the owner's account on the Ethereum mainnet every 4.5 days. Full withdrawals occur when a staker decides to shut down their validator(s) and retrieve their staked ETH capital.\n\nTo initiate a full withdrawal, the staker must manually sign an exit message, enter an exit queue, and wait for around 1 day before the unstaked ETH is withdrawn via the same automatic skimming process that takes up to 4.5 days. In addition to voluntary exits, there are also forced exits called slashing.\n\nTo receive rewards from the staking pool, around 300k of the stakers were required to update their withdrawal credentials. In the first week, 85% of the missing credentials were updated, with more than 200k credential updates during the first two days. Currently, we are closer to the maximum amount, with 98% of credentials updated.\n\nAs a result, the withdrawal process for both partial and full withdrawals is now taking closer to 4.5 days, which was the intended timeframe according to the protocol design. For a more detailed explanation on this, please refer to our previous report.\n\nAt first, the unstaked ETH consisted to a large degree of partial withdrawals, as all accumulated rewards were released all at once. To date, 84% of the accumulated staking rewards have been withdrawn, with the remaining 16% attributed to missing credential updates.\n\nThe number of full withdrawals is determined by the number of validators exiting, which is then constrained by the Churn Limit. This limit currently sits at 1800 validators (57,600 ETH), and is applicable to both entering, and exiting validators.\n\nAfter the upgrade, the demand for exits immediately maxed out, with stake being withdrawn capped at 57,600 ETH. Since 28th April, the cumulative sum of exited stake has exceeded that of withdrawn rewards. This is an interesting development, as many analyses focused mainly on rewards as the main source of ETH sell-side pressure, however full withdrawals have overtaken partial in terms of unstaked volume.\n\nRefinding Equilibrium\n\nThe estimated annual percentage rate (APR) for validators is negatively correlated with the number of active validators. With 561k validators currently in the staking pool, the estimated APR is 4.27%.\n\nThe staking protocol limits the maximum effective balance to 32 ETH, meaning that any rewards added to a validator's balance and could not be redeployed until the upgrade. The average balance per validator before the upgrade had risen to 34 ETH as a result, with 2 ETH left effectively inactive.\n\nFollowing the upgrade and the first round of automatic reward withdrawals, the average balance has now declined to 32.39 ETH, where we expect it to remain around from now on, as rewards are automatically transferred back to the staker.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nRegularly skimming and transferring rewards back to the Ethereum mainnet will act to increase the effectiveness of stake. The ineffective balance has reduced from 1.12M ETH Pre-Shanghai to 223k ETH today, and as a result, we now see that 98.1% of the stake is efficiently used to secure the network.\n\nLive Advance Chart\nThe Path of Exited Stake\n\nAs of today, a total of 48,341 validators have exited, amounting to 1.55M ETH ($2.93B). Unsurprisingly, the day after the Shanghai/Capella upgrade 14,249 validators exiting, which remains the largest daily count. After this peak, exit events quickly tapered off, having levelled off to between 300 and 700 per day.\n\nThere was also an incident where 11 validators were slashed shortly after the update, which was attributed to human error by one of the node operators of the liquid staking provider, Lido.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOn the other side of the equation, we see over 23k validators are waiting in the entry activation queue, while the exit queue has shrunk down to just 1,837. Observing the two different queues, we see that exit events are offset by new deposits, resulting in zero net change in the active validator count.\n\nHowever, given the tapering off of exits, and persistently high inflow of new staking entrants, we expect a net increase to validator counts in the near future. This high number of new deposits into the staking pool also provides another explanation for the absence of appreciable sell pressure.\n\nUpon analyzing the composition of exited stake, and excluding slashed exits, we can conclude that the majority of exits came from centralized exchanges that offer staking services.\n\nKraken alone has withdrawn 15,501 validators, representing 496k out of the 1.55M in total exited ETH (32%). Binance follows with 6,000 deactivated validators, Coinbase with 5,179, Figment with 2,514, and Gate.io with 1,000 validators. The remaining exchanges had fewer than 1,000 exits. It should be noted that Lido has not yet enabled withdrawals.\n\nOut of the 48,341 voluntary exits, just 2,561 (6.6%) were initiated by stakers that are not associated with centralized staking service providers.\n\nSurprisingly, a large number of deposits (15,522 validators) were made by individual stakers. This supports our previous findings that this group tends to become more active around major events. We also observe a continuous stream of deposits from Lido suggesting sustained demand for liquid staking derivative tokens.\n\n(Note that withdrawals depicted in the chart below are time-shifted, based on our estimate of when the funds were received by mainnet wallets based on the duration of the exit queue, withdrawal period, and skimming process.)\n\nDespite the increased activity around newly exiting and deposited validators, the aggregate composition of the Staking Pool has remained almost unchanged. Kraken, the staking provider that saw the most exited validators, reduced its total stake by only 1.1%, while Binance reduced its stake by around 0.5%. Rocket Pool was the biggest gainer, with 2.3%, and stakefish gained 1.7%.\n\nLiquid staking provider Lido still holds the largest market share, with 33.5% dominance, followed by the staking services of the centralized exchanges Coinbase with 11% and Kraken with 7.1%.\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nSince the Shanghai/Capella upgrade, a significant amount of stake has been withdrawn. Besides the one-time event of the accumulated rewards to be withdrawn at once, we saw over 48,000 validators leaving the Ethereum Staking Pool, resulting in 1.55 million ETH being withdrawn.\n\nDespite the ability for stakers to withdraw their accumulated rewards and exit their staked positions from the staking pool, this does not  seem to  have had significant impact on market prices. This may be attributed, among other factors, to the high demand for deposits seen during this period, offsetting unstaked and distributed ETH. This trend is expected to continue in the near future, resulting in a net positive flow into the staking pool.\n\nDespite increased activity around both exiting, and depositing validators, this has not significantly altered the aggregate distribution of stake dominance among staking providers.\n\nOverall, the results of the analysis suggest that the mechanics of Proof-of-Stake for both incoming and exiting validators have played out as intended, with Ethereum's consensus mechanism remaining stable throughout the process. This is likely to de-risk longstanding engineering challenges, with net positive effects for both the security of the network, and the economy built upon it.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nAncient Supply, Mt Gox, and US Government Coins\n\nThis week, the market experienced a sharp sell-off, following what turned out to be false rumours related to distributions by the Mt Gox Trustee, and the US Government. Add to this the revival of 3.2k ancient Bitcoin, and the market found itself amidst serious volatility.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nMay 1, 2023 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has been testing both the high/low bands within the $27k to $30k range since mid-March, having recovered from $27.1k to $29.9k this week. During this rally, inaccurate rumours circulated of movements within the Mt. Gox, and USD Government controlled wallets. We also saw some activity by ancient supply holders (>7yrs), which led an infamous daily Doji candle being printed in a light liquidity environment, with $1.5k shadows.\n\nThis report aims first to address the events mentioned above which caused the volatility, and then scrutinize the demand side by emphasizing the weight of short-term investors over price action within the prevailing uptrend.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nAncient Coins Revive\n\nBy examining the volume of spent supply from 7y-10y and +10y age bands, we observe that approximately 3.2k BTC were revived this week, with 1.1k BTC originally acquired in the pre-2013 era.\n\nAfter filtering out internal transfers via entity-adjustment 🟥, we can confirm that these transfers were not internal. However, the magnitude of these incidents were not relatively significant compared to previous isolated events during cycle pivot points.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTaking a birdseye view of Ancient Supply spending, we can see that since the inception of Bitcoin, only 4.25M coins have reached the status of Ancient Supply (7+ Years). Remarkably, only 356K of these ancient coins have ever been spent, equivalent to 8.3% of the all-time total. The remaining 3.9M (20% of circulating supply) remains dormant, often assumed to be lost.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nIf we look at the rumours about Mt Gox coins being on the move, we can see that their balance has remained stable at 137,890 BTC since the first tranche of distributions in 2018, and no coins were released from this wallet. Whilst no spending was observed lately, it is expected that distributions will commence in 2023, making this balance, currently worth $3.93B, one to keep track of.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: tracking the Mt Gox Balance falling below the current level of 137,890 BTC would give an immediate alert as soon as a spend takes place, likely signalling the start of distributions.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nSimilarly, the Bitcoin held by US Government authorities has been stable at 205,514 BTC. These coins are those obtained from seizures such as the 2016 Bitfinex Hack, and the 2012 Silk Road Hack. The most recent decline saw 9,861 BTC sent into our Coinbase cluster.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: tracking the USG balance for declines below 205,514 BTC would indicate an increased likelihood of distribution from this entity.\nLive Advanced Chart\nProbing The Demand\n\nIn previous editions (WoC 12, WoC 14), we demonstrated how the proportion of wealth held within the Young Supply age bands (< 6-months) can offer a view into the demand side of the market.\n\nThe charts below show the proportion of both BTC, and USD-denominated wealth held by these recent buyers. The rising share of younger supply during a rally is an indication of capital flowing into the market. This also signals that Old Supply (> 6-months) is spending, often taking advantage of this demand liquidity, leading to a net transfer of cheap/old coins to new buyers at higher prices.\n\nThe monthly Net Position Change of young supply shows that this net sell pressure has reached and stabilized at a rate of +250k BTC per month. This wave of demand increased the total young supply by 366K BTC.\n\nCompared to significant rallies in the prior cycle, this pattern appears similar to the 2019 uptrend, which was followed by a period of equilibrium prior to the 2020-21 bull.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nA similar pattern can be observed in the transfer of USD-denominated wealth into the Young Supply region. The share of wealth held by new investors has increased from 20%, to 40% of the total, a similar uplift to that seen in early-2019.\n\nThis puts 28.2% of the total invested wealth in the hands of recent buyers, which remains remarkably low, and is still not over the threshold level of +40% seen in prior bull markets. This suggests that new demand inflows remain relatively soft, but the supply remains predominantly held by longer-term, higher conviction holders.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nRiding The Wave\n\nAfter illustrating the intrinsic relation between inflows of demand, and wealth held by Young Supply, we can derive indicators which study the behavior of these new investors, who are a key driving force of an up-trending market.\n\nThe chart below displays the average cost basis of these Young/Old Supply cohorts alongside the market average.\n\nOld Supply Cost Basis (> 6m) 🔵\nMarket Supply Cost Basis (average) 🟠\nYoung Supply Cost Basis (< 6m) 🔴\n\nThe first note is that the market has firmly recovered from the historical bottom discovery phase of the 2022 bear 🟪. More recently, the rapid spot price appreciation has driven the cost basis of new investors ($25.1k) 🔴 above all other cohorts, as in-flowing demand chases the rally.\n\nThis is the first time since Nov 2022 that the cost basis of old supply ($24.1k) is back in a superior position to new buyers (many of whom were active immediately after FTX failed).\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe next step is to seek indicators for whether the market is approaching any overheated conditions. The next chart shows the weekly Rate of Change for the aforementioned cost basis, which we can use this metric to gauge the intensity of wealth acquisition by each cohort.\n\nOverheated conditions in the past often aligned with both young supply 🔴, and the overall market 🟠 surpassing a weekly change of 4%-8%, with past instances seeing an extended correction afterwards.\n\nThe recent market surge has not yet breached the 4%/wk threshold, however, the young supply has come close at 3.4%. This observation means that the market has not yet experienced the same magnitude of rapid appreciation as was seen in Dec 2017, Jun 2019, and Jan 2021.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nHas Bitcoin Overheated?\n\nSo far, we have highlighted the significance of Short-Term Investor behavior during the rally out of the cycle lows. Next, we will focus on metrics which enable us to evaluate whether the rally reached a degree of ‘overheated’ thus far.\n\nFirst, we zoom into the average unrealized profit held by Short-Term Holders via the MVRV metric, which is the ratio between the spot price, and their on-chain cost-basis. The weekly average of this indicator, helps to identify the possibility of short-term corrections, typically seen when STH-MVRV is above 1.2, signalling a 20% unrealized profit. Macro tops tend to see even higher values, often above 1.4.\n\nRecent resistance was found at the $30k level, corresponding with STH-MVRV hitting 1.33, and putting new investors at an average 33% profit. Should a deeper market correction develop, a price of $24.4K level would bring a STH-MVRV back to a break-even value of 1.0, which has shown to be a point of support in up-trending markets.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nA more sensitive-to-price indicator, tracking similar behavior, is the ratio of Short-Term Holder Unrealized Profit vs Loss. Studying prior uptrends, we can identify three distinct areas of interest for this ratio:\n\nSTH-Supply Profit > 95% (P/L Ratio > 20): Underlines an extremely profitable position of new investors.\nSTH-Supply Profit > 80% (P/L Ratio > 4): Frequently revisited during corrections within macro uptrends, and can signal point of near-term seller exhaustion.\nSTH-Supply Profit > 50% (P/L Ratio > 1): Representing a balanced profit vs loss position for new investors. Falling below this level tends to precede a more extensive price contraction, however, there are examples of the market finding support at this level during strong bull runs.\n\nWithin the 2023 rally, we can already find several instances reaching, and reacting to all three zones, with the sell-off in early March being a perfect showcase of a reaction at zone 3.\n\nAgain, if we consider the potential of a deeper correction in near future, zone 3 would be reached at the cost basis of new investors, located at approximately $24.4K.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nRealized Profit to Exchanges\n\nExchanges are a common destination for speculator funds and the primary venue for price discovery. We can assess the capital flowing into/out of exchanges as a measure of the investor response.\n\nThe recent rally was no exception, with exchanges seeing non-trivial inflows of late, pushing the Net Position Change above +30k BTC/Month in recent weeks. This metric has fallen slightly to 22.3k BTC/Month, which translates to a smaller, but persistent sell pressure in the market.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAmong both Long-Term 🟦 and Short-Term 🟥 Holder cohorts sending coins to exchanges, the dominance of the Short-Term Holders remains a consistent 90%-95% of total inflows. Of note is the increase of profit taking by STHs in 2023, denoted by the deeper dark red zone, which accounts for 58% of exchange inflows at present.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nIsolating the share of Short-Term Holders Profit from the total exchange inflows, we see that since early Jan, there have been two waves of profit taking by this cohort, peaking at 60% of the total. Within the current market, the second wave of short-term holders profit realization aligns with the recent correction.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nConclusion\n\nIn this edition, we addressed the rumors concerning the movement of Ancient Supply, Mt. Gox Trustee funds, and supply controlled by the US Government. Given the significant size of these balances, setting Alerts is an excellent tool for providing automatic notification should their balance decline.\n\nWe also revisited the concept of Old/Young wealth redistribution through up-cycles, and utilized it to gauge demand in the market. Via an assessment of the various cohort cost basis, we illustrated how new investors influence the market, largely driven by their unrealized and realized profit performance.\n\nFrom this, we observed that sell pressure by new investors was a key driving force that established resistance at $30k. Should this present correction resume, the cost basis of the young supply holders at $24.4k may well be a psychological level to monitor in the weeks ahead.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Allure of Profit\n\nAfter an incredible quarter of price performance, Bitcoin price action has taken a breather. In this edition, we evaluate participant spending behavior to assess the markets conviction towards the prevailing trend.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nApr 24, 2023 • 7 min read\nIntroduction\n\nThe Bitcoin market found resistance this week, reverting from the weekly high above $30,456k, back down to a low of $27,169k. The opening to 2023 has been historically strong from a price performance perspective, with remarkably few significant corrections along the way, with the largest being -18.6%.\n\nIf we allow ourselves the assumption that the November low is indeed a longer-term low, we can see that the scale of drawdowns during this upswing so far, are small relative to past cycles.\n\nWith this as context, in this edition, we will focus on both the supply foundation formed over recent months, and then follow up with the profit taking behavior seen this week. We will consult several SOPR variants which offer a lens into the typical behavior patterns seen during corrections in a upswing, as compared to more structural bearish trends.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nA Supply Foundation Below\n\nWith the strong opening to 2023, the aggregate market has confidently transitioned out of a regime of unrealized loss, towards one of unrealized profit, shown by the sharp divergence between supply held in profit vs loss. As this takes place, the incentive to take profits grows.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can also see this by taking the ratio between Supply in Profit and Supply in Loss. This oscillator has achieved escape velocity this year, confirming the transition out of a regime of loss dominance near cycle lows, observed on only 415-of-4638 trading days (9%).\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nMechanically, these large rebounds in unrealized profit occurs as price rallies above the dense concentration of supply which was accumulated during the bottoming formation process. We can quantify this mechanic by inspecting the 100 day change in profitable supply coming off major cycle lows in both BTC, and Percent of Circulating terms:\n\n2011 Cycle Low: +1.99M BTC (19.8%)\n2015 Cycle Low: +4.94M BTC (32.2%)\n2019 Cycle Low: +6.86M BTC (38.4%)\n2022 Cycle Low: +4.87M BTC (25.5%)\n\nThe current cycle has seen a comparable volume of the supply re-enter a profitable position, suggesting an equally robust floor.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nExploring Profit Taking Behavior\n\nThe Bitcoin spot price is currently trading between two popular On-chain pricing models; the Realized Price at $19.9k representing the average acquisition price of the supply, and the Realized-to-Liveliness Ratio at $33.0k.\n\nThis second model is akin to a HODLer Implied Fair Value 🟠, and will trade higher when more of the coin supply is dormant in investor wallets. Spot markets fell short of reaching this level this week, topping out around $30.5k.\n\nThis suggests that the market has transitioned out of the ‘deep-value’ zone as signaled by trading below the Realized Price, and has reverted back towards a holder implied ‘fair value’ level. With this, we can also expect an increase in the probability of profit taking behavior from coins acquired at cheaper prices.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can evaluate changes in the accumulation and distribution behavior of various cohorts over the last six months using the chart below:\n\nPhase 1: Heavy accumulation post-FTX across all cohorts, effectively starting the cycle low formation.\nPhase 2: Distribution during the Jan-Feb impulse higher as the first significant rally after the brutal bear of 2022 rolled around.\nPhase 3: Light accumulation on the rally back to $28k as market momentum increased, and prices finally broke above $30k.\n\nOver recent weeks, we can see a mix of behavior, suggesting indecision across all cohorts bar the largest of entities with 10k+ BTC. This aligns with aggregate consolidation, the brief break above $30k, and the subsequent sell-off back to $27k this week.\n\nLive in Professional Engine Room\n\nFollowing on, the SOPR metric can also be used track the magnitude of profit and loss taking events across the wider market. Here, we define a framework consisting of two binary regimes, which we shall utilize to define market behavior patterns:\n\n🟥 Loss Dominant Regime: Successive prints below 1.0 indicate investors are locking in losses, whilst any returns to breakeven profitability is often utilized as exit point (forming resistance).\n🟩 Profit Dominant Regime: Successive SOPR prints above 1.0 indicates a return of profit taking. This is often accompanied by SOPR returning to breakeven being considered a near term value point.\n\nA clear shift between these two regimes was noted in January, as market behavior started to exhibit patterns aligned with a profit dominated regime. With aSOPR currently retesting the break-even level of 1.0, this puts the market close to a decision point.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can see a similar structure within the Short-Term Holder SOPR variant, as newly acquired coins have returned to an unrealized profit. The correction in March traded below the psychological $20k level, before experiencing a powerful reversion higher.\n\nThis is SOPR pattern is typically observed during constructive pullbacks, and provides a guide for interpreting moving forwards. A sustained period below 1.0 however, could signify a more onerous scenario, where underwater holders start to panic, adding further sell-side.\n\n🎓 SOPR Guide: We have a detailed metric guide for SOPR, and different variants available within Glassnode Academy for further reference.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nLong-Term Holder SOPR variant tends to better reflect macro market shifts. Following an extended period of realized losses (LTH-SOPR < 1.0), the LTH cohort are finally transitioning back into a regime of profitable spending, a structure similar once again to past cycle transition points.\n\nThis thesis was further explored last week (WoC 16), where the LTH cohort at the moment consist of many 2021-22 cycle holders, many of whom remain underwater, and are likely to create resistance throughout the market recovery.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nA Return of Capital Inflows\n\nIn this final section, we shall inspect the changes in USD denominated profit and loss events, to put the above observations into context, relative to total market size.\n\nThe chart below shows, the magnitude of USD denominated profit taken this year, remains well below 2021 cycle highs. It is however of a similar scale to that observed in 2019. It is important to note that market prices rallied from $4k to $14k in 2019, which has a peak 50% lower than our current price of just below $28k.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThis sentiment is also echoed across the realized loss domain, which continues to decline. Total losses remain quite low relative to all major sell-off events throughout 2021-22. This does suggest that a degree of sell-exhaustion has been reached at a macro scale, at least from the lens of wide-scale holders locking in significant losses (i.e. cycle top buyers).\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nFinally, we can evaluate the cumulative sum of all realized profit and loss events, more commonly referred to as the Realized Cap. After experiencing significant growth during both legs of the bull market in 2020-21, the Bitcoin network experienced a significant net capital outflow in 2022, contracting back to July 2021 levels.\n\nThe Realized Cap has finally stabilized in 2023, and is beginning to see growth, and positive capital inflows once more.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nAfter a remarkably strong start to 2023, the BTC market has run up against its first appreciable resistance, reverting the rally up to $30k. This comes alongside a very large cross section of the market seeing their holdings recover above acquisition price, creating a more favorable, and profitable environment.\n\nThe aggregate value of profits realized remain relatively small compared to the size of the asset, however, they are of a USD magnitude equivalent to the 2019 rally to $14k. With accumulation and distribution behavior across several wallet cohorts mixed at the moment, the market appears less decisive than it has been in the first quarter of the year.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nIs the Bitcoin Bear Behind Us?\n\nBitcoin has posted the strongest price performance since the market all-time-high, with several on-chain indicators signalling strength in support. In this edition, we assess whether the Bitcoin Bear may be behind us, and if a robust recovery is underway.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nApr 17, 2023 • 7 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has broken above $30k in recent weeks, posting the strongest Quarterly returns (+70%) since the Oct 2021 all-time-high. This has also been the second time weekly returns have reached +36%, firmly placing Bitcoin as the best performing asset class YTD, once again.\n\nThe strong market performance in 2023 is a stark contrast to 2022, and suggests a favorable regime shift is under way. In this report, we will explore several on-chain indicators which support this notion, and help to assess whether a robust recovery from a bear market is in play, and if the bear market may well be behind us.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAn interesting development over the last 12 months has been the increased correlation between the performance of BTC prices, relative to Gold, the traditional sound money safe haven. On a 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day basis, the correlation between these two assets is now strongly positive, remaining elevated during the recent US banking crisis a few weeks ago.\n\nThis does suggest that an appreciation for both sound money, and the realities of counter-party risk are increasingly front of mind for investors.\n\n🪟 Related Dashboard: We have recently rolled out a suite of Forex and Commodity price metrics, utilizing oracle prices found on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nSound Support Below\n\nThe Bitcoin market sits within an interesting position, whereby our Long/Short-Term Holder threshold of 155-days is approximately the date when FTX imploded. As such, we can interpret LTH and STH metrics as follows:\n\n🟦 Long-Term Holders acquired coins before FTX failed, and currently hold a total supply balance of 14.161M BTC, which is just shy of a new ATH.\n🟥 Short-Term Holders acquired coins after FTX failed, and have seen their supply balance of 2.914M BTC remain fairly constant in 2023.\nLive Professional Chart\n\nIf we bring this observation into a distribution chart of investor acquisition prices, we can see three important supply clusters:\n\nBottom Formation Cluster < $25k: These coins are those that largely changed hands between June 2022 and Jan 2023. There is an fairly even balance of LTH (pre-FTX) and STH (post-FTX) buyers in this range.\nRecent Acquisition $25k to $30k: These coins amount to 7.25% of the supply, and are much more heavily weighted towards STH coins. This reflects a combination of profit taking from below, and coins sold to break-out buyers as price rallied above $25k.\nCycle Survivors $30k+: The remaining Long-Term Holders who weathered the volatility and chaos of the 2021-22 cycle, and are still holding, amounting to 22.2% of the supply.\nLive in the Professional Engine Room\n\nWe can also view the current market cycle from the lens of Long-Term Holder behavior, expressed via changes in their held Supply. We can see three key phases:\n\nPlateau of Patience, where LTH supply tends to hover around its ATH, often from several months, to over a year.\nPeak HODL, where LTH supply in profit (dark blue) rises rapidly, and is usually associated with a run-up in prices towards the ATH.\nDistribution upon Breaking ATH, where LTHs start to distribute heavily into waves of new demand that are entering the market.\n\nThe market currently sits well within the Plateau of Patience, with over 23.3% of the supply held outside exchanges owned by LTHs who are underwater on their position. The current supply structure also has many similarities to early 2016 and early 2019.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWe can see that the YTD market strength is supported by an explosive uptick in coins held at a profit. Bear market floors are characterised by wide-scale capitulation, which by definition, has an equal and opposite inflow of demand to absorb it.\n\nAs price rallies out of the bottom formation zone, all of these coins return to profit. In 2023, a total of 6.2M BTC have returned to profit (32.3% of supply), giving an indication of just how large this cost basis foundation is below $30k.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWith so many coins returning to an unrealized profit, it follows that the incentive to spend and sell will start to rise. The popular NUPL metric provides a measure of how much of the Bitcoin market cap is held as an unrealized profit.\n\nAt the current reading of 0.36, the market is at a very neutral level, with 55.8% of days recording a higher reading, and thus 44.2% being lower. This is coincident with past cycles where a transition between a bear and bull markets have taken place. It also suggests that the market is neither heavily discounted (like it was at $16k), nor heavily overvalued (like at the $60k+ peak).\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nHODLer Holdings\n\nDespite the Bitcoin price climbing over 100% since the lows, there is yet to be any significant uptick in older coins being spent. The chart below shows that coins younger than 3-months still represent less than 20% of the wealth held in Bitcoin, which is usually associated with bear cycle lows.\n\nBy contrast, this means coins older than 3-months (HODLers) hold over 80% of the wealth, despite the brutal drawdown of 2022, and market upswing in 2023.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nBoth of the above two observations can be visualized within the RHODL ratio, which is in the process of reversing from a point of peak HODLer saturation. By this metric, the cycle has most likely turned in the favour of the bulls, however is is also no longer in undervalued territory (nor overvalued by historical standards).\n\n65.8% of all trading days have recorded higher RHODL Ratio, providing further evidence that HODLers remain the dominant entity within the market, and supply holdings.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nA Healthy Recovery\n\nWhilst HODLers are often associated with coin dormancy, the Bitcoin network remains very much alive with activity. Organic transaction counts are now over 270k/day, which is approaching cycle, highs on a monthly average basis.\n\nThis is associated with both monetary transfers, but also with the emergence of Inscriptions, which have surpassed 1 million total milestone this week.\n\n🪟 Related Dashboard: Several On-chain Activity metrics are available within a live dashboard, designed to identify trends in Bitcoin network adoption.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWith increased on-chain activity, comes elevated fee pressure. The 2yr Z-Score below is designed such that an increase in fee pressure relative to the recent bear market will stand out.\n\nWe can see that this has now flipped positive, suggesting demand for Bitcoin blockspace has increased by a statistically meaningful amount.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nBringing it All Together\n\nThe above suite of indicators consider the Bitcoin on-chain environment from a number of angles. Generally speaking, the behavior of Bitcoin investors has been remarkably consistent over cycles, which allows us to develop tools that find confluence.\n\nThe chart below is one of our on-chain signals, which uses eight metrics, across four areas, and seeks confluence pointing to a healthy and robust market recovery. As can be seen, the current market has 8-of-8 indicators in positive territory, suggesting the Bitcoin bear could very well be behind us.\n\n🪟 Related Dashboard: This chart is available within our Recovering From a Bitcoin Bear Signals dashboard, designed to identify confluence of a robust market recovery.\n\nLive Advanced Signals Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWhilst Bitcoin and digital assets experience a relatively high degree of market volatility, many on-chain indicators, which reflect collective human decisions, are surprisingly consistent.\n\nExactly 64-weeks ago, we covered how several on-chain indicators were likely entering bear market territory (WoC 4-2022: Sizing Up a Bitcoin Bear). Readers may also find our review of the May 2021 Sell-off informative, as this can be argued to be the 'psychological start' of the bear.\n\nIn this piece, we cover how several on-chain indicators are suggesting that bear market conditions (or at least the worst of it) may now be behind us. Bitcoin sits in somewhat neutral territory, and above the foundation forming supply cluster between $16k to $25k, where significant coin volume changed hands. We note that much of this supply remains tightly held by those buyers, whilst profits are being taken (WoC 12), and network utilization is improving, all supporting the strong market performance YTD.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

In this piece, we establish cohorts of stakers, and assess the potential sell-side pressure which may occur due to the unlock event.\n\nAlice Kohn, Glassnode\nApr 11, 2023 • 18 min read\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis report discusses the estimated amount of staked ETH that may be withdrawn and sold immediately after the Shanghai upgrade. After examining the different staking cohorts and their motivations for selling their unstaked ETH, we estimate a total of 170k ETH intended to be sold after the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nWe project that only 100k ETH ($190M) of the total accumulated rewards will be withdrawn and sold. Furthermore, we expect to see twice as many validators exiting, but only a limited amount of stake will be released per day. We believe only a fraction of that amount, around 70k ETH ($133M), will actually become liquid.\n\nEven in the extreme case where the maximum amount of rewards and stake are withdrawn and sold, the sell-side volume still falls within the range of the average weekly exchange inflow volume. Therefore, we conclude that even the most extreme case will have an acceptable impact on the price of ETH.\n\nThe Shanghai Upgrade\n\nThe highly anticipated Shanghai/Capella hard fork is scheduled to take place on 12-April-2023, and will enable the withdrawals of ETH funds staked for Ethereum's new Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. The earliest deposits were made in November 2020, before the launch of the Beacon chain, and until now, stakers have not been able to access their staked ETH, or the rewards they've accumulated.\n\nGiven some stakers have been active since the Genesis of the Beacon Chain, their rewards have accumulated for over two years, alongside a full bull/bear market cycle since then. This has raised much speculation regarding the potential market, and supply impacts as the approximately 18M ETH staked ($33.92B, 15% of ETH's total circulating supply) becomes unlocked. Concerns largely revolve around whether the unlocks may flood the market and temporarily create significant sell-side pressure for ETH.\n\nThe objective of this report is to assess the ETH staking landscape, develop a framework to establish staking cohorts, and assess the potential impact of the Shanghai hardfork. To achieve this, we conduct several simulations to answer the following questions:\n\nWho is most likely to withdraw staked ETH?\nWhat is an estimated volume of staked ETH that will be withdrawn?\nHow much sell-side pressure could we expect from these withdrawals?\nLive Chart \nMapping the Ethereum Staking Landscape\n\nIn order to get the full picture of the current staking landscape, we will provide a brief technical overview of the existing actors within Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism:\n\nDepositors are private individuals, or entities that send 32 ETH to the Ethereum smart contract to activate a validator. A depositor can own as many validators as they are able to stake 32 ETH for.\nValidators are virtual entities that live on the Beacon Chain, servicing Ethereum’s consensus layer. They can be thought of as a private key and a balance, both recorded on the consensus layer. Validators are pseudorandomly chosen to verify and vouch for the validity of transactions and the information included into a block. Occasionally, they are assigned to propose blocks, in which those transactions are bundled. For their work, validators receive ETH staking rewards, which are split between consensus layer block rewards, and execution layer fee rewards for processing transactions (only the priority fee goes to the validator, whilst the base fee is burned).\nNodes are the physical hardware which run the validator software. Each node can accommodate many validators. Nodes can be operated by the depositor themselves, or delegated to a third party staking service provider.\nLive Advanced Chart\nDepositors as the Primary Actor\n\nSignificant research has been conducted on Ethereum's staking economy, with much of it focused on validators as the primary actors in the staking economy.\n\nFor our analysis, we believe it makes more sense to focus on depositors, as depositors can own multiple validators, and ultimately, it is at the depositor (human) level where decisions about withdrawing funds, and usage of the funds will be made.\n\nIn order to understand the possibilities of the Shanghai/Capella update, we will segment the depositors into different cohorts based on the anticipated needs and motivations for staking or unstaking ETH. The following graphic illustrates the segmentations we have chosen, which largely consider four factors:\n\nDepositor Age: The length of time stake has been active.\nDepositor Size: The number of validators owned.\nDepositor Profitability: The unrealized profit/loss held across owned validators.\nOrganization: Splitting into Individuals (solo-stakers) or third-party Staking Providers.\n\nPlease note: We understand that private individuals or entities may use different depositor wallet addresses to deploy stake to the network. This is often the case with Staking-as-a-Service providers. Therefore, we have separated depositor addresses belonging to these providers from our datasets, and analyzed them separately. This is to prevent any distortion of the signal we are trying to achieve with our analysis below.\n\nIndividual vs. Institutional Stakers\n\nWhen mapping out the staking landscape, it is important to differentiate between private stakers, who have their own technical setups at home, and institutional/staking provider depositors. For the following chart, we exclude staking providers since many of these entities use disposable addresses for their deposits, which would distort the data.\n\nLooking at the number of deposits made per day, and we can segment between one-time depositors 🔵, and wallet addresses that have deposited several times 🔴.\n\nWe can see that one-time depositors 🔵 who are predominantly active around major events such as the genesis of the Beacon Chain, the Merge, and now in anticipation of the Shanghai upgrade, suggesting a bias towards building confidence in the engineering. Events on the execution layer such the Terra collapse and its cascading consequences did not affect depositing activities.\n\nWe also note that the staking pool consists primarily of depositors that have staked multiple times 🔴 (note the log-scale) and thus hold more than one validator. We can see that over 1000 deposits per day have been made by some of these recurring depositors. Interestingly, during the bull run of 2021, the Beacon Chain saw a relative lull in these new deposits.\n\nStaking Providers\n\nStaking providers are larger entities that allow users to delegate their ETH to the provider's validator nodes. By delegating their ETH to these nodes, users can earn rewards for supporting the network without the need to run their own validator node, or to provide the entire 32 ETH.\n\nLiquid staking providers in particular, which return users a tradable token derivative for their stake, have gained massive market share over the course of the past 2 years. Currently, Lido is market leader, holding a market share of over 30% of the entire network stake. Centralized exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance follow with a market share of 11.5%, 7.0%, and 5.4%, respectively.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTaking a closer look at the number of deposits made by staking providers over time, we can clearly see shifts in dominance:\n\nDuring the first half year after the genesis of the Beacon Chain, Kraken and Binance were the dominant depositors. However, they were eventually surpassed by Coinbase and Lido.\nLido dominance expanded massively in the second half of 2021, however the stETH token was put under market stress during the LUNA-UST collapse, as well as the bankruptcies of Three Arrows Capital and Celsius. This was due to these entities having sizeable ties or positions in the token at the time.\n\nConsequently, depositing activities by all staking providers, particularly Lido, plummeted in the middle of 2022, and slowly recovered towards the end of the year. Additionally, we observe a massive drawback of staking activities by centralized exchanges, which can be attributed to the increasing pressure by US regulators on these institutions. Kraken eventually ended its US-based staking service in February 2023 after being fined by the SEC, and Coinbase was served a Wells notice in March 2023 regarding its staking service.\n\nDepositor Age\n\nThe depositor age takes the deployment date of a validator to calculates the average amount of time a depositor is participating in the staking economy. This includes both one-time and recurring depositors, but again does not includes staking providers.\n\nWe then cluster depositors into five bins, reflecting a quarter of the Beacon Chain's lifespan (groups of 7 months), and one for those that pre-date the Beacon Chain launch. To our surprise we detected a relatively high number of 25k depositors, whose average age predates the launch of Ethereum's consensus layer. We attribute these depositors to those investors with very high conviction rate, since deploying validators at that time was highly risky. We even argue that these depositors do not see validating as an investment, but rather as either members of Ethereum's inner circle, or community members highly motivated to secure the network, rather than generate profit.\n\nFurthermore, we can see that the majority of depositors are between six months and one year old. This indicates that there has been a growing confidence and trust in Ethereum's staking economy over the past year, especially after the successful execution of the Merge and the near-term prospect of withdrawals being enabled.\n\nDepositor Size\n\nThe next step is to examine the size of individual depositors, once again excluding staking providers from our dataset. Unlike the chart above, which counted single deposit events, here we calculate the total number of validators that a depositor's wallet address accumulates over time. We then cluster these into different size bins.\n\nRemarkably, six months after the Beacon Chain launch, the staking pool became split between depositors who held only one validator (shrimp) 🔵, and those who owned more than 500 validators (whales) 🟢. During the last bull run, there were a relatively high number of one-time depositors in the staking pool. However, they decreased sharply during the market turbulence of 2022, as new solo stakers were hesitant to enter the staking pool.\n\nCrab 🔴 and Fish 🟡 entities with between 2 and 500 validators have a surprisingly small dominance of just 13.5% of the total.\n\nDepositor Profitablity\n\nTo evaluate a depositor's profitability, we calculate the realized price of their stake, which is the value of ETH at the time of deposit, compared to the current spot price. This provides a gauge on the Unrealized Profit/Loss held on average per depositor.\n\nCurrently, the average deposit price 🔴 across all staked ETH is $2,136, which indicates an average unrealized loss of -13% at current spot prices. In contrast, the realized price for the Ethereum network 🔵, which captures the average price at which the entire ETH supply last moved on-chain, is $1,403, an unrealized profit of +36%.\n\nUpon examining the Realized Price per staking provider, we observe that Coinbase and Lido's average cost base is roughly 50% higher than the current ETH spot price. Binance and Kraken, which saw primary deposit activity at the beginning of the bull run, are at an approximate break-even level between $1,812 and $1,900, respectively.\n\nThe high realized price for Coinbase and Lido is an interesting dynamic because both offer a liquid staking derivative for their staked ETH, allowing holders to sell, or better hedge their risk, with depositors potentially securing a better Realized Price in secondary markets.\n\nIf the price of the ETH stake at the time of deposit is above today's ETH price, we consider the stake to be at a loss. Not surprisingly, ETH supply that was deposited during the peak bull run between mid-2021 and mid-2022 is held at an unrealized loss. Approximately up to half of the total stake amount is currently held at a loss, which provide some insight into the potential withdrawal dynamics after Shanghai.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nTaking the difference between the ETH Spot Price and the Realized Price for ETH deposits, we deduce the aggregated USD value of unrealized profit or loss held by stakers. Combining this with our depositor size segmentation, we can start to establish groups based on the division of unrealized profits or losses among depositor types. After the peak unrealized loss of $16B in July 2022, the net unrealized loss now amounts to $4.7B.  It is mainly carried by the Whale sized depositors, who hold a 76% share of the unrealized losses.\n\nSimulating Withdrawals after Shanghai\n\nIn this section, we estimate the amount of staked ETH that may be withdrawn immediately after the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nWhilst depositors have been unable to withdraw their staked funds, they could still sign a voluntary exit message to signal their wish to exit the staking pool. There are currently 1,229 validators waiting to exit, as well as 214 slashed validators that will be forced out as soon as withdrawals are enabled (for a total of 46,176 ETH, $85.7M).\n\nLive Advaned Chart\n\nShanghai allows for two types of withdrawals: partial and full. Partial withdrawals, often referred to as skimming, automatically withdraws each validator's cumulative staking rewards, reducing their validator balance to 32 ETH. Full withdrawals involve shutting down the validator entirely and retrieving the entire stake balance.\n\nValidators undergo the same automatic withdrawal processing for partial as well as full withdrawals. An automatic sweep scans linearly through the entire validator set, starting from index 0. If a validator hasn't signed a voluntary exit message or was slashed, the excessive ETH balance is skimmed and automatically sent to the execution layer. If the validator has signed for a voluntary exit and has passed the waiting periods, it is exited. Every slot (12 seconds), 16 validators are scanned and processed. With the current number of validators, this process should take up to 4.5 days.\n\nHowever, the scanning time to skim through the entire validator set is complicated by the number of validators that have to update their withdrawal credentials. The withdrawal credentials define where the withdrawn ETH is sent to. In the early days of Proof-of-Stake, validators were deployed with 0x00 credentials. These validators need to update their credentials to a 0x01 type in order to participate in the automatic processing. Currently, around 300k validators need to update their withdrawal credentials, which is only possible after the Shanghai/Capella update. For our analysis, we recalculate the duration of the automatic process to be a maximum of 2 days, based on the actual number of validators that are eligible to be skimmed right after the Shanghai update.\n\nExpectations of Partial Withdrawals\n\nShanghai presents a special case where rewards have accumulated over the course of more than two years, and will be unlocked all at once. Currently, the excess balance, which is not actively participating in Proof-of-Stake, is around 1.137M ETH, around $2.1B in value. After the Shanghai upgrade, this amount will be automatically withdrawn from the Beacon Chain and transferred as an automatic balance update to the depositor's Ethereum mainnet address.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nAs described above, only validators with an 0x01 withdrawal credential will participate in the automatic withdrawal process. Currently, around 44% of validators have the right withdrawal credentials. However, there are many validators that still need to update their withdrawal credentials, many of which were deployed during the early days of the Beacon Chain, and have thus accumulated a larger volume of staking rewards. This was analyzed in detail by Data Always, and we have reproduced the chart below to demonstrate how the validator count of these two credential groups has developed.\n\nDatasource: Data Always, adjusted for Glassnode. Date as of: 09-04-2023\n\nBased on the ratio determined in the analysis, validators with 0x00 credentials own nearly 75% of the total accumulated rewards. As a result, validators with 0x01 credentials will have access to the remaining 25%, which is equivalent to 276k ETH being withdrawn over the course of two days.\n\nIn an extreme case where all remaining validators updated their withdrawal credentials after the Shanghai upgrade, which would occur at a rate of 16 validators per block, we would eventually see the entire sum of 1.137M ETH exit the Beacon Chain over a period of 4.5 days.\n\nThe chart below shows the minimum and maximum amount of reward payouts, including the maximum daily amount of ETH being unlocked in each case. The actual numbers will likely fall between these extreme values. We believe that many depositors may wait to unlock their accumulated rewards until after a successful implementation of Shanghai before upgrading their credentials, we therefore take a 50% withdrawal as our benchmark. Therefore, we would expect the actual numbers of unlocked stacking rewards to be closer to the minimum value of 706k ETH ($ 1.31B).\n\nTo estimate how much of the accumulated rewards will actually be sold, our depositor segmentation above comes in handy. Knowing that Lido holds a significant share in the accumulated rewards and has vowed to mainly re-stake its rewards, we believe other staking providers will follow suit, which would results in a big part of the staking rewards to be locked up again.\n\nWe can most likely rule out a high degree of sell-side pressure from the remaining cohorts as well. According to the Depositor Size Dominance Chart, around 75% of non-institutional depositors are large holders, with more than 500 validators or a stake balance of 16,000+ ETH. Depositors of this financial strength are less likely to feel pressure to sell, even if their validators are underwater. Given the positive market trend of the past week, it is more likely that this group of depositors will choose to restake or reinvest their accumulated rewards and wait for the next bull run.\n\nThis leaves us with a probable range between 76k ETH ($141M) and up to a likely maximum of 162k ETH ($300M) as a measure of potential sell-side pressure from partial withdrawals after the Shanghai upgrade.\nExpectations for Full Withdrawals\n\nLooking at full withdrawals, it is important to note that only a limited number of validators can exit per day. Since the security of the Ethereum network depends on a stable set of validators, there are various mechanisms in place to prevent heavy churn of validators, and the rapid draining of stake.\n\nThis daily number is defined by the churn rate, which determines both the allowed number of incoming validators and exiting validators. The churn limit itself correlates with the number of active validators in the staking pool.\n\n      Churn Limit =  Active_Validators/65536\n\nWith the current churn limit of 8 per epoch, and with 225 epochs per day, a limit maximum of 1800 validators can be withdrawn per day, equating to 57.6k ETH. From our historical data, we can see how the churn limit played out with incoming validators.\n\nIn addition to the withdrawal period determined by the churn limit, validators have to pass through a withdraw-ability delay. For voluntarily exited validators, this waiting period is 256 epochs, or around 27 hours long. For slashed validators, it is 8192 epochs, or around 36 days. We then again add the duration of the automatic withdrawal process, as described above.\n\nTaking into consideration our data on exited and slashed validators, and accounting for the different waiting periods, we have simulated the accumulated amount of ETH, which is accessible right after the Shanghai upgrade.\n\nAfter three significant jumps in validators signing for voluntary exits - one right after the Merge in September 2022, and two this year - we currently see an accumulated total of ETH 45,098 (equivalent to $83.3M) that will be made accessible for stakers.\n\nAs described above, the stake withdrawal process will take two days for the total amount to have exited the Beacon Chain, which means we will see at least 45,098 ETH ($83.3M) exiting the Beacon Chain between 12-Apr and the 14-Apr.\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nReferring back to our depositor segmentation, we can now determine the makeup of depositors who are likely to to initiate a full withdraw of their stake. We see that the already exited validators belong to a total of 253 depositors.\n\nWhat stands out is that very few staking providers have withdrawn their validators. So far, of the top staking providers only Coinbase has announced that it will allow withdrawals immediately after the Shanghai upgrade. Lido is said to enable withdrawals only in May, and Kraken and Binance have not yet announced dates.\n\nAdditionally, we see exiting depositors are predominantly those with only one validator, and those who deployed their stake in the pre-launch phase or first quarter of the Beacon Chain lifespan. This timeframe coincides with the beginning of the bull run, which is why we see a high number of exiting depositors to be holding an unrealized loss.\n\nWe generally expect there to be little price pressure from these depositor groups, especially if we attribute a higher conviction to those early stakers. Given the staking landscape has evolved so significantly since genesis, these early solo-stakers are likely to be inclined towards withdrawing, and then redeploying it with a new staking provider setup to reduce the risks and overhead that come along with maintaining a staking setup. They may also wish to benefit from new or Liquid Staking Derivative tokens (LSDs), allowing them to maintain their ETH liquidity, and deploy it as collateral in DeFi, all while still earning Ethereum staking rewards.\n\nKraken is expected to shut down a significant number of its validators after its US staking service was challenged by the SEC. Another potential large withdrawal could come from Celsius Network, as it will reportedly sell its staked ETH as part of its bankruptcy process, although it is unlikely both institutions will immediately withdraw after the upgrade.\n\nEven in the extreme case of a sudden rise in voluntary exits 27 hours prior to the Shanghai, we would still only see a limited increase in stake that actually becomes liquid due to the churn limit caps. At most, we can expect a maximum of 57,600 ETH ($109.4M) to be unstaked on the day of Shanghai. If the demand to exit remains high, we would see the same amount of ETH being unstaked on a daily basis until the churn limit readjusts.\n\nTo put this into context, this amount of withdrawals would result in similar dynamics as we saw in the early days of Proof-of-Work, where miner revenues oscillated around that range (albeit at sub $1 ETH prices).\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nEstimating the Total Supply Impact\n\nTaking into account both partial and full withdrawals, we can model the potential supply pressure during the first week after the Shanghai upgrade. We have three cases for the expected stake to be unlocked, and prone to be sold by the owner:\n\nCase 1: In the most extreme case, where the total accumulated rewards as well the permitted maximum amount of stake per week will be withdrawn and sold, we could see a total of 1.54M ETH ($2.93B) becoming liquid.\nCase 2: The current status quo, with only 00x0 credentials receiving staking rewards and 45k ETH to be exited and sold, would see around 312k ETH($592M) becoming liquid over the first week.\nCase 3: Our Best Estimate based on a 50% withdrawal credential update, our segmentation of depositors, and assumptions regarding investor conviction, and profitability. Also believing that the current number of exiting valiators will double around the Shanghai upgrade, we estimate a total of 170k ETH ($323M) to be sold.\n\nTo put these numbers into perspective, we can compare this to typical weekly exchange inflow volumes, with example events like FTX collapse to gauge potential scale. Here, we can see that even the most extreme case of 1.53M ETH is still within the range of average weekly exchange inflow. In other words, in the most extreme case the average weekly exchange inflow would double, which would fall into the scale of the recent market correction, with price falling 8.7% but will still be far below the scale of inflows during FTX collapse with price falling 30.2% respectively.\n\nGiven the Shanghai upgrade is widely expected and understood, based on this analysis, the unlock event is on a similar scale to day-to-day trade for ETH markets, and is therefore unlikely to be as dire as many speculate it to be.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWhile it is impossible to fully predict the outcomes of the Shanghai upgrade, this analysis sought to address circulating concerns about the economic implications of the supply unlock event.\n\nWhen looking at staked ETH through the lens of depositors, and segmenting them into different groups, we shed light on the most likely cohorts to generate sell-side pressure. The main bulk of unlocked staking rewards are expected to be from users redeploying towards liquid staking providers, which already have little need to sell due to being underwater.\n\nCurrently, there are only 253 depositors waiting to exit their stake, which is a remarkably small number. Most of them are solo-stakers, or stakers from the early days of the Beacon Chain. This leads us to believe that they are the most likely to have a high conviction rate, and withdrawals are most likely related to a change in their technical setup, rather than exiting their position.\n\nEven in the most extreme case of an exodus of validators, Ethereum’s design of the Proof-of-Stake exit queue will limit the amount of stake that can be drained form the pool at once. Therefore the economic impact of such an even would be stretched out over days to weeks. Based on our analysis, the impact on the Ethereum economy is expected to be a lot less dramatic than many have painted it to be. It is arguably more likely that the technical delivery of the upgrade will bolster a growing staking industry, which seeks to better serve holders of Ether over the long-term.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Binance Stablecoin Shuffle\n\nWith Binance firmly in the cross-hairs of US regulators this week, we investigate how the market has responded by deep diving into net coin flows through the exchange. We also assess the supply dynamics of Bitcoin, to gauge the shaking of holder confidence.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nApr 3, 2023 • 9 min read\n\nThe digital asset market continues to consolidate within a narrow price range this week, briefly reaching a new multi-month high of $29.1k. This comes amidst a continued backdrop of regulatory pressure, with the biggest new this week relating to a complaint made against Binance and CEO CZ by the CFTC.\n\nIn this weeks edition, we will assess the immediate response of digital asset holders with respect to Binance, and whether any structural shifts are found in their token reserves. We will also analyse the wider Bitcoin investor response through the lens of supply dynamics, and the movement of coins between holders.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n🔔 Alert Ideas presented in this edition can be set within Glassnode Studio.\n\n\nThe Stablecoin Shuffle at Binance\n\nStablecoins have become an integral component of the digital asset space in recent years, acting as a primary rail through which fiat enters, and exits the market. Looking back at the aggregate market cap trend of the major stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI), we can see that it has been in decline for 12 months, reaching $125.8B this week, and a total decline of -22% since the all-time high of $161.56B.\n\nSince the collapse of FTX, USDT supply has expanded back to $79.5B, now dominating 63.7% of stablecoin capital. Meanwhile, the second-ranked stablecoin USDC has seen $10B (-23%) in net redemption since breaking the peg during the failure of SVB last month. Similarly, following news of Paxos halting the issuance of BUSD in Feb, many investors have redeemed, or converted BUSD into other assets, driving the total BUSD supply down by -52% to $7.7B.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nPressure has been mounting on Binance from US regulators in 2023, with the latest news related to the exchange, and its CEO facing a CFTC lawsuit due to alleged regulatory violations. Given the degree of uncertainty related to bank and exchange solvency of late, we can assess the net flow of funds in and out of Binance to gauge market sentiment.\n\nThe chart below shows the daily net flow of stablecoins flowing through Binance on the Ethereum blockchain. A positive value 🟢 shows aggregate stablecoin supply on Binance has increased (inflows), while the negative value 🔴 underscores a net outflow.\n\nTo isolate the net daily flow, a 14-day SMA 🔵 is shown which demonstrates a net outflow of -$295M/day, which is the largest net outflow in history.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can also assess the total USD denominated asset profile held within of all of Binance's self-reported Proof-of-Reserves addresses. As illustrated, the overall USD value of Binance reserves have declined by $29.6B (-45.1%) but stabilized at $35.9B since FTX-fall out.\n\nThe primary drivers of this decline are falls in token prices (affecting non-stablecoin assets), but more recently the sizeable redemptions of BUSD. The YTD market rally has driven the total USD-denomination of Binance reserve back above $35B this week.\n\nLive Standard Chart\n\nWe can see the dramatic scale of both growth, and decline of BUSD held within the Binance platform over the 2020-23 cycle. Of note is the historically low balances of USDC ($1.16B) and USDT ($2.17B), in part a function of Binance's attempt to shift trade volume to BUSD pairs in recent months.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTo highlight the scale of Binance held reserves across assets, we can compare it as a proportion to the token circulating supply. Across the major assets BTC, ETH, USDT and USDC, Binance typically custodies between 2.8% to 3.8% of the circulating supply.\n\nHowever, we can see the scale of BUSD holdings require a separate y-axis, with some 95%+ of circulating supply held at Binance up until FTX collapsed, at which point this metric dropped to 85% to 90%.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIf we look at the coin-denominated balance of BTC and ETH held on Binance, we can see that Bitcoin reserves have increased by 67.93k BTC, and ETH balances are flat YTD. Despite net outflows of stablecoins, the market does not yet appear to be expressing widespread concern about Binance's standing. Despite the developing friction between Binance and regulators, the platform appears to be primarily experiencing a stablecoin shuffle, and remains the largest centralized exchange in the market.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nA Promising Rally\n\nWith the spot price of Bitcoin now trading firmly above the Realized Price ($19.78k), the market is trading in what has historically been a macro transitional phase (covered in WoC 12, and WoC 8). This regime is generally bounded by two pricing models:\n\nThe lower bound by the Realized Price 🔵 ($19.8k), corresponding to the average on-chain acquisition price for all coins in the supply.\nThe upper bound by the Realized Price-to-Liveliness Ratio 🟠 ($33.2k), a variant of the Realized Price that accounts for the relative degree of coin activity on-chain.\n\nAssessing previous market recoveries from protracted bear markets 🟦 into a transitional phase 🟧 shows many similarities to the current structure. As we covered last week (WoC 13), there is relatively little spending taking place by longer-term holders. This causes the Realized Price-to-Liveliness Ratio 🟠 to climb, suggesting a higher 'HODLer implied value' as a point of potential equilibrium.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nThe Investor Response Told by Supply\n\nAs we close out the first quarter of 2023, BTC prices are up over 68%, putting many investors back into profit. The reaction of Bitcoin holders in response can be observed using the Realized Cap HODL waves, which track the relative distribution of USD wealth stored in various coin age bands. Here, we examine these age bands from a binary point of view:\n\nSupply aged 3-months or less (Hot Money)\nSupply aged 3-months or more (HODLer Money)\n\nReviewing prior market cycles, we see a repeating pattern of wealth rotation from the Hot Money towards HODLer Money during bear markets (declining Supply < 3-months), and vice versa during euphoric bull markets (as HODLers liquidate at expensive prices).\n\nThe share of Hot Money is currently near cycle lows, accounting for around 10% to 15% of the stored wealth. This is typical of prior bottom formation periods. The strong market recovery has encouraged a slight wave of wealth to transfer from HODLer Money to Hot Money, driving their share up by 4.9% as profits are taken.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTo further explore this binary supply concept, we have developed a variant of the  RHODL ratio (first introduced in WoC 6). This indicator compares the wealth held by single-cycle Long-Term Holders (6m-2y) to the youngest Short-Term Holders (1d-3m). This metric aims to gauge the rotation between the extreme HODLing, and distribution points.\n\nThe current structure of the RHODL ratio suggests a notably abrupt rotation of capital starting as FTX collapsed, with coins transferring from long-term holders, towards a new cohort of buyers. This sharp decline in the RHODL Ratio can be seen in prior cycles to be an inflection point, suggesting a changing of the tides.\n\nDistance From The Mean\n\nOne of the most popular valuation models for Bitcoin is the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio. MVRV is best considered as an aggregate unrealized profit multiple held within coin supply.\n\nTo construct a tool for evaluating whether the market is close to a 'fair value', we can use a simple statistical framework based on historical values. This provides a form of a compass which shows MVRV Ratio 🟠 deviations away from its all-time- mean value of 1.8 🔵.\n\nDepression: MVRV < Low Band 🟢\nRecovery: Low Band 🟢 < MVRV < Mid-Range 🔵\nExcitement: Mid-Range 🔵 < MVRV < High Band 🔴\nEuphoria: High Band 🔴 < MVRV\n\nMVRV is currently trading at 1.4, which aligns more closely with a recovery phase. The all-time-average MVRV of 1.8 implies a price of around $36.1k, which can be seen to be a point of psychological importance, having motivated heavy profit-taking in 2016, 2019-20, and mid-2022.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe Accumulation Trend Score reflects the aggregated balance change of on-chain wallets over the past 30 days, with a higher weight assigned to larger entities (such as whales and institutional-sized wallets). Historically, The early stages of market recoveries tend to trigger a degree of distribution 🔴, returning trend scores below 0.25.\n\nThe recent rally toward the 2021-22 cycle baseline (~$30k) has created a similar investor behavior pattern to 2019, returning a trend score above 0.75 for the past two weeks 🟢.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can further inspect the components of the Accumulation Trend Score to provide a more granular analysis of various wallet balance cohorts. Here we can see that behavior across many wallet cohorts shifted towards balance increase in mid-March, with the only exception being whale entities holding >10k BTC.\n\nLive Professional Dashboard \n\nIn addition to wallet cohorts, the behavior of market participants can be evaluated from the HODLer perspective, measuring supply change based on holding times. The HODLer Net Position Change presents the rolling 30-day change in coins ageing in wallets:\n\nPositive 🟩 when coins are ageing and maturing at a greater rate than spending.\nNegative 🟥 when coin spending rates exceed accumulation and HODLing behavior.\n\nAfter a brief period of net spending during the FTX crash, maturation once again dominates, reaching above +60k BTC/month, and indicating holder confidence remains steady.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nFinally, we can inspect the status of recently accumulated coins via the Illiquid Supply Net Position Change metric. This tool describes the net flow of coins into/from wallets with little to no history of spending, which are generally speaking the opposite of exchanges' hot wallets.\n\nRemarkably this indicator shows that ~36.6k BTC/Month has been adsorbed by this illiquid side of the supply equation. This aligns with our prior observations related to the HODLers, and provides additional evidence to a case of continued confidence in market sentiment, despite the backdrop of regulatory pressure.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nConclusion\n\nThe digital asset market is under some of the heaviest regulatory pressure in many years, and yet the conviction and confidence of Bitcoin holders appears unshaken. Quite a remarkable observation given the backdrop.\n\nWhilst Binance has been in the cross-hairs of the CFTC this week, overall, there is little evidence of investors fleeing from the exchange. The primary observation is a structural shift in stablecoins hosted on Binance as BUSD enters redeem-only mode and USDC sees global dominance declining.\n\nThis is worth noting, however, as the aggregate stablecoin supply has experienced 22% reduction since the peak 1yr ago. On net, this represents a net capital outflow from the industry, however may also be a force buoying the majors BTC and ETH as investors return to holding the most trustless collateral.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Price of Time\n\nAfter several weeks of out-performance by Bitcoin prices, the market is taking a breather. Within this consolidation, we will gauge investor confidence in the uptrend using a suite of on-chain tools, ranging from exchange flows, to profit taking, and coin holding times.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nMar 27, 2023 • 7 min read\n\nThe market has taken a pause this week, with BTC prices consolidating in a tight range between $26.7k and $28.7k. After the historically significant out-performance we covered in last weeks edition, the market is taking a breather.\n\nAs this consolidation takes place, we will focus in on better classifying investor profit taking behavior utilizing a variety of on-chain tools:\n\nExchange inflows, including a breakdown into Long and Short-Term holders.\nRealized profits locked in by investors accumulating coins near the recent lows.\nLifespan metrics describing the amount of holding time destruction, to better gauge the confidence investors have in the prevailing uptrend.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n🔔 Alert Ideas presented in this edition can be set within Glassnode Studio.\n\n\nTaking Chips Off the Table\n\nIn response to the strong price appreciation over recent weeks, investors have increased the volume of coins deposited to exchanges. Net exchange flows ticked higher by approximately 4.18k BTC this week, the largest net increase since LUNA collapsed in May 2022.\n\nThis suggests a degree of profit taking is underway, as investors take chips off the table. Prior instances with similar or larger net inflows over the last cycle, have all aligned with major market volatility events, usually to the downside.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can also assess the breakdown of coins sent exchanges by either Long-Term or Short-Term holders, allowing us to explore which cohorts are taking profits. Both groups have seen an uptick in coins sent to exchanges, peaking at a total of 31k BTC this week.\n\nShort-Term Holders in dominate 92.5% of total inflow volumes, with 65% of the total being STH coins in profit.\nLong-Term Holders account for just 7.5% of the total deposit volume, however 80% of their volume is in profit, the largest uptick since mid-2021.\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nIn aggregate, a total of $320M/day in net profits have been locked in by the market on spent coins. This is the largest net profit taking since May 2022, right before the LUNA-UST project collapsed. We note that the magnitude of realized profits still remains well below typical bull market levels.\n\nIt is also apparent that the severity of net losses has also been decaying since July 2022. This reinforces our observations from last week (WoC 12) that the market appears to have returned to a more neutral gear, and resembles a more transitional market structure.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nMeasuring realized profit/loss is a powerful technique in on-chain analysis, enabled by Pricestamping coins when they move on-chain. From this, we can compare the magnitude of profit locked in over the last month, to the yearly average. Here, we can see that we have the first positive momentum cross-over since the Oct-Nov 2021 ATH.\n\nThis tool intuitively indicates periods of heavy, or light profit taking in bullish, or bearish markets, respectively. In particular, note the overall shape of the yearly moving average for Realized Profits, which trends up in bulls, and down in bears.\n\nWe will take this observation into our next related and similarly powerful topic of Lifespan.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nTracking Time\n\nIn the prior section, we observed how exchange flows can be related to the degree of profit realized by various on-chain cohorts. We can also supplement this with another suite of tools under the category of Lifespan. Rather than measuring the change in value change of a coin to obtain profit/loss, we instead measure how much holding time is spent between coin acquisition, and disposal.\n\nWhen we observe heavy Lifespan destruction, it usually means a large volume of older coins are on the move, helping us identify periods where longer-term, and more experienced investors are exiting.\n\nOur first port of call is to assess the macro landscape via the Liveliness metric. This metric elegantly defines the ratio between all-time Lifespan Destruction, and Creation.\n\nLiveliness will trend down when the market prefers to accumulate and HODL coins, building a reservoir of Lifespan, and suggesting confidence in the asset.\nLiveliness will trend higher when the market prefers to distribute old coins, and expend the reservoir of Lifespan, suggesting the asset is considered expensive.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nRecalling the shape of the Yearly average of Realized Profits, we can see a very similar shape and relationship exists with Liveliness, largely since they describe similar market behaviors:\n\nDuring bull markets, longer-term investors spend long dormant coins and realized large profits. This eventually leads to an oversupply and setting a macro market top.\nDuring bear markets, longer-term investors return to a slow accumulation strategy, and there are fewer profits taken day to day. This eventually establishes a cycle floor.\n\nAt present, we can see both metrics remain in macro downtrends, suggesting the majority of coins remains inactive on-chain.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe principle metric for measuring Lifespan is Coindays Destroyed (CDD), which reflects the volume of 'investor holding time' that is spent each day. Over the last cycle, we can generally describe upticks in CDD in two categories:\n\nSustained uptrends during bull markets reflecting a consistent distribution pressure as long-term holders take profits.\nSharp peaks during high volatility events, typically observed in bear market sell-offs. These reflect periods of widespread panic, as investors spend coins in the face of high volatility.\n\nIn recent weeks, a modest uptick in CDD can be observed, however, the magnitude of destruction remains well below typical bull market levels. This indicates that the average spent coin is still relatively young, aligning with our observation that Short-Term Holders dominate profit taking at present.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nA useful tool to compare this across cycles is Binary CDD, which converts the CDD metric into a result of one if the magnitude exceeds a long-term average (returns zero if not). Here we have also smoothed the trace with a 7-day average to create an oscillator.\n\nFrom this perspective, profit taking by long-term holders in bull markets becomes extremely apparent, highlighted as sustained periods of red and orange. In our current market however, we remain firmly within a quiet patch, typical of bearish markets, early bulls, and the transitional period in between.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe recent uptick in CDD is quite visible when broken down across the LTH and STH cohorts. Despite Long-Term Holders contributing the least to spent coin volume, their holding time is much longer, and thus they tend to have an outsized influence on Lifespan metrics.\n\nBy this measure, the recent profit taking is also fairly modest, and has not yet established a sustained uptrend in CDD.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nZooming into Short-Term Holders, the average age of a spent STH coin has also increased, effectively doubling from ~10-days in the months leading up to the FTX failure, up to 21-days today. This adds further evidence to the argument that the Short-Term Holder cohort, who accumulated BTC near the cycle lows, are the primary participants behind recent profit taking.\n\nIt also suggests that STHs are increasingly willing to wait for longer periods, suggesting a degree of confidence in the prevailing market trend.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nThe Value of Time\n\nFinally, we can bring Lifespan into the price domain, drawing on our prior research developing the Value Days Destroyed Multiple (VDDM). This metric compares the monthly dollar value of CDD to its yearly average.\n\nCurrently, we can see that the VDDM value is accelerating out of a long period trading around cycle lows. This indicates that the CDD value destruction in response to recent price action is leaving typical bear market territory, and suggests sufficient demand is flowing into the market to absorb the profits taken.\n\nThis again bares many similarities to the late 2015, 2019, and 2020 eras, which turned out to be market cycle transition points.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nAs the Bitcoin market takes a break, profit taking by investors is starting to warm up. Short-Term Holders who accumulated near the cycle lows dominate the majority of spending behavior, although their willingness to hold coins for longer periods is evident.\n\nOverall, the majority of BTC appears to be quite inactive on-chain, suggesting investors continue to have confidence in the prevailing uptrend. Similar to our article last week, through the lens of coin Lifespan, Bitcoin again appears to be entering a transitional market period.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nBitcoin Shifts Up A Gear\n\nBitcoin has out-performed this week, rallying 35.8% against a backdrop of challenging conditions for the traditional financial and banking system. In this edition, we explore how Bitcoin appears to be shifting up a gear, and rallying out of deep bear market territory.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nMar 20, 2023 • 8 min read\n\nBitcoin has experienced one of the best performing weeks of price action in history, closing up 35.8% on the week. Only 124-trading days in history have seen a larger 7-day upside rally, with just 16-days occurring from 2015 onwards. Almost all instances have occurred within bull market trends, albeit typically near the later stages of the run.\n\nThe strong out-performance from BTC comes alongside challenging conditions for the traditional financial and banking system. Concerns remain elevated regarding the vulnerability of smaller banks in an era of digital bank runs, and new liquidity funding facilities are being established between the US Federal Reserve, US banks, and swap lines with other Central Banks.\n\nWith this as our backdrop, we will explore how investors are reacting on-chain, and demonstrate via several methods how the Bitcoin market appears to be shifting gears, out of deep bear market territory, and towards a structure resembling past early bull markets. We will analyse Bitcoin from the following angles:\n\nOn-chain Momentum as several metrics indicate a healthy expansion of network usage is underway.\nShifting Up a Gear as Bitcoin departs conditions synonymous with cycle lows, and enters the 'middle ground' typical of early bull cycles.\nFollowing the Cold Money by assessing whether significant profits are being taken by longer-term holders, and whether risk of a near-term oversupply is building.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n🔔 Alert Ideas presented in this edition can be set within Glassnode Studio.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n💨 Momentum On-chain\n\nWe will start by observing the on-chain activity space, where a simple concept of 'more is better', generally applies. As more people interact and transact within the Bitcoin economy, it is typically associated with periods of increasing adoption, network effects, and investor activity.\n\nThe monthly average of transaction counts has hit 309.5k/day this week, which is the highest level since April 2021, and a significant break above the yearly average. Fewer than 12.2% of all days have seen more transaction activity for Bitcoin, a healthy sign.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Transaction Counts (30D-SMA) breaking above 379k would be an all-time-high, breaking the previous peak set at the Dec-2017 market top.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nUsing our advanced clustering algorithms, we can estimate the number of unique new entities operating on-chain as a best estimate for unique new users. This metric has reached 122k new entities/day, with just 10.2% of days seeing higher new user adoption rates, namely at the 2017 peak, and during the 2020-21 bull run.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: New Entities (30D-SMA) breaking above 378.5k would be an all-time-high, breaking the previous peak set at the Dec-2017 market top.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nAs a result, network congestion is climbing, putting upwards pressure on transaction fees. Bolstered by a new demand from Ordinals and Inscriptions, the 2yr Z-Score for miner revenue from fees has turned positive.\n\nElevated fee pressure is a common precursor to more constructive markets, coincident with new waves of adoption, expressed via increasing demand for blockspace.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nMiners are of course key beneficiaries of this influx, seeing their total revenue spike up to $22.6M/day. This week, miner revenues have lifted to the highest level since June 2022, breaking convincingly above the yearly average.\n\nSimilar to the activity models above, this is typically observed near transition points towards a more constructive market.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n📖 New Research: Shrimp Supply Sink\n\nThe supply distribution of Bitcoin continues to be a topic of great interest, for analysis of capital flows, and also for observing behaviors of investor cohorts. In this piece, we break down the BTC supply by wallet size, explore how coins disperse over time, and demonstrate how smaller holders have continued to grow their share of the Bitcoin pie.\n\nThe Shrimp Supply Sink: Revisiting the Distribution of Bitcoin Supply\n⚙️ Shifting Up A Gear\n\nAs we explored in early Feb (WoC 6), several on-chain indicators have been transitioning from conditions typical of deep bear markets, and back towards more neutral, and constructive territory. MVRV is one such metric, modelling the unrealized profit multiple held within the coin supply.\n\nThe chart below shows that MVRV has traded up to 1.36, which sits between the all-time-average of 1.82, and the 'oversold' -1 standard deviation level. Historically, Bitcoin has traded within this middle ground band for 54% of all trading days, both during late stage bears, as well as early bull market recoveries.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: MVRV breaking above 1.82 would signal a return to the all-time-average, which has historically defined the boundary between early-to-late bull and bear markets.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nGiven MVRV is a ratio derived from the Realized Price, we can back-calculate a pricing level that would correspond with these key MVRV levels. With BTC prices breaking above $27k this week, the market is now trading within the neutral zone of ±0.5 standard deviations from the long term mean.\n\nThis indicates that BTC prices are no longer heavily discounted relative to the average on-chain market cost basis.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe MVRV Momentum Oscillator is a powerful tool to identify these macro phase shifts, and it is currently in the process of breaking above 0. This indicator is very responsive to events where large proportions of the coin supply are acquired above, or below the spot price, and quickly revert to holding an unrealized loss, or profit respectively (i.e. near cycle inflection points).\n\nMVRV Momentum has just flipped positive, signalling that a large proportion of the coin supply was acquired below the current price, and is now back in profit. Similar to the metrics above, past instances of positive flips tend to also correlate with upticks in network adoption and on-chain activity.\n\n🗜️Workbench Tip: Momentum oscillators take the ratio between metric m1 and sma(m1,365)to observe short-term changes relative to the yearly baseline.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n📖 Related Analysis: Mastering MVRV\n\nThe MVRV metrics above draw on a methodology for identifying extreme deviations from the long-term mean, with live dashboards and charts available for both the Bitcoin MVRV and Ethereum MVRV.\n\nMastering MVRV\n🧊 Following the Cold Money\n\nOne of the more powerful tools within on-chain analysis is our ability to monitor the holding time of coins, called Lifespan. This allows us to identify when older coins, typically held by longer-term, high conviction HODLers are on the move.\n\nThe chart below shows the proportion of USD wealth held in 'hot coins', defined as coins that transacted within the last 7-days. This metric primarily increases when old coins are spent and take profits, transferring cheap and old coins, to new buyers at expensive prices.\n\nWhilst there has been an slight uptick in the proportion of 'hot coins', it remains close to cycle lows, once again similar to transitional periods following significant bearish trends. This indicates that despite the strong price performance, it still insufficient to motivate most owners of older coins to take profits.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can see this in Long-Term Holder SOPR, which is in the process of returning to neutral territory. Long-Term Holders (LTHs) are largely buyers from the 2020-22 cycle, and they have been locking in losses for almost 12 consecutive months.\n\nThe monthly average of LTH-SOPR is currently breaking above the yearly average, suggesting a return of both confidence, and a return of positive momentum in their spending patterns.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nFinally, taking a view over the entire market, we revisit several SOPR variants, which is a metric we also covered in last weeks edition (WoC 11). SOPR is an all-weather metric which can be used to track the degree of profit and loss realized by market cohorts.\n\nHere we have overlaid four SOPR variants:\n\n🟢 SOPR - covering spending behavior of the entire network.\n🔵 Adjusted SOPR - filtering out non-economical relay transactions (< 1hr lifespan).\n🟠 Entity-Adjusted SOPR - our cleanest filtering for the most economically meaningful spending activity across the whole network.\n🔴 Short-Term Holder SOPR - filtering only for coins acquired within the last 155-days.\n\nWe note a similar recovery structure to the 2018-19 cycle is currently underway. A healthy 'wash-out' event took place last week, with all SOPR variants undercutting a level of 1.0. This indicates a widescale realized loss event during the sell-off the $19.8k.\n\nThis week however, has followed up with the highest SOPR print since the Nov 2021 ATH, suggesting that whilst profits are undoubtedly being taken, it has yet to put brakes on the prevailing uptrend.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nBitcoin investors have experienced one of the strongest one-week gains on record, amidst a backdrop of stress, consolidation, and liquidity injections across the global banking system. Several on-chain indicators suggest that the Bitcoin market is transitioning out of conditions historically associated with deep bear markets, and back towards and greener pastures.\n\nAdoption on-chain is accelerating higher, and the majority of coin holders who have weathered volatility for over 5-months remain largely firm handed. Few longer-term investors appear to be motivated to take profits into this rally, signalling a remarkable strength, and a reflection of the beliefs held about Bitcoin's important role in the future of the global financial system.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThree Fallen Banks\n\nAfter one of the most consequential weeks of 2023, the digital asset industry is short three crypto friendly banking institutions in the US. However the principle investor response thus far appears to be a seeking safety in the most trustless major assets BTC and ETH.\n\nCheckmate\nMar 13, 2023 • 8 min read\n\nThe last week has shaped up to be one of the fastest paced, and certainly most consequential for the digital asset space in 2023. In just a few short days, three primary banking institutions in the US, all of which serviced firms within the industry, entered voluntary liquidation, or were taken into receivership by US regulators.\n\nSilvergate (SI) announced intent to voluntarily wind down on 8-Mar, in what is expected to be an orderly manner, and returning capital in full to depositors.\nSilicon Valley Bank (SIVB), the 16th largest US bank, was closed and put into receivership by FDIC on 12-March, making the $209B bank failure the second largest in US history.\nSignature Bank New York (SBNY) has also been closed as of 12-Mar, per a Federal Reserve announcement on the matter.\n\nFor all three institutions, it is expected that full deposits will be returned, whether by reserves held, or via FDIC and US regulators deposit guarantees. With many large digital asset firms, and stablecoin issuers using one, or multiple of these banking partners, the weekend turned out to be a volatile one. Of particular interest is Circle, issuer of USDC, who notified of some $3.3B in cash held at SVB, creating conditions for a temporary breaking of the $1 peg.\n\nIn this edition, we will focus on some of the key effects playing out on-chain, and within wider in market structure, including:\n\nDe-pegging of several stablecoins from $1, as well as dominance shifting back towards Tether (USDT).\nNet capital outflows from the digital asset market, observable across both stablecoins, and the two majors, BTC and ETH.\nCyclical lows hit in futures open interest, despite elevated trade volumes, and speculative interest leading to an explosive rally back to $22k for BTC, and $1.6k for ETH.\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\nBitcoin prices find themselves trading between several popular, and widely observed technical analysis pricing models. After finding resistance at the 200-week and 365-day moving average (~25.0k) in Feb, prices visited and then rallied off the 200-day and 111-day average (~$19.8k) this week.\n\nNoting that this is the first cycle in history where BTC have traded below the 200-week MA, the market is in new territory from this perspective.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nFor the first time since the collapse of the LUNA-UST project, we have also seen volatility in stablecoin prices this week, driven by fears of USDC being partially un-backed. USDC traded down to a low of $0.88, followed closely by DAI at $0.89, with the latter a result DAI's approximately 65.7% backing by stablecoin collateral.\n\nBoth Gemini's GUSD, and Paxos' USDP deviated slightly below their $1 peg, whilst BUSD and Tether saw prices trade at a premium.\n\nTether in particular saw a premium emerge of between $1.01 and $1.03 for much of the weekend. It is somewhat ironic that Tether would be seen as a safe haven amidst fears of a wider contagion sourced from the heavily regulated US banking sector.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIn the case of DAI, stablecoins have become the dominant form of collateral backing it, with this trend growing consistently since mid 2020. USDC accounts for approximately 55.5% of direct collateral, as well as a significant share of the various Uniswap liquidity positions used, in sum representing around 63% of all collateral.\n\nThis event certainly opens up discussions regarding longer-term implications for DAI, which is a purportedly decentralized stablecoin. This event however demonstrates how intimately linked DAI's price to the traditional banking system via the collateral mix (which also includes an additional 12.4% in tokenized real world assets).\n\nAs we reported in mid-2022, Tether dominance within the stablecoin market had been in a structural decline since mid-2020. However, with recent regulatory moves against BUSD, and this week's concerns related to USDC, Tether dominance has climbed back above 57.8%.\n\nUSDC has maintained a dominance between 30% and 33% since October 2022, however it remains to be seen whether supply decreases as the redemption window re-opens on Monday. BUSD has seen a dramatic decline in recent months, with issuer Paxos ceasing new minting, and dominance falling from 16.6% in November, to just 6.8% today.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nAggregate Capital Outflows\n\nEstimation of the true capital inflows and outflows into the digital asset market can be tricky, however in most instances, capital initially flows in via the two majors (BTC and ETH), or via stablecoins. Thus, the combination of the Realized Cap for BTC and ETH, and the circulating supply of major stablecoins provides a fairly robust measure.\n\nHere, we can see that the total market has a value of around $677B by this method, down around 20% from the ATH of $851B set one year ago. BTC commands a dominance of 56.4%, ETH of 24.5% and 17.9% in USDT, USDC, and BUSD, and the remaining 1.2% in LTC.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nOn a 30-day change basis, February was the first net capital inflow into the industry since April 2022, peaking at +$5.8B/month, and primarily led by BTC and ETH. The last month however, the market has seen a reversal outflow of -$5.97B, with 80% of that a result of stablecoin redemption (BUSD primarily), and 20% from realized losses across BTC and ETH.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAs the news of the Silicon Valley Bank failure hit, investors sought refuge in BTC and ETH, with notable outflows occurring across exchanges we monitor. Approximately 0.144% of all BTC, and 0.325% all ETH in circulation was withdrawn from exchange reserves, demonstrating a similar self-custody response pattern to the FTX collapse.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nOn a USD basis, the last month saw over $1.8B in combined BTC and ETH value flow out of exchanges. This is not necessarily large in relative scale, however observing net exchange withdrawals, especially within the current hostile regulatory environment, does speak to a degree of investor confidence that is worth noting.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe two major stablecoins on the other hand have seen net inflows to exchanges on the order of $1.8B to $2.3B per month. It is important to note that this is more than counterbalanced by BUSD flowing out of exchanges at an eye-watering rate of -$6.8B/month. Thus it is likely that there is a degree of 'stablecoin switching' taking place.\n\nHowever, overall, it appears to be a stablecoin in, BTC and ETH out response from the market, reflecting a remarkable appreciation for self-custody of trustless assets.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nFlushing Futures\n\nLastly, we will assess the response expressed through futures markets. This week has seen total open interest fall to cyclical, and multi-year lows for the two major assets. Bitcoin futures positions have a notional value of $7.75B, and represent around 63% of the total open interest.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nFor futures trading volume, Bitcoin dominance is similar at around 60%, and volumes have picked back up after the post-FTX and end of year lull. Total trade volume is approximately $58.2B/day, and equivalent to levels seen throughout 2022.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThe volatile price action this week was in part fuelled by a series of both long and short squeezes. On the sell-off to $19.8k, approximately $85M in BTC long positions were liquidated. This was followed by around $19M in short positions flushed out on the recovery back above $22k.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nIn the lead up to this rally, funding rates in perpetual swap markets entered an extreme level of backwardation. Traders were paying annualized funding rates of -27.1% and -48.9% to be short BTC and ETH, respectively. Traders were also much heavier short ETH, with the BTC:ETH spread hitting 21.8%, the largest since the FTX sell-off.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThis exacerbated liquidations in ETH futures markets. Over $48M in shorts were liquidated on the market recovery back above $1.6k, which represents 2.5x more notional value forced closed relative to BTC.\n\nThis suggests that ETH markets are being utilized more heavily for expressing speculative interest of late, exacerbating volatility.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWe will close with a final chart which overlays the on-chain response of Short-Term Holders (STHs), with the response in leveraged futures markets. The chart presents STH-SOPR minus 1 🔵, plotted over the annualized futures funding rate 🟠, with the following findings:\n\nBy our defined age threshold of 155-days, almost all STH coins are likely in profit, with the exception of those who acquired near the local highs.\nSTH-SOPR (minus 1) returned a value of -3.8%, which is a relatively large realized loss, and suggests local 'top buyers' dominate spending at present.\nThe direction and performance of STH-SOPR tends to correlate with that of funding rates. Both metrics reflect a different, but meaningfully large sub-set of the BTC market, with one representing spot/on-chain, and the other leveraged futures.\n\nWith this as context, it appears as though the majority of coins spent this week were local top buyers realizing a loss (other holders are relatively dormant). This occurred just before futures entered a steep backwardation, and traders opened speculative short positions.\n\nAs news of bank deposits being guaranteed broke, a powerful rally pushed BTC back above $22k, and ETH above $1.6k, catching much of the market off-guard.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nAfter one of the most consequential weeks of 2023, the digital asset industry is short three crypto friendly banking institutions in the US, and finds itself within an increasingly hostile regulatory environment. With traditional financial markets closed over the weekend, several stablecoins experienced a deviation from the $1 peg, recovering as news of guaranteed deposits filtered through on Sunday.\n\nThe response from investors has been somewhat similar to the post-FTX environment, with a net transfer of stablecoins into exchanges, and instead taking custody of BTC and ETH. However at the wider scale, the industry has experienced a net capital outflow of approximately $5.9B over the last month.\n\nThe industry, and indeed global financial system remains in uncharted waters. In many ways this week reinforces the very reasons why Satoshi created a trustless, scarce, digital asset in the first place.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nMarket Meets Psychological Resistance\n\nBitcoin prices have been rejected from a series of psychological on-chain levels, related both to Older hands from the 2021-22 cycle and also for the Whale cohort. Profit-taking and capital flows have started to take place, although they remain low by historical standards.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nMar 6, 2023 • 8 min read\n\nThe digital asset market traded lower this week, with Bitcoin coming off a high of $23,871 and falling to a weekly low of $22,199. As we will discuss in this edition, the weekly high is coincident with several psychologically important realized price levels related to both Older holders from the last cycle and Whale entities that have been active since the 2018 cycle.\n\nIn this edition, we will explore these various realized prices, as well as indicators relating to capital inflows, transfer volumes, and profit-taking that are emerging as the market attempts to transition out of the bear market territory.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\n🔔 Alert Ideas presented in this edition can be set within Glassnode Studio.\n\n🏴‍☠️ The Week On-chain is translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\n📽️ Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, or visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nMarket Contests with Cost Basis\n\nIn addition to traditional technical indicators, pricing models founded on on-chain principles can be powerful tools for estimating supply and demand boundaries.\n\nAmong various on-chain valuation models, the average acquisition price of various cohorts in the Bitcoin economy provides an estimation of price ranges which are psychologically important. The chart below compares these cost basis estimates (Realized Price) across three cohorts:\n\n🔴 Young Supply Realized Price ($21.0k), which is the average price of coins that have changed hands in the last ~6 months.\n🟠 Market Realized Price ($19.8k), which is the average price of all coin holders.\n🔵 Old Supply Realized Price ($23.5k), which is the average acquiring cost of coins held for at least ~6 months.\n\nWe can see that this week, spot prices were rejected from levels coincident with the Old Supply Realized Price. Many of these older coins are held by 2021-22 cycle buyers, who are underwater in their position.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Price breaking above $23.5k would reflect a rally above the Old Supply Realized Price, putting the average holder in all cohorts back into profit.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nIn addition to the time cohorts, investor behavior can also be assessed based on wallet size cohorts. Among all well-known entities in the Bitcoin ecosystem, Whales (holding over 1k BTC) are always often the centre of speculators’ attention.\n\nThe chart below outlines the average acquisition prices for the whale cohort considering only coins flowing in and out of exchanges. The traces start measuring at the following major market bottoms, seeking to provide the most favourable average Whale acquisition price for each cycle era.\n\n🟡 Since July 2017 , the launch of Binance\n🔴 Since December 2018, at the cycle low of the 2018 bear market.\n🔵 March 2020 at the bottom of the COVID sell-off.\n\nAll three Whale sub-groups saw their holdings go into an unrealized loss when the market plunged below ~$18k in early November 2022. Remarkably, the recent recovery stalled at the approximate cost basis of the Dec-2018+ era whales 🔴 ($23.8k), coincident with the Old Supply Realized Price.\n\n🗜️Workbench Tip: The average cost basis can be calculated using the cumulative sum of Exchange Withdrawal Volume [USD] and setting a defined start date cumsum(m1,since?)\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nThe current state of the market can be reasonably described as resembling a Transitional Phase,  typically occurring in the later stages of a bear market. This assertion can be observed in the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss metric (NUPL).\n\nSince mid-January, the weekly average of NUPL has shifted from a state of net unrealized loss to a positive condition. This indicates that the average Bitcoin holder is now holding a net unrealized profit of magnitude of approximately 15% of the market cap. This pattern resembles a market structure equivalent to transition phases in previous bear markets 🟧.\n\nWe can also account for lost coins by subtracting the unrealized profit locked in the 7yr+ old portion of the supply, returning an adjusted variation of this metric (aNUPL) 🔵. By this measure, the market is only barely below break-even, and it could be argued is still within a bear market territory.\n\n🪟 Related Dashboard: Our Recovering From a Bitcoin Bear dashboard is designed to track where a sustainable and multi-faceted recovery appears to be underway.\nLive Advanced Workbench\nA Nudge in the Right Direction\n\nA classic sign of growing adoption within a constructive transition phase is the attraction and inflow of new capital to the market. We can further explore this change in momentum through the lens of Transfer Volume, which tends to fluctuate with the aggregate level of capital in the market.\n\nThe metric below compares the monthly average 🔴 transfer volume against the yearly average 🔵 to underline relative shifts in dominant sentiment and help identify when the tides are turning for network activity.\n\nSince early January, the monthly Transfer Volume has increased by 79% to $9.5B per day. However, this remains significantly below the yearly average, although this longer-term average is heavily influenced by an unfortunately large amount of FTX/Alameda-related wash volumes (as noted in WoC 3).\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Transfer Volume [USD] (30D-SMA) breaking above ~$36B would signal return of strong capital tides.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can supplement this observation with a similar momentum chart related specifically to on-chain exchange volumes, as investors and traders typically become more active as capital enters. By this metric, we can observe a much closer monthly and yearly average, with momentum starting to rise. The monthly average for exchange flows has increased by 34% since early January, however, it remains below the yearly average of $1.64B per day.\n\n🔔Alert Idea: Exchange Inflow or Outflow Volume [USD] (30D-SMA) breaking above $1.6B/day would signal positive momentum in exchange-related flows, back above the yearly baseline.\nLive Advanced Workbench\nTaking Profits\n\nAs more coin volumes start to move around the network, we can consult the aSOPR metric to assess the average profit (or loss) realized by transactors. The 14d average of aSOPR is now trading above a value of 1.0 on a sustained basis for 40 days so far 🟩.\n\nThis pattern underlines the first sustained burst of profit-taking since March 2022, and reflects a non-trivial return of inflowing capital sufficient to adsorb the profits taken.\n\nThe return of aSOPR trading above 1.0 on a sustained basis is a typical characteristic as the market recovered from a period of deep and extended losses.\n\nLive Advanced Metric\n\nBy calculating the ratio between realized profits and losses, we can confirm that profitability has shifted back toward a transition phase. A profit-dominated regime began in mid-January, driving the Realized P/L Ratio above 1.\n\nInterestingly, there is an observable upper threshold for Realized P/L Ratio at around 2.0, which tends to act as a resistance level in bear markets, as profit-taking overwhelms weak demand. Crossing this threshold may provide a more robust indicator for growing capital inflows.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea:  Realized P/L Ratio (14D-EMA) crossing above 2.0 may indicates a sustained inflow of new capital is absorbing profit taking. Conversely, falling back below the 1.0 indicates that realized losses are dominant again, potentially indicating weakening sentiment.\nLive Advanced Metric\nDissecting Selling Side\n\nZooming in on the recent market rally, we can see that the share of supply held by new investors, which is now in profit, surged from around 2.5% (bear market baseline) to more than 15%. This pattern is reminiscent of the previous recovery from the 2018-19 bear low 🟦, and provides a view into the volume of coins which changed hands in recent months.\n\nLive Professional Metric\n\nWe can also gauge the influence of these new investors by observing the volume sent to exchanges which was either in profit or in the loss. Here we can see the following:\n\n1- The ratio of Short-Term volume in profit vs loss sent to exchanges peaked at 2.75x in early Feb, equivalent to the October 2022 ATH.\n\n2- The total volume of STH coins sent to exchanges today is around 16k BTC per day and split approximately 50:50 in Profit: Loss.\n\nRelatively speaking, this remains a relatively low total coin volume sent to exchanges compared to the 2020-23 cycle.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nFinally, we can assess the Short-Term Holder MVRV to estimate the relative unrealized profit held by STHs. As discussed in WoC 07, the possibility of STHs taking profits tends to grow during periods where the average STH is 20%+ in money, returning a STH-MVRV above 1.2.\n\nThe recent rejection at the $23.8k level resonates with this structure, as the STH-MVRV hit a value of 1.2 before stalling. Should the market return to $19.3k, it would bring STH-MVRV back to the value of 1.0, and indicate that spot prices have returned to the cost basis of this cohort of new buyers.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: STH-MVRV (7D-SMA) reaching a value of 1.0 would signal price has returned to the average Short-Term Holder cost basis and break even level.\nLive Advanced Workbench\nConclusion\n\nThe Bitcoin economy often reacts not only to levels widely observed in traditional technical analysis but also the psychological cost basis levels of various investor cohorts printed on-chain. This takes place not only with respect to their realized price but also regarding the degree of profit and loss held within their supply.\n\nFrom this lens, the market currently resides in a transitional phase, bounded above by the Realized Price of Older Supply and also by the average Whale that has been active since the 2018 cycle bottom. We have seen an initial wave of capital inflow into the space, observable through profit-taking. However, this capital wave is still infant in scale and remains historically light in total coin volume on the move.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

The NFT market is experiencing great competition, with new marketplace Blur taking market share from leader OpenSea, driven by a strategy focused on traders and liquidity.\n\nGlassnode, Alice Kohn\nFeb 27, 2023 • 8 min read\n\nAs US regulators take aim at centralized exchanges, the crypto markets appear unfazed and determined to continue their upward trend. After slightly loosing ground for the major part of the week, ETH prices consolidated around $1650 on the weekend, rising above pre-FTX-collapse levels.\n\nIn this week's edition, we take a look at the renewed interest within the NFT space, driven by the latest developments surrounding the upcoming NFT marketplace and aggregator, Blur, and its direct challenge to industry leader OpenSea. We analyze the effects of the Blur airdrop on OpenSea's market dominance, and assess the sustainability of Blur's user acquisition. We also consider whether Blurs' strategy and focus on pro traders has the potential to cause a paradigm shift for the NFT industry. Furthermore, we evaluate to what degree the renewed interest in NFTs is fostering Ethereum's network activity, and whether it is strong enough to reignite adoption.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\n🔔 Alert Ideas presented in this edition can be set within Glassnode Studio.\n\n️🏴‍☠️ The Week On-chain is translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\n📽️ Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, or visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nMarkets Unimpressed by Regulators\n\nAfter the downfall of FTX, US regulators have increased their scrutiny of cryptocurrency exchanges. On 8-Feb, the US-based exchange Kraken reached a settlement with the SEC over its staking-as-a-service product. As a result, the exchange immediately suspended staking services for US citizens.\n\nShortly after, on 13-Feb,  stablecoin issuer Paxos declared it would halt minting of BUSD on 21-Feb amid regulatory pressure coming from the New York State Department of Financial Services. BUSD holders responded quickly by migrating over to other stablecoins while having  a clear preference for USDT. Since 8-Feb, BUSD has declined by more than 31.2%, seeing over $5.052B in redemptions.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nPrior to the Paxos announcement, BUSD had achieved an 11% dominance within the $136 billion stablecoin market. Since then, Tether has gained in relative supply dominance, now holding a 54% market share. DAI has still not gained appreciable market share, nor been able to successfully promote itself as the preferred decentralized and censorship-resistant alternative, despite recent events.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nGas Prices on the Rise Again\n\nMedian transaction gas prices have been consistently low over the past nine months, ranging between 10 to 20 Gwei. This translates to an average of $0.50 for a standard transaction and around $2.00 for a smart contract interaction, a fraction of the triple-digit numbers we saw during the past bull cycle. Low gas costs indicate low demand for blockspace and therefore little usage of Ethereum's applications, which is typical during bear markets.\n\nSince the beginning of this year, however, we can observe a gradual but sustained increase in gas costs. Gas prices are currently sitting at 38 Gwei, exceeding the gas cost spikes we saw during this bear market around events such as the FTX collapse and the Binance bank run. The incremental nature of the gas demand suggests an early resurgence of network activity may be underway.\n\nLive Chart\nInterest in NFTs Reawakens\n\nUpon closer examination of the gas usage by transaction chart, we can determine that a primary source of this increasing network activity is the NFT market, which is once again showing signs of growth.\n\nAfter a steep decline in user activity towards the end of 2022, total gas consumption by NFT transactions has risen by 97% for two consecutive months. This suggests that activity around NFTs is approaching levels seen during the NFT Boom.\n\nFor an in-depth explanation of why we prefer quantified gas consumption as a measurement tool for network activity refer to: A Short History of the Etherverse\n\nWhile initially this rise in interest in NFTs is attributed to the launch of new collections by some of the industry’s largest players such as Yuga Labs, Doodles, and Moonbirds, a deeper inspection shows that gas demand during the past two weeks has been mainly driven by the developments surrounding the Blur Airdrop.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nBlur comes after OpenSea\n\nLaunched in October 2022, Blur, an NFT marketplace and aggregator, quickly gained traction and has since been nipping at the heels of industry leader OpenSea. As of today, Blur has seized a 78% market share of the NFT transfer volume, having overtaken OpenSea following its airdrop on February 14th. Blur aims to be a professional trading platform for NFTs, featuring a zero trading fee model and optional royalty payments.\n\nWhile the token has lost roughly 13% in value over the past week, the airdrop brought new attention to the upstart rival. As a result, Blur’s market share jumped by 34%, reducing OpenSea's share from 36% to 15%.  In an attempt to counter its upstart rival, OpenSea made a bold move in restructuring their fee model and policies, however, was still unable to retain its market share:\n\nWe’re making some big changes today:\n1) OpenSea fee → 0% for a limited time\n2) Moving to optional creator earnings (0.5% min) for all collections without on-chain enforcement (old & new)\n3) Marketplaces with the same policies will not be blocked by the operator filter\n\n— OpenSea (@opensea) February 17, 2023\n\nThe limited impact of OpenSea's countermove can be attributed to the differences in the platform’s user bases. OpenSea has historically attracted creators and collectors, while Blur targets professional traders. With its token rewards, Blur has successfully enhanced market depth on its platform by incentivizing users to post bids, with the ultimate goal of increasing NFT sales frequency and improve the NFT trading and liquidity experience.\n\nDue to the uniqueness of NFTs, quantifying their liquidity solely based on trading volume in relation to the total number of assets may be misleading. Therefore, examining the daily sales frequency per unique user can provide a more accurate measure of the turnover rate. For non-fungible assets, this eventually describes the rate at which individual vendors are finding buyers that are willing to purchase any NFT from the collection, and at what price.\n\nIn that regard Blur is clearly leading the race with between 4 or 5 trades per user on a daily base, while OpenSea sees on average of two daily trades per user. A higher sales frequency can create a flywheel effect, since more NFT sellers feel confident listening on Blur’s platform, creating a larger offering, which in turn attracts more buyers.\n\nAlthough OpenSea's decision to reduce fees and royalties was a response to pressure from its competitors, it could lead to a paradigm shift in the NFT market. As the two main marketplaces shift their focus from creators and collectors, towards traders, value creation for NFTs may also change, potentially turning these collector's items into a new iteration on the asset class.\n\nSince NFTs have historically derived their value from more subjective criteria such as traits, rarity, and community, price discovery has been difficult and often times been affected by market manipulation. Market making and higher frequency for NFT trading may increase market efficiency, and let NFTs be traded closer to their perceived value.\n\nA look at the sale size of both marketplaces indicates that Blur's approach also facilitates a more profitable sales environment, with sale sizes ranging between 0.3 to 1.3 ETH. Sales on OpenSea for comparison have been constant, with an average of around 0.2 ETH for many months. Note that with non-fungible tokens, sale size does not solely represent better profitability for NFT vendors but can also root from a generally higher-priced offerings on Blur's marketplace. This again speaks to the success of the platform's market strategy, and target audience.\n\nLittle Effect on Ethereum\n\nThe recent attention surrounding Blur has led to a surge in demand for blockspace, resulting in increased fees for validators, and more ETH being burnt via EIP1559. However, this has yet to have an appreciable impact on network adoption. While there has been an expansion in total on-chain activity and growth, the number of new addresses is still 40% lower than this time last year, and the monthly average 🔴 remains below the yearly 🔵, signalling negative momentum.\n\nThe latest interest in NFTs appear to primarily appeal to existing users, and are as yet, unable to attract new users to the Ethereum network. This also suggests that both NFT marketplaces discussed above, and indeed most protocols, are fighting over the same preexisting user base of crypto-natives.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWith Blur's user acquisition strategy and focus on incentivizing liquidity, it has achieved a degree of success in attracting traders, beyond the initial airdrop hype. The marketplace is on its potentially way to becoming a serious player in the NFT industry. With the platform recently announcing a second airdrop, this time rewarding users for loyalty, it remains to be seen if it can retain this newly acquired user base.\n\nThe increased competition and shift of focus in the NFT market is clearly in favor of NFT traders, who benefit from lower fees, increased liquidity, and better price discovery. Meanwhile, creators may feel disadvantaged due to the cutting down on royalty enforcement throughout the industry.\n\nThe renewed interest in NFTs, however, has not yet attracted new users, or triggered significant new capital inflows into the Ethereum ecosystem. Nevertheless, depending on the level of future NFT trading activities, it can still result in net value creation for the Ethereum network, with potentially higher MEV rewards and arbitrage opportunities, and the build out of new infrastructure for the future.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nAn Investor Turning Point\n\nDespite continued regulatory pressure on digital assets exerted by the US, Bitcoin prices still rallied above $25k, and Inscriptions breached 100k total. Meanwhile, investor behavior on-chain appears to be reaching a turning point, hinting at a new cycle.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nFeb 20, 2023 • 8 min read\n\nBitcoin has seen another strong week of price performance, recovering the entirety of last week's correction, and reaching above $25.0k, the highest price since June 2022. This market strength comes despite persistent pressure coming out of the US regulatory environment related to digital assets.\n\nIn this week's edition, we will explore the cooling down of the initial wave of Bitcoin Inscriptions, as the total number of files encoded to the blockchain passes 100k. We will also assess the behavior of Bitcoin Long and Short-Term Holders using a suite of new on-chain tools we released last week, merging on-chain cohorts, realized profit/loss, and exchanges.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard.\n\n🔔 Alert Ideas presented in this edition can be set within Glassnode Studio.\nThe Initial Inscription Wave\n\nFebruary 2023 will likely be remembered for the emergence of Ordinals and Inscriptions on Bitcoin, introducing a new way of storing data and thus creating NFTs on the largest, oldest, and most secure blockchain. What is quite interesting about Inscriptions is that they generate on-chain activity, however, with a relatively light coin transfer volume footprint.\n\nThe chart below shows that the total number of UTXOs in the set reached a new ATH of 137M. The UTXO count increased at a rate of 117k per month last week, the highest since Dec 2022.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTaproot usage reached an all-time high, with 8.121% of all spent outputs last week using the newest Bitcoin script-type. As the total number of Inscriptions crossed 100k, we have seen a cooling down of this initial wave of excitement. Taproot script usage has fallen by 65% since this peak, down to 2.872% of spent outputs spent.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe average block size has also seen a dramatic change, rising from a typical pre-Inscription ceiling of 1.5MB, to between 2.0 and 2.5MB today. This uplift in the average block size is primarily a result of Inscriptions fitting more data within the 'Data Discounted' witness portion of the transaction.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nFor a full analysis of Ordinals, Inscriptions, and the impact on the Bitcoin blockchain, please refer to our latest research piece.\n\nOrdinal Theory and the Rise of Inscriptions\nLight on Coin Volume\n\nAs noted above, Inscriptions do not require a large volume of BTC to be associated with them, and in fact, most are utilizing around 10k sats (0.00010000 BTC) assigned to the inscription. However, whilst Inscriptions are taking off, so too is Bitcoins price action, and thus the classic market analysis of investor behavior is also needed.\n\nInterestingly, despite an elevation in price action, the volume of transferred coin value remains extremely low. The chart below shows less than 115k BTC/day in total transfer volume (including the spending of the same coin) is attributed to the coins younger than 6-months old. Such low values have only been observed a handful of times throughout history.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe total supply younger than 6-months has not increased significantly year-to-date, hovering around 4.298M BTC. Since this is a binary system (older/younger than 6m), this broadly indicates that coins older than 6-months are, in the aggregate, extremely dormant at present.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThis can be confirmed by looking at the Old Supply, coins remained dormant for at least 6-months, which is very close to a new ATH of 15M BTC. We have also overlaid the total supply older than 1yr, which did cross to an ATH this week, breaking above 12.913M BTC.\n\nDespite regulatory pressure, and a 50% YTD rally, many old hands are sitting on their hands.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can see that older coins are similarly dormant, with less than 4,770 BTC on the move per day, this week. The chart below highlights the past instances with old coin volumes being this low.\n\nOf interest is that since 2016, these instances have been during bear markets and toward the lows of a significant sell-off or correction. This provides a gauge of periods where older hands are unlikely to spend, potentially signalling a perception that the market is oversold, at least in the near term.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIn a newly released Entity-Adjusted variant of the SVAB metric, we can see that just 4.123% of all spent volume is older than 6-months. Key periods where older hands have displayed a similarly subdued tendency for spending are during bear market declines throughout 2018 to 2022.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nVisualizing Investor Behavior\n\nOn-chain tools are exceptionally powerful for visualizing and modelling investor behavior patterns, both from the lens of holding time (lifespan), and realized profit/loss.\n\nFor the Short-Term Holder Cohort (STHs), we can inspect their dominant behavior patterns throughout market cycles using our newly released variant of Dormancy. STH Dormancy reflects the average age (in days) of coins spent by the STH cohort.\n\nLower values indicate STHs are spending coins they acquired very recently, and are not HODLing for long periods of time. This is typically observed in bear markets, as frustration and price depreciation motivate quick sales.\nHigher values indicate STHs are spending coins with a more extended holding period. This is typically seen in bullish impulses, as expectations of gains encourage investors to hold on a little longer and ride the market swing.\n\nA sharp upwards move in STH-Dormancy suggests this latter condition is in effect, as buyers of the lows take a little off the table.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: STH-Dormancy (30D-SMA) breaking below 17-days is a notable decrease in the average age of spent coins, potentially signalling a degree of panic.\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWe can see this profit-taking behavior in several SOPR variants, which find a degree of support on the neutral value of 1.0. An aSOPR retest of 1.0 during a bullish impulse indicates that profit-taking is slowing (which would otherwise be upwards pressure on the metric), and holders of coins at a loss are also slowing their spending (otherwise downward pressure).\n\nOverall, this signals a reduction in sell-side pressure and a potential return of the 'buy-the-dip' mentality. A convincing SOPR retest and bounce from 1.0, especially on longer-term moving averages (14D or 30D, for example), is often a signal of a shifting market regime.\n\n🎓 SOPR is a great example of an 'all-weather' on-chain metric, which can be used in any market conditions. A detailed write-up is available in Glassnode Academy.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe recently released a suite of powerful new metrics designed for our Professional members (full list here), and enabling analysis of the Bitcoin market utilizing three powerful concepts in combination:\n\nCohort Analysis (Long- and Short-Term Holders).\nRealized Profit and Loss (for tracking sentiment and capital flows).\nExchanges and Entity-Adjustment (providing our cleanest signal of economic flows).\n\nThe chart below shows the relative share of realized profit and loss locked in by the STH cohort, filtered specifically for coins sent to exchanges to best simulate sell-side forces. We can see a decay pattern in relative STH losses towards market cycle lows, as last-gasp speculators are flushed out, and coins transfer to bottom-building buyers, now with a lower cost basis.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nAs the market recovers from extended bear markets 🟦, these new STH buyers return to profit with gusto as the market rallies well above what is typically a multi-month bottom formation range. The STH cohort is thus almost entirely in profit, resulting in the majority of STH spending being profitable 🔴.\n\nWe have seen this explosion in STH profit dominance, indicative of a large proportion of the coin supply having been accumulated below the current price.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nOn an absolute coin volume basis, STHs still do not appear particularly motivated to send coins to exchanges just yet. Total STH-Exchange volume is oscillating between 15k and 21k BTC/day, a similar range it has been in since June 2021.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nLastly, we turn to the Long-Term Holder (LTH) cohort, who dominate losses locked in by investors during the darkest periods of bear markets. The chart below shows the gradual increase in LTH loss dominance, as top buyers of the prior cycle are progressively shaken from their position until the final washout. This final capitulation typically peaks near the final bottom of a macro bearish trend and right as the cycle starts to turn around.\n\nOf all realized value on coins sent to exchanges, LTHs in loss have declined dramatically from a cycle peak of 58% in mid-Jan, to 21% today. Similar sharp declines in the metric can be seen in each prior cycle as LTHs find the necessary hope to HODL, once again.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe initial wave of Inscriptions on Bitcoin has crossed a total of 100k files immutably stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, highlighting a brand new and unexpected source of demand for blockspace. Inscriptions are unique in that they do not require large volumes of BTC to be transferred, despite their value for discerning owners and buyers.\n\nDespite net growth in on-chain activity, and an ATH in total UTXOs, transfer volumes are remarkably subdued, both for Long and Short-Term Holders. Filtering only for coins sent to exchanges, we can also see that several indicators point to a turning of the cycle and a marked shift in investor behavior patterns.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Emergence of Ordinals\n\nThe digital asset market has experienced its first significant pullback of the year, alongside news of heavy US regulatory moves, and SEC crackdowns. Simultaneously, the emergence of Ordinals and Inscriptions on Bitcoin is creating a new, and unexpected demand for blockspace.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nFeb 13, 2023 • 9 min read\n\nThe digital asset market has experienced the first significant pullback since the rally throughout January, retracing from a weekly high of $23.3k to a low of $21.5k. This comes alongside significant regulatory news coming out of the US, such as the SEC issuing a fine to Kraken for their staking services, legal action by the SEC against Paxos for issuing the BUSD stablecoin, as well as several actions against crypto banking partners and payment providers.\n\nRecent weeks have also seen the somewhat surprising introduction of NFTs hosted on the Bitcoin blockchain in the form of Ordinals and Inscriptions, with over 69k Inscriptions already created. As a result, there has been a significant uplift in Bitcoin network activity, and rising fee pressure.\n\nIn this week's edition, we will explore the Bitcoin network from two key angles:\n\nThe behavior of investors during the pullback from the local high signalled by a point of high unrealized profit for new buyers.\nThe emergence of Ordinals and the unique impact it has had on on-chain activity and fee market pressure.\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard\n\n🔔 Alert Ideas presented in this edition can be set within Glassnode Studio.\n\n🏴‍☠️ The Week On-chain is translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\n📽️ Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, or visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nA Decisive Range\n\nWith the spot price of Bitcoin breaking above the Realized Price, the market has entered what has historically been a macro transitional phase, generally bounded by two pricing models:\n\nThe lower band of this zone is the Realized Price 🔵 ($19.8k), corresponding to the average on-chain acquisition price for the market.\nThe upper band is determined by the Realized Price to Liveliness ratio 🟠 ($32.7k), a variant of the Realized Price reflecting an ‘implied fair value’ weighted by the degree of HODLing activity.\n\nComparing previous periods within the aforementioned range, we note a similarity between the present market, and 2015-16 and 2019 re-accumulation periods.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe price rally has paused at a local high of $23.6k. We can inspect investor behaviour at this time by leveraging the Accumulation Trend Score, reflecting the aggregated balance change of active investors over the past 30 days. A higher weight is assigned to larger entities (such as whales and institutional sized wallets), and a value of 1 (purple colors) indicates that a wide cross-section of investors are adding meaningful volumes of Bitcoin to their on-chain balance.\n\nComparing to previous bear markets, similar rallies out of the bottom discovery phase have historically triggered a degree of distribution, primarily by the entities that accumulated near the lows. The recent rally is no exception (🔴 D), where this metric has dropped below 0.25.\n\nAccordingly, the sustainability of the prevailing rally will have some dependence on whether these larger entities continue to accumulate (🟢 A), resulting in the Accumulation Trend Score advancing back towards a value of 1.0.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can further inspect the components of the Accumulation Trend Score, to provide granular analysis of various wallet balance cohorts. We observe a shift in the aggregated behavior of investors across all cohorts, from net Accumulation (post FTX capitulation) 🟩 to Distribution-Neutral ** 🟧 during recent weeks.\n\nAmong all cohorts, the entities owning 1k-10K BTC have recorded the sharpest change in behaviour, moving from net accumulation, to marked distribution 🟥.\n\nLive Engine Room\nIn Between Cost Basis\n\nIn general, after the Bitcoin market retraces from an extreme level (such as macro tops or bottoms), the behavior of the most recently active investors tends to become a dominant factor. The chart below shows that price stalled near the cost basis of Old Supply $23.4k (> 6-months 🔵), and has both the Realized Price (🟠) and Young Supply (< 6-months 🔴) sitting below at $19.8k to $20.0k.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nZooming into recent buyers, we can estimate their average unrealized profit multiple held by using the Short-Term Holder MVRV. This metric measures the ratio of spot price to their on-chain cost-basis. Using the weekly average of this indicator, we can identify the following observations:\n\nBreaks above 1 puts new investors into an unrealized profit, which tends to signal a market transition is underway.\nMacro tops (and bottoms) continue to be remarkably similar, with the average unrealized profit multiple of +40% profit signalling tops, and -40% loss signalling bottoms.\nLocal tops (and bottoms) are often signalled by the STH-MVRV returning to a central value of 1.0 as investors react to prices returning to their break-even levels.\nThe possibility of short-term corrections tend to increase during periods where short-term holders are +20% in money (STH-MVRV = 1.2) or -20% out of money (STH-MVRV = 0.8).\n\nThe recent rejection at the $23.6k level resonates with this structure, as the STH-MVRV hit a value of 1.2. Considering the third observation, and in case of further correction, the market returning to $19.8K would indicate a STH-MVRV value of 1.0, and align with a return to the cost basis of the cohort of new buyers, and the Realized Price.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: STH-MVRV (7D-SMA) reaching a value of 1.0 would signal price has returned to the average Short-Term Holder cost basis and break even level.\nLive Professional Workbench\nPositive On-chain Momentum\n\nWith the recent emergence of Ordinals and Inscriptions on Bitcoin, there has also been a notable uptick in on-chain activity metrics, mostly related to activity, despite a relatively small impact on total supply moved.\n\nThe magnitude of wealth moving on a daily basis can be tracked via the 1-day band of Realized Cap HOLD Waves. This metric captures the relative share of USD wealth changing hand on a daily basis.\n\nWe can identify periods of elevated demand, and large volumes of wealth changing hands when we observe a substantial increase above the 1.5% to 2.5% level. This latest rally has seen only a modest uptick in this metric, rising from 0.75% to 1.0%.\nThis indicates that whilst network activity is climbing, it is not yet correlated with a large ‘revaluing’ of coins that were acquired at higher or lower prices (i.e. low degree of coin volume changing hands).\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThere is a much more noteworthy change in the number of both New and Active on-chain Addresses, which track macro changes in network activity. The following analysis compares the monthly moving average 🔴 with the yearly moving average 🔵 of these metrics.\n\nThe monthly average of the New Addresses joining the network has surpassed the yearly average since the capitulation event triggered by the FTX bankruptcy, which is a constructive sign. This metric has seen a second significant uptick this week, however, the longer-term moving average remains in a sideways trend, indicating this activity uplift remains in its infancy.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can also see this slight uptick in Active address momentum, however the macro sideways trend remains largely in a holding pattern.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe total non-zero balance addresses however has pushed to a new all-time-high of 44.06M addresses. In aggregate, this demonstrates that there has been a short-term uptick in Bitcoin network usage of late, however it is not necessarily in terms of coin volume moved. The primary source of this activity is due to Ordinals, which instead of carrying a large payload of coin volume, is instead carrying a larger payload of data and new active users.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nA New Competitor in the Fee Market\n\nAs a result of this new activity, the Bitcoin network has found a new buyer of blockspace, creating upward pressure on the fee market. Analysis of the fee market is a good gauge of higher demand for blockspace, and tends to manifest during periods of growing overall demand.\n\nLooking at the monthly average of Miners Revenue from Fees, it is evident that this indicator has not yet surpassed the bear market fee floor rate (2.5%) 🔵 for a notable period of time.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe influence of retail sized entities tends to be important for determining the sustainability of market transitions. Here, we can employ another tool to zoom on these investors effect on fee market by observing the weekly average of the Median Transaction Fee paid (denominated in USD). This is a representative metric for smaller transaction fees that are most likely attributed to retail investors.\n\nReviewing the history of this indicator illustrates that retail investors competition for inclusion in the next block has not yet revived since the market crash after the 2021 ATH.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nThe Emergence of Ordinals\n\nSince launching in late January 2023, the new emerging use case of Bitcoin for Ordinals and Inscriptions has inspired a great deal of discussion across the community. As Casey Rodarmor, the mind behind this innovation, described it in their blog, Ordinals leverage the Taproot soft fork, and numbering of satoshis (Serialization) to inscribe data into the witness portion of a Bitcoin transaction.\n\nThe effect of this new innovation has seen Taproot adoption and utilization spike to all-time-highs of 9.4% and 4.2% respectively (see our research piece for more information on adoption vs utilization).\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe impact of Ordinals on the Mean Block Size is also significant, with the upper range of mean block size increasing from a steady 1.5 to 2.0MB, to between 3.0 and 3.5MB over the last week.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThese larger blocks have stirred healthy discussions concerning the possible long-term effect of Ordinals on the Bitcoin blockchain size, initial node sync times, mempool congestion, and the state of the long-term fee market.The effect of Ordinals so far has been the setting a new lower bound transaction fee required for block inclusion. A large influx of low fee paying transactions (0 to 1sat/vbyte) can be seen hitting our mempool in purple 🟣. This differs to the post FTX panic where the mempool was filled with high urgency, high fee paying transactions shown in orange 🟠.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can also model out the number of pending blocks required to clear the mempool assuming standard 1MB non-SegWit transactions 🔴, and full Seg-Wit 4MB blocks 🔵. We can again notice a significant difference to the post-FTX period which decayed quickly as the panic settled. With the Ordinals trend, we can actually see gradually growing demand for blockspace, having been maintained over the past week.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nConclusion\n\nThe Bitcoin network and asset has experienced numerous narratives, innovations, and events over its volatile 14yr history. The emergence of Ordinals and Inscriptions was an unexpected one, and it has manifested as a non-trivial expansion in demand for blockspace, even though it may not be the classic transfer of coin wealth between investors.\n\nThis is a new and unique moment in Bitcoin history, where an innovation is generating network activity without a classical transfer of coin volume for monetary purposes. This describes a growth in the user base and an upwards pressure on the fee market from usage beyond the typical investment and monetary transfer use cases. Ordinals are a new frontier, and one that we will be studying more deeply over coming weeks, to observing how it affects and manifests in both on-chain network, and investor behavior.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

This puts the average BTC holder into a regime of unrealized profit, and demonstrates a potential turning of the macro market tides is underway.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nFeb 6, 2023 • 8 min read\n\nFollowing an explosive month of volatile price action, Bitcoin is consolidating above the on-chain cost-basis of several cohorts. Despite a -6.2% pullback to a weekly low of $22.6k, the average BTC holder is now holding an unrealized profit, with several macro scale on-chain indicators suggesting turning of the market tides is potentially underway.\n\nIn this edition, we shall explore this from the lens of spending activity in response to the recent price uptick, considering a wide cross section of the market. The goal is to identify emerging behavioral patterns to gauge shifting macro tides. We shall also investigate whether the incentive to sell is starting to overpower the opportunity cost of HODLing (and how we can identify this shift), as well as the relationship between mature and new participants, as capital begins to change hands.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard\n\n🔔 Alert Ideas presented in this edition can be set within Glassnode Studio.\n\n️🏴‍☠️ The Week On-chain is translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\n📽️ Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, or visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nA Return to Profitability\n\nWe shall begin our investigation by analyzing the realized profits locked in by the market during the most recent cycle. We can see a explosion in profit taking after Oct 2020 in response to extraordinary monetary policy. This can be seen to diminish dramatically since the peak in Jan 2021, detoxing over the following two years back to 2020 levels.\n\nAn recent resurgence in realized profits can be observed in response to recent price action, however, it remains muted in response to the exuberance experienced throughout the 2021-22 cycle.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe losses realized by the market over this same time-frame started to expand after Jan 2021, reaching an initial peak on the May 2021 sell-off (A Bear of Historic Proportions).\n\nHowever, it can be seen that the present level of realized losses has declined towards the cycle baseline of around $200M/day, with an overall contraction in loss profile barring explicit capitulation events (e.g. LUNA / FTX).\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTaking ratio between Realized Profits and Losses, we can identify structural changes in dominance between the two. Following the collapse in price action after the Nov 2021 ATH, a regime dominated by losses ensued, driving the Realized P/L Ratio below 1, with increasing severity with each subsequent capitulation in price action.\n\nNevertheless, we can observe the first sustained period of profitability since the Apr 2022 exit liquidity event, suggesting initial signs of a change in profitability regime.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Realized P/L Ratio (7D-EMA) falling back below 1.0 would indicate a large increase in realized loss dominance, indicating increased spending by investors holding coins with a higher cost basis.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio is a metric we can use compare the magnitude of total realized profit and loss as a percentage of the Realized Cap (a measure of network valuation).\n\nFrom this lens, the combined volume of realized profit and loss remains relatively small compared to the asset size. This indicates that magnitude of spending events remains marginal in scale, especially relative to the euphoria experienced during the bull market, and the FTX capitulation event.\n\nOverall, this suggests that in aggregate, most coins that are on the move were acquired relatively close to the current spot price, and thus are not locking in a large ‘realized’ payload.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nBack in the Green\n\nNet Unrealized Profit/ Loss Ratio (NUPL) shows that the recent rally has launched the spot price of Bitcoin above the average acquisition price of the wider market. This puts the market back into a regime of unrealized profit, where the average holder is back in the green.\n\nComparing the duration of negative NUPL across all past bear markets, we observe a historical similarity between our current cycle (166-days) and the 2011-12 (157-days) and 2018-19 (134-Days) bear markets. The 2015-16 bear market remains a standout with respect to bear market duration, experiencing a regime of unrealized loss nearly twice as long as the runner up (2022-23 cycle).\n\n🗜️ Workbench Tip: This chart is developed using two traces, for positive, and negative values, plotted on the same axis, and using Bar style charts to fill in the areas.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe ratio between the total unrealized profit held by the market and its yearly average can then  provide a macro scale indicator for a recovering market.\n\nThe recent surge in price action has rallied above several aggregate on-chain cost-basis models, resulting in a significant improvement in the market financial position. This momentum metric is now approaching an the equilibrium break point and bears similarity to the recoveries from the 2015 and 2018 bear market years.\n\nConfirmed breakouts above this equilibrium point have historically coincided with a transition in macro market structure. We also note that the length of time elapsed below this equilibrium point has been similar across major bear markets.\n\n🗜️ Workbench Tip: This chart utilizes the default setting of the value_at(m1) function to return the current value of this momentum indicator.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nVariants of the SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) metric can be used to inspect the aggregate profit multiple locked in by a variety of market cohorts on any given day.\n\nFor the Short-Term Holder cohort 🔴, it can be seen that STH-SOPR is now trading above a value of 1.0 on a sustained basis, displaying the first burst of profit taking since March 2022. This reflects the large volume of coins acquired at lower prices over recent months.\n\nThe wider market 🔵 has also seen a return to profitable spending, recovering after a very deep and extended period of heavy losses.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nAssessing the Long-Term Holder cohort, we can observe a persistent regime of sustained losses since the LUNA collapse. Despite this cohort continuing to take losses over the last 9 months, there are initial signs of a recovery, with a potential uptrend in LTH-SOPR starting to form.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nA Shift in Character\n\nThe Adjusted Reserve Risk metric can be used to contextualize the behavior of the HODLer class. This cyclical oscillator quantifies the balance between the aggregate incentive to sell, and the actual expenditure of long dormant coins.\n\nHigher values indicate both price, and HODLer spending is elevated.\nLower values indicate both price, and HODLer spending is declining.\n\nA structural change in the trend appears to be underway, as this oscillator continues to approach its equilibrium position (with 55% of all trading days below the current value). This suggests that the opportunity cost of HODLing is decreasing whilst the incentive to sell is increasing.\n\nPrevious break-outs above this equilibrium position have historically denoted a transition from a regime HODLing, to one of increasing profit realization, and a rotation of capital from older bear market accumulators, back towards newer investors and speculators.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can add weight to this thesis of capital rotation by inspecting the Realized Cap HODL Waves. Here we have isolated for coins held for 3 months or less, and note two key observations:\n\nThe percentage of wealth held by newer holders is increasing, albeit marginally. Since this is a binary system, this indicates that wealth must be transferring from older hands to newer ones.\nThe depth of this inflection point is very much in line with historical precedence.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nSubsequently, we can employ the Realized HODL Ratio to further supplement the above observation. This metric compares this balance of wealth held between between 1-week and 1y-2y old coins, producing a macro scale oscillator.\n\nHigher values indicate a disproportionate wealth held by new buyers and speculators.\nLower values indicate a disproportionate wealth held by long-term, higher conviction HODLers.\n\nWhen assessing the Realized HODL Ratio, both the rate of change and the trend direction are generally of greater importance than the absolute value. Currently, we are witnessing a rounding bottom structure forming, suggesting a net transfer of wealth is taking place, as well as the trend beginning to transition to the upside.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWith this as context, we can introduce a new variation of the RHODL ratio, which compares the wealth held by single-cycle Long-Term Holders (6m-2y) to the youngest Short-Term Holders (1d-3m). This seeks to evaluate the capital rotation turning point across cycle transitions.\n\nWealth can only leave the 6m-2y cohort by either maturation into a more senior age band, or via the spending of coins, resetting the age of the coin entirely. Currently, we can see a large and sharp inflection point in this RHODL Ratio variant, suggesting a significant and sudden rotation of capital from last cycle’s Long-Term Holders to a new cohort of buyers.\n\nThis market phenomena has been strikingly consistent across prior bear markets, with large inflections in capital rotation signalling a significant change in market character and structure.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nAfter an extended and savage bear market, marred by consecutive deleveraging events, there are signs that full detox of exuberance has taken place, and a cyclical transition may be underway. Usually these periods are punctuated by a sharp change in aggregate profit and loss dominance, which appears to be taking place.\n\nHowever, this trend remains young, both from the lens of duration, and of magnitude of realized profit and loss relative to the market size. As previously discussed in the WoC#45, the rotation of capital from Long-Term Holders to the Short-Term Holder cohort has been a persistent trend over the last 12-months. This is elegantly reflected in the growing wealth held by the Short-Term Holder cohort, absorbing coins from their Long-Term Holder counterparts who continue to distribute (generally at a loss).\n\nIt appears that the market is within a transitional phase, evolving from the late stages of a bear to the beginning of a new cycle. With past cycles as a guide, the road ahead remains an arduous one, with key examples being 2015, and 2019. These transitional periods historically been characterized by an extended macro sideways market, littered with local volatile moves, usually in both directions.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nShort Squeezes and Spot Demand\n\nBitcoin markets have seen the strongest monthly price performance since Oct-2021, fuelled by both historic spot demand, and a sequence of short squeezes. In this edition, we explore the dynamics taking place in both derivatives markets, and the spot exchanges.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJan 30, 2023 • 8 min read\n\nThe rally in digital assets has continued this week, with Bitcoin prices reaching a high of $23.9k on Sunday evening. The month of January has seen Bitcoin markets posting the best monthly price performance since Oct-2021, reaching over +43% YTD. This puts Bitcoin prices at the highest level since Aug-2022, and a +6.6% gain off the weekly lows at $22.4k.\n\nIn this edition, we will explore some of the mechanics underlying this rally within both the derivative markets, and the spot exchanges. We cover:\n\nThe recent futures short squeeze and a return of positive futures basis, despite declining aggregate leverage relative to market size.\nThe prevailing decline of spot exchange balances, despite a decreasing dominance of exchange related on-chain activity.\nThe market breaking above the average withdrawal price for several market cohorts, including the class of 2019+, Binance and Coinbase customers, and Whales from the class of 2017.\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard\n\n🔔 Alert Ideas presented in this edition can be set within Glassnode Studio.\nSqueezing Shorts\n\nAfter a long, painful, and gruelling 2022, the new year has opened with a notable reversal of the downtrend throughout January. As is often the case, such rallies are usually fuelled by some degree of short squeezes within derivative markets, and this rally is no different.\n\nTo date, there have been over $495M in short futures contracts liquidated across three waves, notably with declining scale as the rally played out.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWe can see the initial short squeeze in mid-Jan took many traders by surprise, setting an all-time-low of 15% for long liquidation dominance (meaning 85% of liquidations were shorts). This is an even larger magnitude relative to the longs liquidated during the FTX implosion (75% long dominance), showing just how offside many traders were.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAcross both perpetual swap, and calendar futures, the cash and carry basis is now back into positive territory, yielding 7.3% and 3.3% annualized, respectively. This comes after much of November and December saw backwardation across all futures markets, and suggests a return of positive sentiment, and perhaps with a side of speculation.\n\n🪟 Related Dashboard: We have several dashboards available for both futures, perpetual swaps, and options markets for both BTC and ETH.\nLive Professional Chart\n\nHowever, despite this return of a positive futures basis, the total open interest relative to the Bitcoin Market cap has been in decline since mid-Nov. The BTC denominated value of open futures contracts has fallen by 36% over this time, dropping from 650k BTC in mid-Nov, to 414k BTC today.\n\nNote that 40% of this decline can be directly attributed to the loss of 95k BTC worth of open interest that was held at the FTX exchange.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIf we compare the notional size of open futures contracts to the BTC balance on corresponding exchanges, we can gauge the relative scale of leverage within the market. Here we can see that this leverage ratio has declined from open interest equal to 40% of spot exchange balances, to just 25% over the last 75-days.\n\nOverall, this reflects a significant net reduction in futures leverage, and a closing out of short speculative interest. It potentially also signals a reduction in short term downside hedge positions. On a relative basis, and alongside the increase in observed shift back towards on-chain self-custody (WoC 46), this also puts more emphasis onto spot markets as a key driver of the current market structure.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nInspecting Spot Exchanges\n\nThe trend of coins flowing out from spot exchanges has been a major theme since March 2020, which to this day marks the all-time-high exchange coin balance. Today, the total BTC balance held on the exchanges we track is around 2.251M BTC, representing 11.7% of the circulating supply, and a multi-year low that was last seen in Feb 2018.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe total volume of coins flowing both in and out of exchanges is currently around $625M/day in both directions (i.e. $1.25B/day total). On net, there is around $20M in net daily flows, reflecting just 1.5% of the total, and showing that exchange flows are in a remarkably even balance. This differs to Nov-Dec where exchanges saw periods of net outflows on the order of $200M to $300M per day.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe largest monthly outflow of coins in history occurred in this Nov-Dec period, hitting -200k BTC/month in outflows across all exchanges. Today, exchange net-flows have returned to neutral, reflecting a cooling down of outflows. This may signify a slow down in new demand relative to newly mobilized spending (WoC 4), now that the market has rallied over 43% year-to-date.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nAn Evolving Economy\n\nOn-chain transactions for Bitcoin spiked by over 50k transactions per day this week, however we cannot see a corresponding increase in exchange deposits or withdrawal counts. Exchange related transactions represent just 35% of total transaction counts at present, with this dominance remaining in a downtrend since the May 2021 market peak.\n\nThis spike in transaction counts is also visible within our Entity-Adjusted data, suggesting it is not associated with a single entity, or internal wallet management. This suggests that recent uptick in transaction activity is occurring elsewhere within the Bitcoin economy.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe USD denominated volume flowing in and out of exchanges has been relatively stable for the past few weeks, however despite this, the relative dominance of exchange related on-chain volume has grown from 2.5% to over 16%.\n\nAs we noted in WoC 3 and WoC 2, global transaction volumes for Bitcoin have fallen precipitously since November. This is likely a reflection of a decline in inflated, large size on-chain volumes occurring between Aug-2021 and Nov-2022, due largely to the industry-wide deleveraging, and wallet mismanagement by the FTX/Alameda entity.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nUsually, market strength is accompanied by an increase in total on-chain exchange volumes, as investors and traders become more active. With the above as context, we can see that there remains a negative aggregate momentum within exchange transfer volumes. The monthly average is starting to increase, however it remains well below the yearly baseline at this stage.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Exchange Inflow or Outflow Volume [USD] (30D-SMA) breaking above $875M would signal an increase in recent exchange related flows back towards the yearly baseline.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nSpecifically looking to Whale entities, holding over 1k BTC, we can also see an uptick in both deposit and withdrawal volumes to exchanges. Throughout January, Whale entities have contributed between $185M to $215M to total exchange inflows (and outflows), with a net bias of around $25M in net withdrawal volumes.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nAn Average Acquisition Price\n\nWith such large volumes of coins flowing both in, and out of exchanges, we can estimate the average acquisition price for various cohorts of the Bitcoin economy. This first chart models the average acquisition price by yearly class, starting the calculation on the 1-Jan each year, and modelling a sort of long-only DCA cost basis.\n\nThrough the 2022 downtrend, only those investors from 2017 and earlier avoided hitting a net unrealized loss, with the class of 2018+ seeing their cost basis taken out by the FTX red candle. The current rally however has pushed the class of 2019 ($21.8k) and earlier back into an unrealized profit.\n\n🗜️ Workbench Tip: This average withdrawal price can be calculated using the cumulative sum function and setting a defined start date cumsum(m1,since?)\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can create a similar model per exchange, with the chart below showing that recent price action intersected three key cost basis levels:\n\n🟠 The all-exchange, all-time withdrawal price was intersected at $16.7k, and provided a form of support during the end of year consolidation range.\n🟡 + 🔵 The average withdrawal price since Jul-2017 for Coinbase and Binance, the two largest exchanges, was just broken through around $21k.\n\nIn line with our report last week (WoC 4), this can also be seen within metrics like Percent Supply in Profit, which have increased dramatically as prices rise above their on-chain acquisition price.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nFinally, we return to our Whale cohort discussed earlier, however this time reviewing their average acquisition prices since major market bottoms. By starting these traces at market lows, we can assess this cohorts most favourable possible prices.\n\nWhat we see is that even the average whale, that has been active since the 2017 market 🟡, saw their holdings go into an unrealized loss in 2022 as prices broke below $18k. The cohort since the March 2020 lows have an acquisition price of $23.8k, which is sitting immediately above spot prices at the time of writing.\n\nAll three of these models demonstrate just how unforgiving the 2022-23 bear market has been, driving cohorts with even the most favourable starting points into an unrealized loss.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nAs the end of January approaches, Bitcoin markets have seen the strongest monthly price performance since Oct-2021, fuelled by both historic spot demand, and a sequence of short squeezes. This rally has brought a large portion of the market back into profit, and resulted in futures markets trading at a healthy contango. We also note that initial impulse of exchange outflows, in the aftermath of FTX have calmed to neutral, and are now balanced by newly motivated inflows.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nAn Opportunity, or a Trap?\n\nThe recent market rally has pushed BTC prices above $23k, and has surprised many investors. However, alongside higher prices, comes an increased motivation for holders and miners to take exit liquidity, especially after the prolonged and painful bear of 2022.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nJan 23, 2023 • 8 min read\n\nThe recent market bounce from the FTX fall-out trading range to levels above the Realized Price ($19.7k) has surprised many investors, inspiring them to respond accordingly.\n\nAs this article will discuss the noteworthy shifts in behavior for new investors (Short-term Holders), Long-Term Holders, and miners. For new investors and miners, the recent rally has motivated spending, taking the opportunity to exit and secure some profit. On the other hand, we have seen more resilience for long-term holders, with coins crossing the 6-month age threshold and pushing to new highs.\n\nExploring the response of both long and short-term cohorts, this report aims to inspect how the recent shift in profitability plays a role in changing the behavior patterns of market participants.\n\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard\n\n🔔 Alert Ideas presented in this edition can be set within Glassnode Studio.\n\n️🏴‍☠️ The Week On-chain is translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\n📽️ Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, or visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nAlmost Out of The Woods\n\nThe recent surge in price action to the $21k to $23k region involved reclaiming multiple on-chain pricing models, which has historically signified a psychological shift in holder behavior patterns.\n\nThe chart below presents two specific models from our Pricing Model Dashboard where:\n\n🟢 Investor Price ($17.4k) is derived from the difference between the Realized Cap and the Thermocap. It reflects the average acquisition price for all coins which have been spent and distributed by miners.\n🟣 Delta Price ($11.4k) is calculated from the difference between Realized Cap and the all-time Average Cap. This produces a combined on-chain and technical pricing concept.\n\nSurprisingly, price action across the 2018-2019 and the current bear market bottom discovery phase have spent a similar amount of time within the bounds of the Investor-Delta price band. This suggests an equivalency in durational pain across the darkest phase of both bear markets.\n\n🪟 Related Dashboard: A diverse suite of models tracking cohort cost basis, fair value estimates, and mining cost of production are available in the BTC: Pricing Models dashboard for Advanced members.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nIn addition to the duration component of the bottom discovery phase, we can measure the compression of the Investor-Delta Price range as a proxy for the intensity of market undervaluation.  As displayed above ↕️, the compression of this range is correlated with the magnitude of change in the Realized Cap or volume of capital inflow into the market.\n\nCompression = (Investor Price - Delta Price)/Spot Price\n\nAssessing the historical trend of this Delta-to-Investor compression concept indicates a threshold zone (0.15-0.2 🟥) that can be employed for seeking confirmation for the beginning ↗️ and end ↘️ of the Bottom Discovery phase.\n\nConsidering the current price and compression value, a similar confirmation signal will be triggered when the market price reclaims $28.3k.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nLight at The End of The Tunnel\n\nAlongside the assessment of pricing models, we can investigate other on-chain measures to estimate the sustainability and strength of current market momentum.\n\nPercent Supply in Profit is an insightful metric to track when a market recovery may be underway, transitioning out of a bottom discovery phase (a loss-dominant regime) 🟥 back towards a healthier equilibrium between profit and loss 🟧. This transitional period can be considered active whilst the weekly average of the Percent Supply in Profit resides between 55% and 80%.\n\nThe recent rally from $16.9k to $23.1k has shown confluence with the Percent of Supply in Profit abruptly surging from 55% to over 67%. This 12% surge over 14 days has been one of the sharpest spikes in profitability compared to prior bear markets. This provides an indication of how much coin volume transacted and changed hands below $23.3k.\n\n🗜️ Workbench Tip: These colored areas are established using the if-then statement, which highlights prices when a particular Percent Supply in Profit value is reached.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nHistorically, any abrupt change in supply (unrealized) profitability has motivated investors to react, which can be measured using metrics that describe Realized Profit and Loss.\n\nThe Realized Profit and Loss metrics measures the difference between the value of coins at the time of disposal and the time of acquisition. The chart below displays the weekly aggregated volume of Realized Profit and Loss alongside the Net Realized Profit and Loss. To compare magnitude across cycles, each trace is normalized by Market Cap.\n\n🟩 The 7-day sum Realized Profit [USD].\n🟥 The 7-day sum Realized Loss [USD].\n🔵  The net 7-day sub of Realized Profit minus Loss.\n\nThe current bear, which started in November 2021, has undergone two remarkably large capitulation events, realizing a net loss of  -2.9% and -3.7% of market cap per week, respectively. This regime has now shifted to one of Profit-Dominance, a promising sign of healing after the heavy deleveraging pressures inflicted in the second half of 2022.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nAn Opportunity For New Investors\n\nWhen the market is in a prolonged bottom (or top) discovery stage, new investor behavior becomes an influential factor in forming local recovery (or correction) pivot points. We can assess this behavior via the Percentage of Short-Term Holder Supply in Profit 🔵.\n\nInterestingly, during bear markets, when > 97.5% of the acquired supply by new investors is in loss 🟥 the chance of seller exhaustion rises exponentially. Conversely, when > 97.5% of short-term holder supply is in profit, these players tend to seize the opportunity and exit at break-even or profit 🟩.\n\nThe recent surge to $23K has pushed this metric to > 97.5% in profit for the first time since the ATH in November 2021. Given this substantial spike in profitability, the probability of sell pressure sourced from STHs is likely to grow accordingly.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nLooking at the spending volume of these newer holders through the Spent Volume Age Bands (SVAB) (30D-EMA) metric, we can see how this spike in profitability has driven the cohort’s spending volume well above the long-term declining trend.\n\nTherefore, the sustainability of the current rally can be considered a balance between inflowing and newly deployed demand, meeting the supply drawn out of investor wallets by these higher prices.\n\nLive Advanced Metric\nPersistent Conviction\n\nAssessing the profitability and behavior of short-term holders in isolation does not provide a full-scope assessment of the market. Therefore we shall perform the same study but focus on the long-term holder cohort, many of which are 2021-22 investors that remain overwhelmingly underwater on their holdings.\n\nThe LTH-MVRV 🟠 compares the cost-basis of the long-term holder cohort against spot prices, providing insight into the unrealized profit or loss held.\n\nTracing this metric shows that after 6.5 months, the market price has finally recovered above the long-term holders' cost basis at $22.6k. This denotes that the average LTH is only just above their break-even basis.\n\nConsidering the time length of LTH-MVRV traded below 1 🟩 and the lowest printed value, the ongoing bear market has been very comparable with 2018-2019 so far.\n\nLive Professional Metric\n\nDespite the recovery from a historically undervalued condition, remarkably, the volume of coins aged more than 6 months (Old-Supply) 🔵 has increased by 301k BTC since early December. This divergence highlights the strength of the HODLing conviction via the recent market rally.\n\nIn other words, the supply held by HODLers has shifted from a contraction of -314k BTC/month following FTX collapsing, to an expansion at a rate of +100k BTC/month.\n\n🪟 Related Dashboard: More information on the behavior of long and short-term holders can be found on our BTC: HODL Wave Dynamics dashboard for Advanced members.\nLive Advanced Workbench\nMiners Selling into Rally\n\nSimilar to the short-term holders, Miners have also taken advantage of the recent price appreciation to shore up their balance sheets.\n\nThe Puell Multiple 🟠 is the ratio between the aggregate miners' daily income (USD-denominated) to their yearly average. It shows that the relative miner revenue has increased by 254% compared to early January, highlighting how immense the financial stress experienced by the industry has been throughout the bear market.\n\nLive Advanced Metric\n\nWith a notable recovery in miner USD-denominated revenues, the resulting behavior shift has switched from accumulation of +8.5k BTC/month, to distribution of -1.6k BTC/month. Miners have spent some -5.6k BTC since 8-Jan and have experienced a net balance decline YTD.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nConclusion\n\nThe recent price recovery from the December lows to over $23.2k has significantly improved investor profitability across the board. Consulting the price models, we can see that the recent rally has reclaimed several cost-basis models and pushed the proposition of supply held at a profit into the more favourable territory.\n\nHowever, higher prices and the allure of profits after an extended bear market tend to motivate supply to re-enter liquid circulation. Analysis of cohort behavior shows that short-term holders and miners have been motivated by the opportunity to liquidate a portion of their holdings.\n\nOn the contrary, the supply held by long-term holders continues to grow, which can be argued to be a signal of strength and conviction across this cohort. Given the effect of long-term holders on the macro trend, watching their spending is likely a key toolset to track over the coming weeks.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nIs Bitcoin Back?\n\nAfter one of the least volatile months in history, Bitcoin has seen an explosive rally back above $21k. This puts the average BTC holder, and mining operation back into the black, making this rally stand out from all those seen in 2022.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJan 16, 2023 • 8 min read\n\nAfter one of the least volatile periods in Bitcoin history (WoC 2), the market pulled off a remarkable and explosive 23.3% rally this week. BTC prices rallied from a weekly low of $17k to over $21k, breaking through several widely observed technical and on-chain pricing models. Many of these models tend to act as significant psychological resistance levels during bear markets, which makes this particular event noteworthy.\n\nIn this edition, we will cover a variety of pricing models that seek to describe Bitcoin price action, and the underlying fundamentals, including:\n\nKey technical and on-chain levels, such as the 200D-SMA, and the Realized Price for various investor cohorts.\nEstimated points of stress for the average miner, potentially signalling a reduction in acute income stress for the industry.\nFair value models based on network volume throughput, which attempt to gauge an implied value based on settlement activity.\nRecovery of short term realized profits, which have historically shown to be a key indicator of shifting investor behavior patterns.\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard\n\n🔔 Alert Ideas presented in this edition can be set within Glassnode Studio.\n\n️🏴‍☠️ The Week On-chain is translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\n📽️ Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, or visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nBack in the Black\n\nThe 200D-SMA remains one of the most widely used technical analysis tools across all asset classes, often finding application as a litmus test for macro market trends. This has proven true over the years for Bitcoin, where a simple check of whether price is above or below the 200D-SMA tending to correlate with a macro bullish, or bearish trend, respectively.\n\nWith this weeks powerful rally, the market overcame this psychological level at $19.5k. Bitcoin markets often express a strangely consistent cyclical behavior, with this cycle trading below the 200D-SMA for 381-days, which is just 5-days shy the 2018-19 bear market at 386-days.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Price breaking below $19.5k would reflect a fall back below the 200D-SMA, which may indicate market weakness worth paying attention to.\n\nSitting just above the 200D-SMA was the Realized Price at $19.7k. Within the world of Bitcoin, this psychological cost basis model is also widely observed. With prices now convincingly above this price model, it indicates that the average BTC holder is back in a net unrealized profit.\n\nTo date, the 2022-23 bear market has spent 179-days below the Realized Price, making it the second longest duration across the last four bear cycles.\n\nThe chart below presents three variants of the Realized Price, split into cohorts:\n\n🔴 Short-Term Holder Realized Price ($18.0k), the average of coins that changed-hands in the last 155-days.\n🟠 Realized Price ($19.7k), being the average of all coin holders.\n🔵 Long-Term Holder Realized Price ($22.4k), the average of coins which have been held for at least 155-days.\n\nThere are several key observations from this model:\n\nThere is a notable similarity in market strength to that observed in April 2019, albeit the current market is yet to breach the LTH-Realized Price.\nIn both the 2018-19 and 2022-23 bear markets, all three realized prices converged, indicating a return to a homogeneous holder base (where the average BTC holder carries an approximately equivalent cost basis, regardless of holding time).\nThe Short-Term Holder Realized Price is lower than the others, reflecting a major capitulation style event after FTX collapsed, indicating a significant volume of coins changed hands afterwards.\n🔔 Alert Idea: Price breaking above $22.4k would reflect a rally above the LTH-Realized Price, putting the average holder in all cohorts back into profit.\nLive Professional Chart\nEstimating Fair Value\n\nThe goal of estimating a fair present, or future value for Bitcoin has been the subject of countless modelling attempts and iterations. One such model was first presented by Willy Woo, and is derived from transaction volumes, and the NVT ratio.\n\nThis model uses a look-back at the last two years of settlement volume, and then derives an estimated 'implied fair value' based on network value throughput. The variant below uses our Change-Adjusted volume, which filters transfers using industry standard heuristics. There are two notable observations over the last 12-months:\n\nThe model greatly over-estimated Bitcoin fair value in 2022. In hindsight, this is likely a result of volumes sourced from large entities undergoing massive deleveraging events, but also with an unfortunate component of wallet (mis)management by the FTX/Alameda entities in their final days.\nThis model has collapsed in line with the huge reduction in transfer volumes covered last week, suggesting a fair value between $8.2k and $10.0k.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nHowever, with the benefit of glassnode's entity-adjustment algorithms, we can achieve a more accurate representation of true economically meaningful transfer volume, and thus derive a much cleaner NVT Price model, with a visibly stronger relationship to price.\n\nThis variant estimates a 'fair value' for Bitcoin between $15.0k and $17.6k based on our best estimate of economical value settled. This is closely aligned with the price range held over the prior month.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nRelief For Miners\n\nOne of the sectors hit the hardest over the last 12-months has been Bitcoin miners. This was especially visible this cycle as publicly traded companies saw major hits to their valuations, and thus stock prices.\n\nThe model below estimates the average cost of BTC production at $18,798, under the assumption that Difficulty reflects the ultimate 'price' of the mining sector.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAn alternative cost of production model equates Difficulty to the rate of coin Issuance, and develops three bands representing:\n\n🔴 The most efficient miners\n🟠 The average miners\n🟣 The least efficient miners.\n\nThe average production cost is estimated to be $17,062, which is similar, but slightly below the model above ($18.8k). Based on both tools, it is likely that miners across the board are seeing more favourable financial conditions ahead, with the market providing some much needed relief (assuming it holds up).\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Price breaking below the $17.0k would reflect a fall back below both cost of production models, which may put the mining sector back into acute financial stress.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTo illustrate this point, the chart below reflects the profitability of the Antminer S19 Pro, released circa May 2020, and until very recently, one of the flagship operational rigs. The colored zones in the chart below reflect estimated profitability levels for this rig under various all-in-sustaining-cost (AISC) assumptions ($/kWh). Note, AISC, not to be confused with ASIC!\n\n🟣 $0.125/kWh\n🟢 $0.100/kWh\n🟡 $0.075/kWh\n🟠 $0.050/kWh\n🔴 $0.025/kWh\n\nWith the chart shown in log-space, periods where this rig is estimated to be unprofitable will show up as gaps in the relevant color plot. Two such periods are clear, being May to Oct 2020 (immediately after the rig release, and halving event), and again from July 2022 until this week. Via this model, the S19 Pro is estimated to have been unprofitable for any miner operating at an AISC over ~$0.10/kWh for the last seven months.\n\n🪟 A suite of metrics related to ASIC rig profitability, power consumption, and revenue output can be found in our live dashboard: Mining ASIC Fleet.\nLive Advanced Chart\nProfits Return\n\nThe final topic of interest is the return of profitable transactions on-chain. The aSOPR model is in the process of retesting a value of 1.0 from below, which has proven to be a key resistance level throughout the bear market.\n\nAn aSOPR break above, and ideally a successful retest of 1.0 has often signalled a meaningful regime shift, as profits are realized, and sufficient demand flows in to absorb them.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: aSOPR (30DMA) breaking above 1.0 indicates a wider-scale return of profitability to transactions, and tends to signal macro market strength.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nA similar observation can be made for the Realized P/L Ratio, which accounts for total USD size on the move. This model is also retesting 1.0 on the underside, providing a first indication that profitable transactions are occurring, and being absorbed by the market.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Realized P/L Ratio (30DMA) breaking above 1.0 indicates a wide-scale return of profitability, and tends to signal macro market strength.\nLive Advanced Chart\nSeeking Confluence\n\nTo close, we have recently released a new Dashboard design, aimed at finding confluence amongst several on-chain metrics, across four core concepts. This model distils key levels and observations, that have historically signalled a robust recovery from a bear market is underway, into an easy to use visual tool.\n\nFor brevity we will not cover the full details in today's edition, but instead recommend reviewing our video guide, and the notes contained within the Dashboard itself (and future reports covering the subject).\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWith an explosive 23.3% rally to start off the year, a wide cross-section of Bitcoin investors (and miners) have seen their net holdings (and operations) return to a profit. This reflects the impact of both strong price appreciation, but also the tremendous volume of coins that changed hands over recent months, resetting their cost basis lower.\n\nWith aSOPR and the Realized P/L Ratio testing a break-even value of 1.0, the test as to whether the market can hold onto these gains becomes the next big question.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Realized volatility for the two major assets has fallen to extreme lows. Such periods have historically preceded explosive market moves, with past examples both cutting asset valuations in half, and triggering new bull markets.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJan 9, 2023 • 9 min read\n\nThe digital asset market has opened the new year...by staying asleep. Since our final newsletter edition on 12-December (WoC 50, 2022), the markets are almost exactly where we left them.\n\nWith that as context, and from the whole Glassnode team, we hope you had a refreshing, and low voilatility break, and welcome you back to the 2023 series of The Week, On-chain.\n\nIn a rarely seen feat, Bitcoin managed to trade within a price range of just $557 for over three weeks, with the highest price ($16.9k) just 3.4% above the range low of $16.4k. The end of year period is typically a quiet one for all markets, and in this instance, the digital asset space was no exception.\n\nIn this first edition of the year, we will cover the following topics:\n\nExtremely low realized volatility, which historically precedes explosive market moves (in both directions), with latest examples of Nov 2018, and Apr-2019.\nSoftness in on-chain activity for BTC and ETH, coincident with low overall market volatility, and setting up weak a baseline for the new year.\nDrawdowns in the Realized Cap indicating 2022 is comfortably one of the deepest bear markets to date with respect to capital losses.\n🪟 View all charts covered in this report in The Week On-chain Dashboard\n\n🔔 Alert Ideas presented in this edition can be set within Glassnode Studio.\n️🏴‍☠️ The Week On-chain is translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\n📽️ Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, or visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nBitcoin markets are infamous for their volatility, however in spite of this, the holiday break was exceptionally quiet. Realized volatility over the last month for BTC declined to multi-year lows of 24.6%, of which there are very few instances with similar levels (marked in 🟦). However, all prior examples preceded much higher volatility environments on the road ahead, with most trading higher, and just one (Nov 2018) trading dramatically lower.\n\nEarly bull market in 2012-13 where BTC prices were between $5 and $14.\nLate bear market in 2015 and at several stages through the bull run 2016.\nNov-2018 immediately preceding a -50% drawdown in 1-month.\nApr-2019 prior to a rally from $4.2k to a peak of $14k in July-2019.\nJul-2020 in the lead up to what became the 2020-21 bull run to $64k.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThere are even fewer historically quiet periods for ETH, which has seen monthly realized volatility collapse to 39.8%. All primary instances of similarly low market volatility also preceded extreme volatility, with Nov-2018 (-58% sell-off) and Jul-2020 (2020-21 bull) being the primary examples.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nA Weak Bitcoin Baseline\n\nShifting our focus into the on-chain activity space, we can see that a short-term burst of Bitcoin new addresses occurred followed the FTX fiasco, but has since cooled off noticeably. The monthly average 🔴 of New Addresses is returning towards the yearly average baseline 🔵, indicating that network usage is yet to establish a convincing and sustained recovery.\n\nThe momentum of on-chain activity metrics is a powerful tool to monitor a recovery in network fundamentals, with the 2019-20 period being a key example from the past.\n\n🗜️ Workbench Tip: There are several similar momentum indicators available as Workbench Constructions, listed under Economic Indicators\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: New Addresses (30D-SMA) breaking below 405k/day could signal a deterioration in on-chain activity, and a flip back towards negative momentum.\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nDespite this short burst of address activity, the total USD value processed by the Bitcoin network has been in free-fall. Daily transfer volume has collapsed from the ~$40B heights in Q3-2022, to just $5.8B/day today.\n\nThis returns daily settlement volumes to pre-bull 2020 levels, and largely indicates an expulsion of institutional sized capital flowing across the network.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nWe can see this in the relative breakdown of transfer volume, where the dominance of $10M+ sized transactions has been a primary contributor to this decline. Large size transfers have fallen from 42.8% dominance prior to the FTX collapse, to just 19.0% today.\n\nThis suggests a significant lull in institutional sized capital flows, and perhaps a serious shaking of confidence occurring amongst this cohort. It may also reflect, in part, and sadly, an expulsion of the questionable capital flows associated with the FTX/Alameda entities.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nDemand for Bitcoin blockspace continues to remain weak, with negligible upwards pressure on the Bitcoin fee market. The 4-yr Z-Score of miner revenues is yet to make any noteworthy progress back towards positive territory, and remains -0.67 standard deviations below the mean.\n\n🗜️ Workbench Tip: This chart uses a 4-year Z-Score, taking advantage of the moving average sma(m1,1460) and standard deviation std(m1,1460) functions.\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nThis quiet on-chain activity can also be seen in the compressing USD denominated exchange flows for both BTC and ETH. The chart below presents Inflows (+ve) and Outflows (-ve) for Bitcoin 🟠 and Ether 🔵 related to exchange entities we monitor.\n\nBitcoin inflow volumes are currently between $350M and $400M/day, which are a far cry from the multi-billion dollar levels seen throughout in 2021-22. Also of note is the expanded scale of ETH exchange flows, which have grown from just 30% dominance up to May-2021, to 42% today. Note ETH dominance here considers the total USD exchange flows (in and out), and calculated as ETH / (BTC+ETH).\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nEthereum Remains Quiet\n\nThe Bitcoin network is not alone in experiencing this extremely light on-chain utilization, with the average gas price paid on the Ethereum chain remaining near cycle lows. The mean gas price since September has ranged between 16 and 23 Gwei, levels last seen during in the June-July 2021 consolidation, and in May 2020 shortly after the COVID market panic.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Mean Gas Price (7D-SMA) breaking above 30 GWEI could signal an increase in on-chain activity, suggesting greater demand for Ethereum blockspace.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nBreaking down gas consumption by sector, we can see that several domains are declining in their relative gas consumption dominance: MEV bots, Bridges, DeFi protocols, and ERC-20 tokens. Between Sept-2020 and Sept-2021, these four sectors represented a combined 45.5% of gas consumption, with DeFi protocols commanding the majority of this.\n\nToday however, these four sectors represent for less than half of their peak dominance, and account for 22.6% of network gas consumption.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe sector which has seen a recent influx of activity and attention are NFTs, which dominated gas consumption throughout 2022, and have recently increased from 13% to 22% dominance.\n\nBy and large, the leading NFT markets and projects have maintained a primary foothold on the Ethereum main-chain, and as yet, there has not been a notable migration of existing NFTs towards bridges and other chains. This is potentially a result of several high profile bridge hacks throughout 2022, as well as lower gas fees on main-chain at present.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nA Realized Drawdown\n\nThe Realized Cap remains one of the most important metrics in on-chain analysis, providing an elegant tool to monitor capital inflows and outflows from digital assets. The underlying assumption being that when coins transact, their value is pricestamped, and thus avoids valuing long lost coins (like Satoshi's) at the spot price, as it is via Market Cap.\n\nWhilst not perfect, the Realized Cap is arguably one of the better tools available to measure true capital inflows, to compare valuations between assets. It acts to both filter out lost coins, partially account for volume churn (where the same coins constantly transact), and better reflects the true invested value by the market.\n\nWith this as context, the Bitcoin Realized Cap has declined by -18.8% since the ATH, representing a net capital outflow of -$88.4B from the network. This makes for the second largest relative decline in history, and the largest in terms of USD realized losses. This resets the Realized cap to May 2021 levels, expelling all invested value throughout the second peak of H2-2021.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe Ethereum Realized Cap has drawndown by an even larger relative scale, declining by -29.2% since the ATH set in Jan-2022. Ether investors have locked in a total of -$67.1B in net realized losses over the course of 2022.\n\nThis also puts the prevailing bear market as the worst in history on a USD denominated realized loss basis, but not yet on a relative scale, eclipsed by the 2018-19 bear market at a 35.8% drawdown.\n\n🗜️ Workbench Tip: Both of these drawdown metrics are built using the cummax(m1) function, which models the all-time-high of metric m1 (example).\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nFinally, we close with a new interpretation of market dominance, aimed at addressing some of the aforementioned shortcomings associated with Market Cap dominance. The principle issue with the widely used 'Bitcoin dominance' metric is that the market cap of relatively illiquid tokens are prone to manipulation (such as FTT and others supported by the FTX entity). As such, entities with large and often illiquid stakes can support inflated valuations on paper, but which diverge significantly from underlying market realities.\n\nThe model below presents the simplest implementation of Realized Cap Dominance, which is a counterpart to the the more traditional Market Cap Dominance. It is designed to track the relative structural capital inflow/outflows across the two major and most liquid digital assets, BTC and ETH.\n\nThis tool, and principle can be applied to any basket of coins and tokens to track structural changes in dominance, better reflecting real capital flows, and discounting illiquid supply (such as un-vested token allocations, protocol treasuries, or lost supply).\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe 2022-23 holiday period has been historically quiet, and it is rare for such conditions to stick around for long. Past occasions where BTC and ETH volatility was this low have preceded extremely volatile market environments, with past examples trading both higher and lower.\n\nOn-chain activity for the two majors remains extremely weak, despite a short-term bump following FTX. Using both on-chain activity, and realized cap drawdowns, it is safe to say that the excesses of H2-2021 has been largely expelled from the system. This process has been painful for investors, however has brought market valuations closer to their underlying fundamentals.\n\nThank you for returning as a reader of The Week On-chain, and we look forward to documenting all that 2023 holds in store for us.\n\nand educationalDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\n2022 The Year On-chain\n\nAs the chaotic, volatile, and financially brutal year of 2022 comes to a close, we explore the state of play across Bitcoin, Ethereum and stablecoin markets. This year in review will be the final edition for the year, and we look forward to returning for an exciting 2023.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nDec 12, 2022 • 10 min read\n\n2022 has been one of the most chaotic, volatile, and financially brutal years, not only for the digital asset industry, but also for wider financial markets. With central bank monetary policy performing a 180 degree U-turn, and following decades of extremely loose and easy credit conditions, tightening conditions have caused severe and rapid drawdowns across most asset classes.\n\nThis edition of The Week On-chain will be our final one for the year (unless a major industry moving event inspires us for an encore). As such, we will provide a high level overview of the year that was, and where we are in the setup for 2023. In this piece we will cover:\n\nVolatility, Derivatives, and Futures leverage.\nThe severity of realized losses over the last year.\nBitcoin on-chain supply structure and concentrations.\nCooling off in the Bitcoin mining sector.\nEthereum post-Merge supply dynamics.\nEvolving trends in Ethereum gas consumption dominance.\nShifting trends and dominance in Stablecoin markets.\nFrom the Glassnode team: To all readers of The Week On-chain, and to Glassnode members, we want to thank you all for your support and readership this year. We certainly hope you enjoyed reading the WoC, and using Glassnode tools, as much as we enjoy writing and building them.\n\nWe wish you all the very best over the holiday season, and look forward to another exciting year in 2023.\nA Quiet Future\n\nAfter what has been a truly chaotic year, the Bitcoin market has turned very quiet coming into December. Short-term realized volatility for BTC is currently at multi-year lows of 22% (1-week), and 28% (2-weeks), making for the lowest volatility regime since Oct 2020.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nFutures volumes are similarly depressed, now probing multi-year lows. Both BTC and ETH markets are currently trading similar volumes between $9.5B and $10.5B per day. This shows the massive impact of tightening liquidity, widespread deleveraging, and the impairment of many lending and trading desks in the space.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nOpen Interest in futures markets has pulled back significantly following the FTX implosion. The chart below shows the Leverage Ratio, calculated as the ratio between Futures Open Interest, and the corresponding asset market cap.\n\nThe build up, and unwind of futures leverage in November has been notably more severe for ETH, likely a result of residual 'Merge trades' being closed out. ETH open interest has fallen from 4.75%, to 3.10% of the Market cap. The BTC leverage ratio peaked a week before ETH markets, and has since declined from 3.46% to 2.50% of the market cap over the last month.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nBoth Bitcoin calendar futures and perpetual swaps are trading in a state of backwardation, with an annualized basis of -0.3%, and -2.5% respectively. Sustained periods of backwardation are uncommon, with the only similar period being the consolidation between May and July 2021. This suggests the market is relatively 'hedged' for further downside risk, and/or heavier with short speculators.\n\nLive Dashboard\nGiving Back to the Market\n\nThe excess liquidity bubble from the loose monetary policy era in 2020-21 created a record yearly total realized profit on-chain. Over $455 Billion in yearly profits were taken by Bitcoin investors moving funds on-chain, with the peak hit soon after the Nov 2021 ATH.\n\nSince then, a bear market regime has dominated, and the market has given back over $213 Billion in realized losses. This equates to 46.8% of the 2020-21 bull profits, which is very similar in relative magnitude to the 2018 bear, where the market gave back 47.9%.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nOf note is the contribution of Long-Term Holders, whom in this cycle realized two of the largest relative loss spikes in history. Through November, LTH losses peaked at -0.10% of the Market Cap per day, comparable in scale only to the 2015 and 2018 cycle lows. The sell-off in June is similarly impressive at -0.09% of the Market Cap per day, with heavy dominance of LTHs locking in -50% to -80% losses.\n\nAvailable in the Engine Room for Professionals\nTaking a Long-Term View\n\nDespite these spectacularly large losses, the age of the coin supply, and propensity for HODLing by those who remain continues to rise. Long-Term Holder Supply has completely reverted the panic spending after the FTX fiasco, hitting a new ATH of 13.908M BTC (72.3% of circulating supply).\n\nThe near linear uptrend in this metric is a reflection of the heavy coin accumulation that occurred in June and July 2022, immediately after the deleveraging event inspired by 3AC and failing lenders in the space.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThe chart below provides a view into the density and distribution of the coin-supply, colored by age bands.\n\nWarm colours indicate a heavy distribution by older coins, typically seen at market tops, and capitulation bottoms.\nCooler colors indicate maturation, as investors accumulate and leave coins unspent.\nDarker bars indicate heavier coin density (and vice-versa for lighter bars).\n\nAfter each market leg down in 2022, we can see density of coin re-distribution (and thus re-accumulation) has increased. In particular, the June to October 2022 zone stands out, with many coins acquired between $18k and $24k, which are now ageing into the 6-month+ band (hence the rising LTH Supply above).\n\nAvailable in the Engine Room for Professionals\nA Hard Time for Miners\n\nLast week saw the largest downwards difficulty adjustment since the Great Mining Migration in July 2021. Difficulty declined by 7.32%, signifying a reasonably large portion of the active hashrate was switched off, likely a result of continued income stress.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAs a result, the hash-ribbons have inverted once again, with the cross-over occurring in late-Nov. This signifies that there is sufficient stress in the mining industry that some operators are taking ASIC rigs offline. This is typically associated with the miners income stream falling below their OPEX expense, making the rigs unprofitable.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThis doesn't come as too much of a surprise however, given that hash-price is only barely above all-time-lows. Despite spot prices (~$17k) being 70% higher than they were in October 2020 (~$10k), the amount of hashpower competing to find the next Bitcoin block is now 70% higher.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nAfter the Merge\n\nThe Ethereum Merge, completed on 15-September, was arguably the most impressive engineering feat of the year. To visualise the immediacy of the event, the chart below shows the mean and median block interval over the course of 2022. It is immediately clear where the natural and probablistic variability of Proof-of-Work came to an end, and the precise, pre-determined 12-second blocktime of Proof-of-Stake came into effect.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nSince the Merge, the number of active validators has increased by 13.3%, with over 484k validators now operational. This brings the total ETH staked to 15.618M ETH, which is equivalent to 12.89% of the circulating supply.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nAlong with the transition to Proof-of-Stake, the Ethereum monetary policy was adjusted to a significantly lower emission schedule. The nominal rate of issuance (blue) is around +0.5%, however after factoring in the EIP1559 burn mechanism (red), this is almost entirely offset to around +0.1% on a typical day. This compares to a net inflation rate of +3.9% prior to the Merge, showing just how dramatic the change to issuance has been.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nAt the time of writing, the ETH supply change since the Merge has just turned net deflationary, with the current coin supply now -242 ETH lower than it was on at the Merge. This compares to an estimated 1.044M ETH that would have otherwise been issued into circulation under the previous issuance schedule.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\nWe are Hiring an Ethereum Analyst.\n\nIf you are an analyst who specializes in Ethereum, DeFi, and associated ecosystems (or know someone who is), please get in touch. We are looking for a senior Ethereum analyst to join our team, and pioneer and advance the field of on-chain analytics across this ever evolving ecosystem.\n\nDeFi Deleverages\n\nWith such an extreme drawdown in token prices, and a severe contraction of liquidity, the total value locked in DeFi has fallen dramatically. After hitting a peak of $160B at the market ATH in Nov 2021, DeFi TVL has dropped by over $120.3B (-75%). This brings DeFi collateral values down to $39.7B, returning to Feb 2021 levels.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe dominance of gas consumption by transaction type has also demonstrated a shifting market preference over the last two years. DeFi protocols commanded between 25% and 30% of all gas consumption from July 2020, until May 2021, but have since fallen to just 14%.\n\nIn a similar boom-bust cycle, NFT related transactions accounted for 20% to 38% of gas usage through H1 2022, but have now also fallen to 14% dominance. Stablecoins have held a steady 5% to 6% dominance throughout this year.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\nStablecoin Outflows\n\nStablecoins have become a cornerstone asset of the industry since 2020, with 3 of the top 6 assets by market cap now being stablecoins. Total stablecoin supply peaked at $161.5B in March 2022, however has since seen large scale redemptions exceeding $14.3B.\n\nOverall this reflects a net capital outflows from the space of between -$4B and $-8B per month. However, is also notable that this reflects just 8% of the peak stablecoin supply, suggesting a majority of this capital still remains in this new digital dollar format.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nThere have also been notable shifts taking place in relative stablecoin supply dominance.\n\nBUSD stands out, having increased its market share from 10% to 16% in 2022, and now representing $22.0B in total asset value.\nTether has maintained a relatively consistent 45% to 50% market share, despite a total of $18.42B in USDT redemption since May.\nUSDC dominance peaked at 38% in June, but has since fallen to 31.3%, now accounting for $44.75B in value.\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nWhilst stablecoins are currently experiencing redemptions, and capital outflows on net, transfer volumes on Ethereum have continued to climb throughout H2 2022. Aggregate transfer volumes for stablecoins were stable at around $16B per day through much of 2021-22, but have continued to climb to between $20B and $30B per day since July.\n\nDuring the high volatility sell-off events in May, June, and November, total stablecoin transfer volumes peak between $37B and $51B, suggesting an extreme demand for USD liquidity during deleveraging events.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThis year has seen both BTC and ETH reach drawdowns exceed -75% off the all-time-high set in November. Since May, this has been punctuated by a wide-scale, and massive deleveraging event. This resulted in significant credit contraction, numerous bankruptcies, the unfortunate collapse of multi-billion dollar ponzi project (LUNA-UST), and sadly what appears to be fraud in the case of FTX.\n\n2022 was a brutal year, and it has driven volatility and volumes to multi-year lows, as liquidity and speculative dries up. With speculators gone, Bitcoin Long-term Holder supply has pushed to yet another ATH, and investors appear to be stepping in with increasing coin volume on each price leg down. The Ethereum Merge was also executed successfully in September, and stablecoins continue to demonstrate a meaningful product market fit.\n\nThe resilience of decentralized systems is built through many years of trials, and battle scars, however these events are ultimately what forges the HODLer cohort, the buyers of last resort. After all the challenegs of 2022, the digital asset industry still stands, lessons are learned, and Bitcoin blocks keep being found.\n\nIrrespective of what comes in 2023, we believe this industry will stand the test of time, and we will keep building the tools and data needed to analyze, study, and understand why.\n\nTick tock, next block, and we will see you in 2023.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Capital Reset\n\nIn the wake of one of the largest deleveraging events in digital asset history, the Bitcoin Realized Cap has declined such that all capital inflows since May 2021, have now been flushed out. There is an associated uptick in on-chain activity, however it lacks substantial volume follow through.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nDec 5, 2022 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has seen considerable consolidation above cycle lows following a tempestuous few weeks in the wake of the FTX implosion. Price action has seen a strong recovery of near 10%, bouncing from range lows of $16,065 to a high of $17,197.\n\nIn this weeks edition, we shall explore the severity of losses experienced by market participants in what appears to be the largest deleverging event in digital asset history. We will also explore the subsequent effects on both network activity and and demand for blockspace, and what it tells us about current market structure.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nA Regime of Loss\n\nTo begin our assessment, we shall inspect the magnitude of losses realized by all market participants throughout the turbulent deleveraging event in recent weeks.\n\nBoth the June 2022 sell-off, and the FTX Implosion prompted investor capitulation events that are of historical scale. The FTX event recorded an ATH one-day loss of -$4.435B.  However, when assessed with a weekly moving average, losses appear to be subsiding. The June Sell-off by comparison sustained over -$700M in losses each day for almost 2 weeks after the event.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nWe can supplement this analysis by inspecting the ratio between realized profit , and realized loss. Here we can observe that the ratio between realized profit / loss has recorded a new all time low.\n\nThis indicates that losses locked in by the market were 14x larger than profit taking events. It is likely this in part reflects how the entirety of the 2020-22 cycle price action is above the spot price.\n\nPrevious instances of extremely low Realized Profit/Loss ratios at this scale have historically coincided with a macro market regime shift.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nNext, we shall inspect the Realized Capitalization metric, which displays the the net sum of capital inflows, and outflow into the network since inception. We can use this metric to assess the severity of capital outflows from the network after the market cycle peak.\n\nA significant rise can be seen in the Realized Cap following the sell-off in mid-2021. This can be interpreted as market participants taking significant exit liquidity on the rally higher, and thus realizing profits, and increasing the Realized Cap.\n\nFollowing the LUNA collapse in May 2022, a significant capital outflow can be seen, as investors who purchased near the market top started locking in increasingly large losses.\n\nThe exuberance experienced during the H2 2022 rally to the ATH has almost fully retraced, suggesting a near complete detox of this excess liquidity.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can then compare the current cycle to all previous major bear markets, measuring from Realized Cap peak, to trough, as a gauge for relative capital outflows:\n\nThe 2010-11 saw a net capital outflow equivalent 24% of the peak.\nThe 2014-15 experienced the lowest, yet a non-trivial capital outflow of 14%.\nThe 2017-18 recorded a 16.5% decline in Realized Cap, the closest to the current cycle of 17.0%.\n\nBy this measure, the current cycle has seen the third largest relative outflow of capital, and has now eclipsed the 2018 cycle, which is arguably the most relevant mature market analogue.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nThe realized loss experienced by Bitcoin investors across the past 6 months has been historic in magnitude. Profitability stress is starting to diminish after the event, but has resulted in a complete flush out of all excess liquidity attracted over the last 18-months. This suggests that a complete expulsion of 2021 speculative premium has now occurred.\nAn Uptick in Blockspace Demand\n\nThe Miner Revenue from Fees metric allows for insight into the demand for blockspace, and whether transactors are willing to bid up fees paid for inclusion in the next block. If we compare the monthly fee rate to the longer standing yearly average, we can assess the local fee momentum.\n\nFee Momentum above 1 🔵 suggests an expansion in miner revenue contribution from fees, relative to the yearly baseline.\nFee Momentum below 1 🔴indicates a contraction in miner revenue from fees relative to the yearly baseline.\n\nSustained bear markets are often accompanied by a significant decline in network activity, resulting in fairly lacklustre fee revenue. This deadlock has historically broken in reaction to a major capitulation in price action, where substantially lower prices entices new demand for blockspace. As sellers are expelled, and value buyers take the other side, this excitement creates an uptick in network congestion.\n\nOf most interest is whether this uptick is fleeting, or whether it can be sustained, signifying a potential regime shift is underway.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThis observation is supported by the the Active Entities Momentum metric, which can be considered under the following framework.\n\nMomentum above 1 🔵 indicates expansion in unique entity activity.\nMomentum below 1 🔴 suggests contraction in unique entity activity.\n\nAgain, we note that the recent price drawdown has stimulated an influx of activity on-chain, with this metric breaching above the equilibrium position for the first time since the price rally to $48k in April 2022.\n\nIt would be encouraging to see Entity Momentum remain at elevated levels relative to the equilibrium threshold.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nFollowing on, we introduce a set of yearly rolling standard deviation bands for the Transaction count metric (on Entity-Adjusted basis). This plots out the 14D-SMA for all confirmed transactions, as well as a series of statistical bands within the range of ± 2σ.\n\nTwo key observations can be ascertained:\n\nThe dramatic decline in Transaction Count in May 2021 exemplifies a near total expulsion of network activity, similar to that seen in early 2018.\nFollowing the aforementioned event, network activity embarked on a slow, but consistent recovery towards the yearly baseline. This is again similar to late 2018, and much of 2019\n\nThe stabilization of Transaction Counts shows that over the course of the last 6-months, the Bitcoin network has been approaching and oscillating around an equilibrium position of demand for blockspace.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nOne area which continues to languish is the settlement of volume across the network.\n\nThe current volume settled is testing cycle lows, suggesting the utilization of the network for value transfer remains lacklustre, despite improvements in transaction counts, and unique entities.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWith transaction counts recovering, but transfer volumes declining, it is likely a reflection of more small size transfers, and declining dominance of larger institutional sized entities. The Relative Transfer Volume Breakdown confirms this, showing the dominance of smaller sized transactions (up to $100k) has increased to around 35%. This is a break from the relatively stable 10% to 12% through the entirety of the 2020-22 cycle.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThis can be further critiqued using the RVT Ratio metric shows that the network is near peak under-utilization. This suggests that even after the a significant capital outflow detailed above, the Bitcoin Realized Cap is still relatively high compared to transfer volume.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nThere are some constructive improvements in Bitcoin network activity and demand for blockspace. However, this trend remains in its infancy, and lacks the follow-through of transfer volume, which is again approaching cycle lows.\nAs Above, So Below\n\nDespite improving participant activity, utilization of the network remains lacklustre, and it is prudent to prepare for all possibilities. We consult two on-chain pricing models which reflect network cost basis, and have been visited in prior bear cycles:\n\nThe Balanced Price 🔵 is calculated as the difference between Realized Price and Transfer Price. The Transfer Price is the cumulative sum of Coin Days Destroyed in USD, adjusted by circulating supply and total time since Bitcoin's inception.\nThe Delta Price 🟣 is the difference between Realized Cap and Average Cap, divided by the Circulating Supply, where Average Price is assumed to be the life-to-date moving average of Market Price.\n\nIn all prior bear markets, price has traded between the Balanced Price and the Delta Price, with 136-of-4518 (3.0%) of trading days within this range.\n\nWith regards to our current market, this creates a range between $15.5k and $12.0k. Price has only entered this channel briefly during the onset of the FTX collapse, before finding support above the Delta Price.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWhen considering direct overhead resistance, we consult the on-chain cost-basis of the wider market, as well as two granular subsets; the Short and Long-Term Holders.\n\nThe STH cost basis remains has dived significantly lower of late, indicative of the large volume of coins that changed hands in November. We can also note that all on-chain cost-basis are tightly concentrated within the $18.7k to $22.9k range.\n\nThis tight concentration of cost-basis suggests a degree of homogeneity amongst market participants acquisition price. As such, it is more likely that the aggregate market will start to behave in a more cohesive manner in response to volatility. This also suggests that the perceived risk, and  opportunity amongst all participants, old or new, is similar, providing further confluence of a significant full market detox.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that the level of realized financial pain across Bitcoin market participants throughout the last 6 months has been nothing short of staggering, however, the severity of losses do appear to be diminishing over recent weeks.\n\nWe can also note a positive shift in character for both network activity and the demand for blockspace. This shift in structure is not however supported by rising transfer volumes, which continue to languish at cycle lows, and suggest an elevated level of retail sized participation.\n\nA rare, but informative market structure is also present, whereby there is a degree of homogeneity amongst acquisition prices across all Bitcoin cohorts. This allows market analysts to assess the entire Bitcoin market as having a similar perception of risk vs opportunity, and a similar stance with regard to their profitability.\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Character of Capitulation\n\nAs the dust settles after the FTX debacle, a key question is whether the sell-off can be better characterized as a simple continuation of the bearish trend, or instead a trigger of a deeper psychological shift amongst investors.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nNov 28, 2022 • 7 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has continued to consolidate after a chaotic few weeks, with prices trading within a narrow range, holding just above $16k. As the dust settles following the collapse of FTX, the aggregate response of Bitcoin holders is slowly becoming clearer. A key question is whether the recent sell-off can be better characterized as simply a continuation of the bearish trend, or perhaps a trigger of a deeper psychological shift amongst investors.\n\nIn this week's edition, we will explore the scale of both realized and unrealized losses amongst Bitcoin holders, in what is now one of the heaviest capitulation events in history. We shall also analyze the shifting behavioral trends which have occurred since the event, and what this tells us about the bigger picture, and the subsequent effects on investor resolve, and seller exhaustion.\n\nA Behavioral Shift\n\nThe price of BTC has been trading below the Realized Price ( the cost-basis of the wider market) for over 4.5 months. This has historically correlated with the bottom discovery phase, which can often be visualized and assessed using the Accumulation Trend Score metric.\n\nThis tool indicates the relative balance change of entities over the last 30 days, with the scale representing both the size of the balance change and its direction (accumulation to distribution).\n\nValues approaching 1 🟣 signify that a large portion of the Bitcoin network has been accumulating coins and meaningfully increasing their balance.\nValues approaching 0 🟡 signify that a large portion of the Bitcoin network has been distributing coins and meaningfully decreasing their balance.\n\nFrom a comparative point of view, the recent strong accumulation score following the recent sell-off resembles that of late 2018. This behavioral shift can be seen immediately following many major sell-off events, including:\n\nNovember -December 2018 50% sell-off\nMarch 2020 COVID Crash\nMay 2022 LUNA collapse\nJune 2022, when the price first fell below $20k\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can break down which specific entities are participating by leveraging the Accumulation 🟦 (and Distribution 🟥) Trend Scores by wallet cohort.\n\nInspecting the following chart illustrates that almost all cohorts have shifted towards accumulation 🟦 after the recent price contraction. This is a signal of both a perceived opportunity to buy but also a widespread move of coins away from exchanges and towards self-custody (as discussed in WoC 46).\n\nA similar period of widespread accumulation can be observed after all aforementioned sell-off events.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nMore detailed investigation of various wallet size cohorts can be supplemented with two recently published Glassnode dashboards:\n\nAddress Cohorts (Advanced): showing the total number of addresses and 30-day change of cohort numbers.\nEntities Balance Change (Professional): showing the net holdings and 30-day balance change.\n\nAmong all cohorts, the entities holding < 1 BTC (also labelled as Shrimp 🦐) have recorded two distinctive ATH waves of balance increase over the last 5-months. Shrimps have added +96.2k BTC to their holdings since the collapse of FTX, and now hold over 1.21M BTC, equivalent to a non-trivial 6.3% of the circulating supply.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nNew Investors Under Pressure\n\nOne consistent event which motivates the transition from a bear back towards a bull market is the dramatic realization of losses, as investors give up and capitulate at scale. November has seen the fourth largest capitulation event on record, recording a 7-day realized loss of -$10.16B. This is 4.0x larger than the peak in Dec 2018, and 2.2x larger than March 2020.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThis financial stress can also be examined from the perspective of newer investors. By observing the relationship between the cost basis of Short-Term Holders and the Spot Price, the following pattern can be observed throughout Bitcoin cycles.\n\nBull Market 🟦: As price appreciates, the average acquisition price of newly purchased supply is consistently in profit (STH-Cost Basis < Spot Price)\nBear Market 🟥: Steady price depreciation results in the new investors' cost basis being above spot prices (STH-Cost Basis > Spot Price)\n\nWith the STH-Cost Basis currently at $18.83k, the average recent buyer is underwater by -12%.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nFurther analysis of the STH cost-basis during bear markets can therefore produce a compass for tracing the transition phase to bull markets.\n\nPre-Bottom Discovery (A) 🟦: Throughout the early stages of a bear market, the aggregated cost basis of all investors remains well below the spot price, as most investors remain profitable (Spot Price > Realized Price).\nBottom Discovery (B) 🟧: after an extended bearish trend, eventually, the market reaches complete capitulation, and the spot price falls below the Realized Price.\nFloor Discovery (C) 🟥: As the market experiences a significant sell-off, and sellers approach exhaustion, heavy distribution is met with equal accumulation by others. This drives the STH Cost Basis below the Realized Price, signifying recent buyers have a superior entry to the average holder.\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nIn the aftermath of FTX price action, this final description of market structure has occurred 🟥, signalling a very significant volume of coins have now changed hands, at substantially discounted prices.\n\nWe can also quantify the size of the Unrealized Loss relative to the market size. Relative Unrealized Loss measures the aggregated loss still held by the wider market, compared to the total market capitalization.\n\nTracking the weekly average of this indicator shows that at extreme points of prior bear markets, investors were shouldering a loss in excess of 50% of total market cap at the time. This metric has recently peaked at 56%, which is the highest for this cycle, and comparable to prior bear market floors.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nPeak Under-performance\n\nThe Adjusted MVRV Ratio is a tool which discounts the profit held in dormant or lost supply (coins unmoved for > 7yrs). Values above 1 indicate that the ‘Active Market’ is in aggregate profit, whilst values below 1 denote the market is underwater.\n\nThis metric is currently returning a value of 0.63 (average unrealized loss of 37%), which is very significant since only 1.57% of trading days in bitcoin history have recorded a lower Adjusted MVRV value. In other words, if we discount profit held across the presumably lost supply, the current market is the most underwater it has been since the near pico-bottom set in Dec 2018 and Jan 2015.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nNot only is the unrealized loss still held in the market historically large, the realized losses have also been historic in magnitude. Here we use the aSOPR metric, which measures the average spending-to-acquisition price for all coins that moved today. Therefore, values above 1 signal dominant profitability, while values below 1 indicate an aggregate loss.\n\nThe chart below compares the weekly average of aSOPR 🔵 against the High🟢 and Low 🔴 bands that reflect a 2-standard deviation move in aSOPR.\n\nThe recent market reaction to the FTX sell-off manifested as an aSOPR reading which broke below the low band for the first time since March 2020. The significance of this event is again only comparable with the COVID crash, and the capitulation of the market in December 2018.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe chart below shows the 7-day Cumulative Net Realized Profit/Loss, denominated in BTC for comparison between cycles. Remarkably, over the last week, the market realized a net loss equal to -521k BTC, which is again close to the all-time largest recorded in history.\n\nComparing the current Cumulative Net Realized Loss to the COVID and LUNA Crash, with 44% and 39% price decline respectively, the market has shown a larger degree of strength during the recent capitulation with only 26% correction.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe FTX fallout has triggered one of the largest capitulation events in Bitcoin history, flushing billions of USD value out of underwater investors. The market remains in a degree of stasis, likely needing time to fully digest recent volatility.\n\nHowever, the characteristics of this capitulation bear several similarities to the darkest points during the 2018 bear market. This sell-off saw significant statistical deviations outside the mean on investor losses. The current unrealized loss held by the actively traded coin supply is effectively at an all-time-low, rivaling only the very pico-bottoms of the 2015 and 2018 bear cycles.\n\nWith such a chaotic year to date, the resolve of Bitcoin holders has been firmly tested to a historic degree throughout 2022. So much so there are barely any precedents. Those few analogues that exist in Bitcoin history, albeit small in sample size, turned out in hindsight to be the points of absolute seller exhaustion.\n\nTranslated channels\n\nWe are proud to have launched new social channels for:\n\nSpanish (Analyst: @ElCableR, Telegram, Twitter)\nPortuguese (Analyst: @pins_cripto, Telegram, Twitter)\nTurkish (Analyst: @wkriptoofficial, Telegram, Twitter)\nFarsi (Analyst: @CryptoVizArt, Telegram, Twitter)\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics, dashboards, and alerts, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

The market continues to consolidate this week, however did trade down from the early-week high of $17,036, to close at $16,248, one of the lowest closing prices of the cycle.\n\nIn this edition we will zoom into three specific topics, with the goal of assessing how much of a hit Bitcoin investor conviction has taken in the wake of the FTX collapse:\n\nExchange outflows, which have continue to break historical records.\nWhales who are more than likely underwater on their position in aggregate.\nLong-term holders, whom are currently spending coins at a historically significant rate.\n⚡Cyber Week Deal: 40% Off Advanced Plans⚡\n\nStarting today, you can take advantage of our first-ever end of year sale!

This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nCoins Flood Out of Exchanges\n\nAs we covered in last weeks edition, outflows from exchanges and into investor wallets of almost all sizes have been historical in scale, as BTC holders seek safety in self-custody. As a result, the 30-day net position change of all exchange balances has reached a new all-time-high for outflows this week.\n\nBTC is currently flowing out of exchanges at a rate of -172.7k BTC per month, eclipsing the previous peak set following the June 2022 sell-off.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTotal confirmed transactions have also seen an uptick over the last two weeks, reaching a multi-month high of 246k confirmed transactions per day. Out of this total, around 29.2% were related exchange withdrawal transfers (77.1k withdrawals), and 18.2% were exchange deposits transfers (48.1k deposits).\n\nThis burst of exchange related activity pushes the dominance of exchange deposit or withdrawal transactions to 47.4% of the toal, the highest level year-to-date. Historically, higher exchange dominance can be associated with bull markets (sustained trends), and high volatility sell-off events (short-term spikes).\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nOn a 30-day moving average basis, the combined USD denominated inflow and outflow volumes across all exchanges spiked higher, reaching $1.72B/day this week. The chart below presents this monthly average 🔴 relative to the yearly average 🔵 as a gauge for overall momentum of the Bitcoin economy.\n\nHistorically, periods where the monthly average of exchange volumes exceeds the yearly has signalled positive market momentum, as more coin volume changes hands. In the current market, the combined exchange inflow and outflow volume would have to reach and sustain levels above $2.15B to signify positive momentum on this front.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\nWhales Underwater\n\nA trend which can be observed during the later stages of the 2018-19 bear market is an aggregate increase in the Mean Inflow Volume to exchanges. In other words, the average deposit size across all major exchanges increases in USD terms as the market formed a cycle bottom. This is present across all major exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex, Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken.\n\nA similar trend has been in effect since late May following the collapse of the LUNA-UST project. This indicates that in general, there has been a net increase in larger size deposits over the last 6-months. This indicates that entities such as whales, institutions, and trading firms have had a larger dominance across exchange deposits.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nA driving factor of this may be the financial position of Whales (entities > 1k BTC). The yellow trace below shows the average withdrawal price of the Whale cohort since 5-Jul-2017 (launch of Binance), which is trading at $17,825.\n\nWith spot prices currently at $16.2k, this is the the first time since March 2020 that this Whale cohort has been at an unrealized loss. In response, Whales have actually been depositing coins to exchanges, with an excess of between 5k and 7k BTC per day in net inflows over the past week.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nThis magnitude of financial pain is being expressed across the wider market, with one of the largest spikes in Realized Loss in the 2020-22 cycle. A peak daily value of -$1.45B in realized loss was locked in this week, ranking as the fourth largest in history.\n\nA comparably small $83M in realized profits occurred, suggesting that the vast majority of spent volume at present is sourced from investors from the current cycle, and very little coin volume from previous cycles are on the move.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\nOld Hands Awaken\n\nA pattern of interest we highlighted in our last edition was the uptick in spending by Bitcoin longer-term holders. During bear markets, significant and sustained upticks in old coin spending is often a signal of reduced conviction, fear, and capitulation amongst this more experienced cohort.\n\nThe Spent Volume Age Bands (SVAB) metric shows that just over 4% of all spent volume was sourced from coins older than 3-months this week, which is the highest level in 2022. This relative magnitude is coincident with some of the largest in history, often seen during capitulation events and wide scale panic events.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nThe spent BTC volume older than 6-months has hit also the fifth highest value over the last five years. Over 130.6k BTC aged 6-months or more were spent on 17-Nov alone, with the 7-day average now at 50.1k BTC per day.\n\nThis suggests that there is significant uncertainty, which is prompting the changing of hands, and or shuffling of coins by longer-term investors.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nIn the time since FTX collapsed, a total of 254k BTC older than 6-months have been spent, equivalent to around 1.3% of the circulating supply. On a 30-day change basis, this is the steepest decline in older coin supply since the Jan 2021 bull run, where long-term investors were taking profits in the bull market.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nThe average age per spent coin can be measured via the Dormancy metric, which has also seen a significant uptick over recent weeks. Two traces are show below, for different variants of Dormancy:\n\n🔵 Dormancy: which has rallied to 44-days, and presents the average age per spent coin across the whole market.\n🔴 Entity-Adjusted Dormancy: has similarly rallied, hitting 78-days. This variant reflects filtered data that removes self-spends and internal wallet reshuffling.\n\nWhen both metrics experience a similar spike higher, it provides confidence that a meaningful portion of the spending taking place is related to coins changing hands, and less so to internal wallet shuffling. Thus it appears that even Bitcoin long-term holders have been spooked by recent events, and a sub-set of them are spending coins and divesting in response.\n\nLive Advanced Dashboard\n\nFinally, we will inspect the behavior of Long-Term Holders, which accounts for the entities that are statistically the least likely to spend in the face of volatility. Their supply has declined by 84,560 BTC post-FTX, which remains one of the most significant declines in the last year. As shown in the chart below, LTH supply declines have exceeded 100k BTC in three back-to-back months through May, June and July this year. This makes the current decline notable, but not the largest, although it is still underway.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nAcross many metrics that describe the behavior of Bitcoin longer-term investors, several are signalling that a non-trivial volume of spending, and divestment is underway. As noted last week, a slow-down and retrace of these metrics would signify this may be a short-term event, however with each passing day that these trends persist, it becomes increasingly plausible that a wider scale reduction in confidence is in play.\n\nThe Whale cohort are in a mode of net distribution at present, sending between 5k and 7k in excess BTC into exchanges. Meanwhile, the flight of coins off exchanges by almost all cohorts is at an all-time high. The whirlwind impact of the FTX collapse continues to play out, and it remains to be seen just how extensive the shake-up to investor confidence has been.\n\nTranslated channels\n\nWe are proud to have launched new social channels for:\n\nSpanish (Analyst: @ElCableR, Telegram, Twitter)\nPortuguese (Analyst: @pins_cripto, Telegram, Twitter)\nTurkish (Analyst: @wkriptoofficial, Telegram, Twitter)\nFarsi (Analyst: @CryptoVizArt, Telegram, Twitter)\n--\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics, dashboards, and alerts, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Fall of FTX\n\nWith the devastating collapse of the FTX exchange, the digital asset industry has experienced the most shocking insolvency of a custodian since Mt Gox. In this report, we analyze the FTX bank run, seeking of safety in self-custody, and the response of Bitcoin's strongest hands.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nNov 14, 2022 • 11 min read\n\nThe events which transpired in the digital asset industry, between 6-14 November 2022 are nothing short of remarkable, shocking, and disappointing, to say the least. Within the span of just one week, one of the most popular and high trade volume exchanges, FTX.com;\n\nExperienced a bank run.\nHalted customer withdrawals.\nEntered into failed talks to be acquired by competitor Binance.\nDiscovered to be short between $8B to $10B in customer funds.\nHad exchange wallets allegedly hacked to the tune of ~$500M.\nFiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy alongside sister company FTX US.\nExposed what appears to be malfeasance perpetrated by the Alameda / FTX entity.\n\nSuch an event is a tremendous blow to the industry, leaving millions of customers with trapped funds, damaging many years of constructive industry reputation, and creating new credit contagion risks, many of which likely still remain undetected. The event brings back unfortunate memories of the failure of Mt Gox in 2013, whereby a significant custodian is found to be fractionally reserved.\n\nAmidst this chaos, it is important to remember that the digital asset space is a free market, and this event represents a failure of a trusted centralized entity, not of the underlying cryptographic technology. There are no bail outs for Bitcoin, and the forest fire of an industry wide deleveraging will purge all excess and malfeasance, albeit with significant pain along the way. With a renewed focus on exchange Proof-of-Reserves underway, and a push towards self-custody, the market will heal, recover, and return stronger in the months and years ahead.\n\nIn this weeks report, we will cover:\n\nDetails regarding the bank run on FTX on-chain wallets.\nWider impact on exchange balances and self-custody.\nObservations the impacts to Bitcoin long-term holder conviction.\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nFractional Reserves\n\nThe truth regarding how FTX managed to blow a hole between $8 to $10B in their balance sheet, and lose customer deposits will (hopefully) come to light in time, although much evidence suggests a misappropriation of funds via sister hedge fund Alameda Research. For background information, and analysis on the relationship between Alameda, FTX and Binance, we refer readers to the following sources:\n\nTwitter thread detailing the flow of funds between Alameda, FTX and Binance.\nDashboard with relevant charts showing the lifetime flow of funds between entities.\nVideo report covering these initial findings.\n\nTracking the exchange reserves for FTX has been somewhat of a challenge for many data providers over the years, with our own experience being that FTX utilized a relatively complex peeling chain system for their BTC reserves. In April to May this year, the FTX reserves within our cluster had reached a peak of over 102k BTC. This dramatically declined by 51.3% in late-June.\n\nReserves have since persistently declined until reaching effectively zero during this weeks bank run. As claims of Alameda misappropriating customer deposits come to light, this indicates that the Alameda-FTX entity may have in fact experienced severe balance sheet impairment in May-June following the collapse of LUNA, 3AC, and other lenders.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe supply of ETH held on FTX has also experienced two periods of significant decline:\n\nIn June, where reserves dropped by -576k ETH (-55.2%)\nThis week, falling from 611k ETH to just 2.8k (-99.5%)\n\nSimilar to the Bitcoin balance, this leaves close to no ETH in FTX owned wallets, with the bank run effectively clearing what was left from the balance sheet.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWhen looking to stablecoin reserves, we can  see that aggregate reserves on FTX started to decline significantly from 19-Oct, dropping from $725M, to effectively zero over the following month.\n\nStablecoin balances spiked significantly to a new sustained height after the June sell-off, at a time where BTC and ETH reserves had dropped precipitously. This may add further indication that a degree of balance sheet impairment had occurred at that stage, necessitating a swapping or lending of stablecoins for BTC and/or ETH collateral.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWhilst there remains significant uncertainty regarding what really happened between FTX and Alameda, there remains a growing pool of on-chain data to suggest cracks had formed as far back as May-June. This would leave recent months as being simply a precursor to what was more than likely an inevitable collapse of the exchange.\n\n💡 New Dashboards Released\n\nWe have released tho new dashboards which explore changes in Bitcoin cohort size, and balances as a toolbox to observe investor behaviour. The following charts are sourced from our Entity Balance Change dashboard (T3), and can be supplemented by our Address Cohorts Dashboard (T2).\n\nSafety in Self-Custody\n\nOn an industry wide scale, we have seen a withdrawal of coins from exchanges at a truly historic rate, as holders seek the safety of self-custody. The following charts map out the aggregate balance change of exchanges, investor wallet cohorts, and miners since the 6-Nov, when rumblings of troubles at FTX were still in their infancy.\n\nExchanges have seen one of the largest net declines in aggregate BTC balance in history, falling by 72.9k BTC in 7-days. This compares with only three periods in the past; Apr-2020, Nov-2020, and June to July 2022.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nA similar observation can be made for Ether, with 1.101M ETH being withdrawn from exchanges over the last week. This makes for the largest 30-day balance decline since September 2020 during the peak of 'DeFi Summer', where demand for ETH was sky high for use as collateral in smart contracts.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWhilst BTC and ETH exchange reserves declined this week, stablecoins have on net flowed into exchanges, with over $1.04B in combined USDT, USDC, BUSD and DAI flowing in on 10-Nov. This makes for the 7th largest daily net inflow in history.\n\nLive Stablecoins and Exchanges Dashboard\n\nThis has pushed stablecoins held across all exchange reserves to a new all-time-high of $41.186B. We can also see a notable increase in BUSD dominance, with over $21.44B held in exchange reserves. This is likely a result of Binance's recent stablecoin consolidation towards BUSD, as well as its growing dominance as the largest exchange in the world.\n\nUSDT exchange reserves have declined slightly, and USDC reserves more dramatically over recent months, indicating a potential shift in market preference is underway.\n\nLive Stablecoins and Exchanges Dashboard\n\nInterestingly, a great deal of these stablecoins are being sourced from smart contracts, and have been withdrawn from Ethereum smart contracts at a rate of $4.63B per month. This acts to highlight how acute the demand for immediate dollar liquidity has become.\n\nLive Stablecoins and Exchanges Dashboard\n\nAs a result, the market has entered an interesting state, whereby centrally issued stablecoins are flowing into exchanges, whilst the two major crypto assets, BTC and ETH are being withdrawn at historic rates. The chart below is a two part model reflecting the following:\n\nA lack of 🟧 in the barcode trace indicates that exchanges have seen a net BTC + ETH outflow.\nThe oscillator shows the net inflow of stablecoins, minus the net USD flow of BTC + ETH. For positive values 🟢, it indicates an excess of stablecoin 'buying capacity' has flowed into exchanges.\n\nHere we can see that overall, the net buying power of stablecoins on exchanges has increased by $4.0B/mth. This demonstrates that despite market turmoil, investors appear to favor holding trustless BTC and ETH assets, rather than than centrally issued stablecoins at this time.\n\nThis is quite an intriguing signal, and could be argued to be a constructive sign of confidence in the base layer assets, and a case for the market seeking safety in self-custody.\n\nLive Stablecoins and Exchanges Dashboard\nBitcoin Balances Swell\n\nWith such large volumes of BTC flowing out of exchanges, we can see that across all wallet cohorts, the FTX event has triggered a distinct change in investor behavior. On-chain wallets, from Shrimp (< 1 BTC) to Whales (> 1k BTC) have experienced a net balance increase 🟦 throughout the FTX collapse. For some cohorts, this has been an almost perfect 180-degree turn from a regime of sustained distribution 🟥 over recent months.\n\nLive Professional Dashboard\n\nThe Shrimp cohort (< 1BTC) have added 33.7k BTC this week alone, resulting in a 30-day increase of +51.4k BTC. This level of balance inflow is the second largest in history, surpassing the peak of the 2017 bull market.\n\nLive Professional Dashboard\n\nThe Crab cohort, with between 1 and 10 BTC are similarly aggressive, pulling 48.7k BTC off exchanges, and approaching acquisition rates in line with the 2017 bull market peak. Entities holding < 10 BTC now command over 15.913% of the circulating supply, a new, and convincing all-time-high.\n\nLive Professional Dashboard\n\nWallet cohorts between 10 and 1k BTC are colloquially referred to as Fish, and Sharks. This cohort reflects entities with balances on the order of high net worth individuals, trading firms, and institutional investors.\n\nAfter several months of slowing balance growth, this week has motivated a significant cohort balance increase of 78.0k BTC, and one of the largest 7-day balance increases in history for this cohort. This likely reflects, in part, a 'withdraw now, ask questions later' mentality.\n\nLive Professional Dashboard\n\nFor Whales, defined as those with > 1k BTC, we have only considered coins directly flowing in and out of exchanges. This is to better reflect true investor activity for these large entities. Whales have actually been net accumulators over recent weeks, with a 30-day balance change of +53.7k BTC.\n\nTheir on-net participation over this week however has been an order of magnitude less than other cohorts, with only a modest balance increase of +3.57k BTC.\n\nLive Professional Dashboard\n\nLastly on the balance change front, we have Bitcoin miners, who are already an embattled industry, and under extreme stress due to recent coin price declines. As Hash Prices pushes to all-time-lows, miners have been forced to liquidate around 9.5% of their treasuries this week, spending 7.76k BTC. This is the sharpest monthly miner balance decline since September 2018, and demonstrates the pro-cyclical nature of Bitcoin miners.\n\nLive Professional Dashboard\nHODLers Resolve\n\nIn the last section of this newsletter, we will cover the response of the Bitcoin HODLers, to inspect whether there has been a discernible loss of conviction. Given the scale of impact, and far reaching consequences of the FTX implosion, if there was a time for HODLers to lose faith in the asset, it is likely now.\n\nLong-Term Holder supply, being that which is statistically the least likely to be spent, has declined by -61.5k BTC since 6-Nov. Approximately 48.1k BTC was spent over the last 7-days, which certainly registers as a non-trivial event. However, given the scale of balance change detailed above, and comparing to historical precedents, it is not yet of a scale to infer widespread loss of conviction. Should this develop into a sustained LTH-supply decline however, it may suggest otherwise.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThe chart below presents a 4yr Z-Score of the weekly sum of Revived Supply older than 1yr. Over the last week, 97.45k BTC which were older than 1yr have been spent and potentially returned to liquid circulation.\n\nThis represents a +0.83 sigma move on a 4yr basis, which is notable, but not yet of historical magnitude. Like LTH Supply, this is a metric to watch in case it develops into a sustained trend.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThe average age per BTC has also climbed to just over 90-days this week, which is triple that observed during the low volatility environment through Sept to Oct. The uptick in older coins being spent is noteworthy, and is in line with peaks seen during previous capitulation sell-off events, and even the 2021 bull market profit taking.\n\nA sustained up-trend or elevated level of Dormancy may indicate a more widespread panic has taken root amongst the HODLer cohort.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nFinally, we can return to our 4yr Z-Score construction, but this time for the weekly sum of coindays destroyed (CDD). Here we can see that after a lengthy period of an extremely dormant coin supply, the volume of coinday destruction this week hit +1.9 standard deviations above the mean. A total of 165M coindays have been destroyed this week, which is equivalent to the spending of 452.2k BTC that have been held for 1-year.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nOverall, there has certainly been a degree of immediate panic within the HODLer cohort. However, given the magnitude of the circumstances, this is arguably an expected result. What is likely of more interest is whether these spikes soften in coming weeks, which would suggest that this shake-out is more of an 'event', rather than a 'trend'.\n\nOn the other hand, a sustained push higher in older coins being spent, and a decline in LTH supply would be clear warning signs that a more widespread loss of conviction and concern may be in play.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe collapse of FTX is significant, and a real black eye to the industry. It is a truly horrendous event where users of a platform find themselves trapped, and have funds entrusted to a custodian lost. This is sadly a forest fire, and a deleveraging event that was due to happen eventually, and as is tradition, Bitcoin, and the industry will bounce back stronger.\n\nWe at Glassnode wish every single one of our readers the very best in these challenging times, and remain extremely confident in the resolve of an industry, which is routinely tested, unlike any other. In times like this, be like Bitcoin; resilient, robust; sound and unstoppable. There is a road of opportunity ahead.\n\nAs with all similar disasters of the past, time and dedication will heal the wounds, and this truly free market will learn from the mistakes, grow stronger, and come back more resilient than it was yesterday.\n\nTick tock, next block.\n\nTranslated channels\n\nWe are proud to have launched new social channels for:\n\nSpanish (Analyst: @ElCableR, Telegram, Twitter)\nPortuguese (Analyst: @pins_cripto, Telegram, Twitter)\nTurkish (Analyst: @wkriptoofficial, Telegram, Twitter)\nFarsi (Analyst: @CryptoVizArt, Telegram, Twitter)\n--\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nSlowly but Surely\n\nBitcoin faces strong resistance as it approaches several key on-chain cost basis. With very early signs pointing to a a positive shift in demand, and a convergence of market acquisition prices, the Bitcoin holder-base is slowly but surely becoming saturated by those with the strongest resolve.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nNov 7, 2022 • 10 min read\n\nFollowing a fourth consecutive US rate hike of 75bps, a small pull back has occurred in the Dollar Index allowing global equities a brief period of respite. However, the stress present in the bond market remains persistent with further inversions across the front end of the yield curve, most notably in the 3month T-Bill in respect to the 10yr risk-free rate.\n\nIn response, Bitcoin prices have experienced a relatively small upwards surge, applying upwards pressure on key on-chain cost-basis' in its first bid for recovery. This price action is supported by muted HODLer behavior and the first glimmers of demand re-entering the system, as the asset class attempts to begin the long climb out of the depths of the bear market.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nHODLers Remain Firm\n\nWe shall will our analysis with an assessment of the HODLer cohort, by inspecting their spending behaviors via the HODLer Net Position Change metric. This tracks the 30 day change in HODLed or Lost coin supply, which are the most dormant on-chain.\n\nA dichotomy in HODLer behavior can be observed on either side of the May 2021 sell off.\n\n🔴 Prior to this inflection point, HODLers can be seen aggressively distributing coins, realizing profits into the cycle topping formation. Distribution peaked at a rate of -150k BTC / Month, expending a total of -450k BTC in the process.\n🟢 Following a breakdown in price action, the spending footprint of HODLers transitioned into an accumulation regime, amassing coins at a rate of+40k BTC / Month. This regime has culminated in a cumulative inflow of +500k BTC over an 8 month period.\n\nThis process has fully replenished the reserve of coins distributed this cycle, and pushed the HODLed and Lost coins metric to a new ATH.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nThe opposite supply region to HODLed coins can be considered ‘Hot coins’, which are actively participating in day-to-day trade of the Bitcoin economy.\n\nThe supply younger than 6 months old which is available on the market has remained around historic lows since May 2022 and continues to decline, further reiterating the extreme level of HODLing present in the current market.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nNext, we assess the Realized Cap HODL Waves, which allow for the inspection of USD denominated wealth held by specific age cohorts. Isolating for coins younger than 3-months old can be used to approximate the wealth of the speculative investor class.\n\nCurrently, the USD wealth held by young coins is at an all time low, representing only 10% of the network Realized Cap. By virtue of a binary system, this means that wealth that is older than 3-months has reached an ATH in both relative, and absolute terms of the network Realized Cap. This suggests the HODLer cohort are the most dominant they have ever been, signalling a resounding refusal to spend and sell, despite the persistent challenges in global capital markets.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nSubsequently, we can employ the Realized HODL Ratio to compare this balance of wealth held between between young and mature coins in a macro scale oscillator. This can be considered under the following framework:\n\nAn uptrend in RHODL Ratio suggests growing dominance of USD wealth held by newer speculative buyers, and is typical of bull markets, and Bitcoin market tops.\nA downtrend in RHODL Ratio indicates growing dominance of USD wealth held in older coins, suggesting increased HODLing, and long-term accumulation behavior.\nA flat, range bound RHODL Ratio indicates that the rate of change between old and young dominance is at an equilibrium. This a transitional period is often observed around market inflection points such as distributive markets tops, and accumulation bottoms.\n\nAfter remaining within a downwards trending regime since the November ATH, the angle of RHODL descent is beginning to soften, suggesting the balance between young and old coin wealth is finding an equilibrium. This pattern is occurring at similar levels and duration to that observed in the 2018-19 market low.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n💡 New Dashboards Released\n\nWe have released a new HODL Wave Dynamics dashboard which explores the Bitcoin supply as it matures through various age cohorts.\n\nOur suite of Bitcoin dashboards are being redesigned to help Glassnode members solve problems, and answer key questions in the market. Our new dashboards include contextualized sets of Studio metrics, custom workbench constructions, and analyst notes for key topics in the Bitcoin space.\n\nWe can leverage the Adjusted Reserve Risk metric (a new variant by the original author @hansthered) which is a cyclical oscillator that quantifies the balance between the aggregate incentive to sell, and the actualized expenditure of long dormant coins.\n\nUptrends in Adjusted Reserve Risk suggest the incentive to sell is increasing, and the realization of profits is becoming the primary mechanic in the market.\nDowntrends in Adjusted Reserve Risk indicate the perceived opportunity of HODLing is increasing, thus HODLing is becoming the dominant mechanic in the market.\n\nThe formation of an accumulation bottom can be described by the Adjusted Reserve Risk metric under the following substructure:\n\n🟥 Phase 1: The incentive to sell collapses alongside post-blow-off-top price action, indicating an abrupt end to the traders market. Over time, gradual accumulation and HODLing becomes the dominant mechanic.\n🟧 Phase 2: The market perceived opportunity cost of spending coins approaches a maximum, as HODLing behavior reaches peak intensity, and the worst of the bear market passes by.\n🟩 Phase 3: The incentive to sell begins to show first signs of recovery, as new demand enters, profits are taken, and bottom formation takes place.\n\nPresently, the Adjusted Reserve Risk appears to have entered Phase 3, aligned with the peak in HODLing behavior observed above, and signalling a potential transition towards a regime of increasing incentives to sell. In other words, those who have held coins for long periods of time are likely to become the dominant source of sell-side pressure on the road ahead (a signal of potential seller exhaustion from the 2021-22 cycle).\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nA Burst of Interest\n\nA small, but noticeably consistent change is taking place in the Bitcoin transaction space, as a sustained impulse higher in total coins transferred hits our nodes Mempool. This observable change in character provides initial signs of a potentially constructive shift in demand.\n\nThis trend remains in its infancy but is one to monitor.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAnalyzing the transfer volume settled by the Bitcoin network on any given day, there has been a substantial decline from the $13B/day peak during the Jan to May 2021 rounded top, to a cycle low of just under $3B/day today, representing a -77% decline.\n\nHowever, we are beginning to see a initial signs of stabilization, and perhaps an uptick in daily volume settled from the September lows, now oscillating between $3B and $4B/day.\n\nLive Professional Chart / Advanced Variation\n\nAs highlighted above, the presence of young coins, often synonymous with retail investors, has waned since the May 2021 sell off. This is also evident by the decline in small sized transfer value settled each day.\n\nTransactions from $0 to $10k have seen a stark decline from $430B/day in Jan 2021, to $220B/day at the moment, a decline of -49%. Nonetheless, we can see early signs of stabilization taking place in transfer volume contribution from these smaller sized entities, whom tend to respond quickly and early to the emergence of an upside rally.\n\nThis feature which was also present in the 2018 bottoming formation period.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nIn contrast, we are seeing an opposite structure forming in transactions worth $1M+ with total volume from large participants continuing to decline. This again bares similarities to the 2018 bottom, where transaction volumes by larger entities were actually quite slow off the mark, waiting until the bullish trend was properly established before stabilization in transfer volume occurred.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWe can confirm this observation via the Relative Activity of Small and Large Entities metric. This metric takes into account the observable positive skewness in USD denominated Bitcoin transaction volumes. Here, we have constructed an oscillator that comparing the ratio between the 7-day MA, and the 365-day MA of median (small entities, 🔵), and mean (large entities, 🔴) transaction volumes.\n\nOnce more, we can highlight the similarity in structure between the activity of small and large entities during the 2018 bottom. Following the final capitulation in price action, the activity of small entities increased and effectively front-ran the 2019 and 2020 bullish impulses, suggesting an influx of small sized transactions, and thus an initial sign of returning demand.\n\nLive Professional Chart / Advanced Variation\n\nThe aforementioned thesis can be further explored by analyzing the Median RVT Ratio. This metric compares the balance between the network valuation, denoted by the Realized Cap, and the presence of retail participation levels represented by the Median Transfer Volume. This can be considered the number of “middle of the pack” transactions that are equivalent to the current network valuation.\n\nIncreases in the Median RVT Ratio suggest an ongoing expulsion of retail presence until equilibrium is reached.\nDecreases in the Median RVT Ratio generally indicates an increasing presence of retail participation.\nA stable Median RVT Ratio occurs when both retail participation and network valuation are constant, indicating an equilibrium of network usage. This has historically been associated with macro scale transitional periods.\n\nFollowing the sell-off punctuated by the LUNA-UST collapse, the presence of retail sized investors has been in equilibrium with the Realized Cap, suggesting a detox of speculative, low-conviction investors has occurred. The component of duration however does appear to be missing from the current regime when contrasted with the 2019 precedence.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nProduct Updates\n\nOctober was an exciting month at Glassnode, as we announced our acquisition of Accointing.com, and continued to release suites of new metrics, workbench constructions, dashboards, and more. See our latest Product Update for October for a full overview.\n\nOctober Product Update\nCost Basis Overhead\n\nWith very early signs of demand showing up across the network, it is prudent to assess market levels of interest that may lie ahead, particularly where longer-term investors may be engaged as sellers. As such, we can assess the on-chain cost basis for Long-Term Holders, Short-Term Holders, and the wider market.\n\nBoth the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis 🔴 and Realized Price 🟠 are trading at approximately the same level of $21.1k, which the market is currently contesting with.\nThe Long-Term Holder Cost Basis 🔵 remains higher up, trading at $23.5k and would be an area of interest for those investors who have weathered recent volatility, but remain unsure about stability in the the future.\n\nA notable decline in the Short-Term Holder cost basis can be observed in recent weeks, due primarily to the significant volume of coin redistribution that was discussed in the WoC 44. This acts to drive the average Short-Term Holder acquisition price closer to the market value, and signifies an increasingly advantageous position for recent market entrants.\n\nThe second key observation is the clustering of these three on-chain cost basis in such a close proximity. This indicates a cost basis convergence for the average Bitcoin investor, irrespective of holding time, which makes the investor cohort somewhat more homogeneous (a reset of investor psychology so to speak).\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe price insensitive HODLer cohort remain steadfast, as coins continue to flow into the HODLers aggregated treasuries, pushing their holdings to new ATHs. The wealth held by the HODLer class has also reached ATHs, potentially indicating a peak in HODLer strength as the incentive to realize profits begins to grow.\n\nAs HODLers attempt to sustain a floor price, it is the Short-Term Holders who must step in and inject organic capital into the system to aid in the stabilization of key levels. This is evidenced by both the structural change to Mempool activity as well as the surge of activity from small entities, as the demand for transactional verification and network usage slowly, but surely grows.\n\nDespite unprecedented conditions across global markets. the structural price action of Bitcoin remains similar to prior cycles as price marches towards both the market wide cost-basis, as well as the Short-Term Holder cost-basis. Reaction to these key levels will be imperative to monitor in the coming weeks, as a confirmed flip of these resistance levels suggests the first glimmers of recovery across the long, arduous road ahead.\n\nTranslated channels\n\nWe are proud to have launched new social channels for:\n\nSpanish (Analyst: @ElCableR, Telegram, Twitter)\nPortuguese (Analyst: @pins_cripto, Telegram, Twitter)\nTurkish (Analyst: @wkriptoofficial, Telegram, Twitter)\nFarsi (Analyst: @CryptoVizArt, Telegram, Twitter)\n--\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nHammering Out The Bottom\n\nBitcoin has rallied back above the key $20k psychological level this week, after many months of extremely low volatility. In this edition, we analyse how Bitcoin may be hammering out a near-textbook bear market floor, and what risks may lay on the road ahead.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nOct 31, 2022 • 9 min read\n\nBitcoin has rallied back above the $20k level this week, pushing off a low of $19,215, and trading as high as $20,961. After consolidating in an increasingly tight range since early September, this is the first relief rally in many months.\n\nIn this weeks edition, we will assess a suite of metrics which present a relatively consistent case for the market hammering out a Bitcoin bottom, with almost textbook resemblance to prior cycle lows. At this stage, the 2022 bear has inflicted severe financial loss, both on investors who have capitulated, and those who still weather the storm. The last remaining piece of the puzzle appears to be a component of duration, time, and ultimately, investor apathy.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nHammering Out The Bottom\n\nIn our previous WoC 41 report, we described the market conditions of the Bottom Discovery phase, particularly following a significant capitulation through the primary bear market floor (shown in dashed lines). This phase 🟪 has historically seen prices range bound between two well-known floor-tracking models:\n\nRealized Price 🟠: which can be considered as the average acquisition price per coin for the wider market. When the spot price trades below the realized price, the aggregate market can be considered to be in unrealized loss.\nMayer Multiple Lower Band (0.6*200 DMA) 🟢: The Mayer Multiple is simply the ratio between price and the 200D-SMA, a widely observed model in traditional financial analysis. This metric helps gauge over, and under-bought conditions, with cyclical oversold conditions historically coinciding with Mayer Multiple values below 0.6.\n\nRemarkably, this pattern has repeated in the current bear market, with the June lows trading below both models for 35 days. The market is currently approaching the underside of the Realized Price at $21,111, where a break above would be a notable sign of strength.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench-\n\nAfter identifying initial signposts for a typical bottoming formation, the next step is to define a potential range of price fluctuation for this stage of the bear market.\n\nTwo ideal candidates for approximating the range bottoming formation are the aforementioned Realized Price (Upper Band ~$21.1k) 🟠, as well as the Balanced Price (Lower Band ~ 16.5k) 🔵. Balanced Price represents the difference between Realized Price and Transferred Price (coinday time-weighted price). This can be thought of as a form of a “Fair Value” model, capturing the difference between what was paid (cost-basis) and what was spent (transferred).\n\nCompared to historical precedence, price has traded within this range for ~3 months, in comparison to prior cycles which lasted between 5.5 and 10 months. This suggests duration may remain a missing component from our current cycle.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nProduct Updates\n\nOctober was an exciting month at Glassnode, as we announced our acquisition of Accointing.com, and continued to release suites of new metrics, workbench constructions, dashboards, and more. See our latest Product Update for October for a full overview.\n\nOctober Product Update\nCoins Changing Hands\n\nAs highlighted in July (WoC 28), throughout the Bottom Discovery phase, diminishing investor profitability results in the redistribution of coin wealth, as weaker hands capitulate into extreme financial pain. This progressive changing of hands can be analyzed by tracking the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD), which illustrates the distribution of supply based on the acquisition price.\n\nThe magnitude of wealth redistribution can be highlighted by monitoring the change in the volume of coins with an acquisition price within the two pricing models highlighted above. The following two charts compare the URPD on the entry, and exit dates for the 2018-19 bear market:\n\nURPD as of 19-Nov 2018 when price first broke below the Realized Price.\nURPD as of 2-Apr-2019 when price broke out above the Realized Price.\n\nDuring the 2018-2019 bottom discovery phase, around 22.7% of the total supply (30.36% - 7.65%) was redistributed as spot prices traded within in the aforementioned range.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nLive Professional Chart\n\nPerforming the same analysis in 2022, we can see that around 14.0% of supply has been redistributed since the price fell below the Realized Price in July, with a total of 20.1% of supply now having been acquired in this price range.\n\nCompared to the end of the 2018-19 cycle, both the magnitude of wealth redistribution, and the final supply concentration at the bottom are somewhat lower in the 2022 cycle. This adds further evidence to the case that additional consolidation and duration may still be required to fully form a bear market floor.\n\nThat said, the redistribution which has occurred to date is significant, and certainly indicates that a resilient holder base is actively accumulating within this range.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nLive Professional Chart\nSeeking the Light\n\nWith many longer-term components of a bear market floor in play, the next step is to introduce a series of indicators which are useful for mapping out a potential transition back towards a bull market. The Percent of Supply in Profit metric can be used to establish three distinct states of each market cycle:\n\nEuphoria (Profit-Dominance) 🟩: When a parabolic price uptrend is in play during the bull market, the Percent of Supply in Profit exceeds 80%.\nBottom Discovery (Loss-Dominance) 🟥: At the twilight of the bear market, when an extended period of price depreciation causes the share of supply in loss to become dominant (Percent Supply in Profit < 55%)\nBull/Bear Transition (Profit-Loss Equilibrium) 🟧: The transition periods between the two prior conditions, where Percent Supply in Profit remains between 55% and 80%.\n\nAt present, the Percent of Supply in Profit is at 56%, which indicates that the recent price recovery above $20k is at the lower bound of the transitional phase, signalling that an appreciable redistribution has occurred below $20k to date.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can also assess the implied financial strain on the Long-Term Holder (LTH) cohort and their corresponding reaction.\n\nDuring the late stages of a bear market, a pattern that is congruent through all cycles is the capitulation of a sub-set of the LTH cohort 🟥. These capitulations are identified by periods where the aggregate LTH Cost Basis 🔵 is above than the overall market cost-basis Realized Price 🟠. This means that the average Long-Term Holder, who has weathered the full cycles volatility, has actually underperformed the wider market.\n\nThis condition of acute financial stress has been in play for 3.5 months so far, which is shorter than similar intervals in previous bear markets. However, note that this condition is usually in play until well into the bull market transition.\n\nLive Professional Workbench \n\nConfirming the ongoing stress on Long-Term investors, we can define a simple but powerful compass to spot early indications of new demand entering the market 🟩.\n\nWhen the capital inflow of new investors (Short-Term Holders) begins to exceed sell side pressure, the aggregated profit held by the wider market will exceed that of the Long-Term Holder cohort.\n\nInterestingly, we have not yet observed this shift in profitability, with the Percent of LTH Supply in Profit 🔴 currently at 60%. Considering the total Percent Supply in Profit 🔵 is at 56%, in order for this model signal to signal a recovery 🟩, spot prices likely need to reclaim the $21.7k level.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nEmbracing Losses\n\nSo far, we have assessed the market from the holders perspective (the unrealized profit/loss). The aforementioned shift in momentum can also be examined from the active investors point of view (realized profit/loss).\n\nTo accomplish this goal, we utilize the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio metric, which measures the ratio between the volume of coins moved in profit to those coins that are transferred in the loss. Tracking the quarterly average of this metric enables analysts to gauge the macro dominance of coins moving in profit.\n\nProfit Dominant Regime > 1 🟩: At the early stages of the bear markets, and throughout the bull run, demand is strong enough to adsorb selling pressure, and profits exceed losses by a wide margin.\nLoss Dominant Regime < 1 🟥: During the extended phase of the bear markets, where the supply side is not met with sufficient demand. This generally culminates as a large-scale capitulation event, which acts to entice smart capital back into the system.\n\nThe interval between dropping below, and reclaiming the 1.0 level, is often where bearish sentiment is at its peak and demand liquidity at its lightest 🔵.\n\nThe 90D-SMA of Realized Profit/Loss Ratio typically collapses and remains below 1.0 mid-way through a bear, but before ultimate capitulation, providing an early warning signal. Moreover, this metric has historically recorded a sharp cross over the 1.0 level in early bull phases.\n\nAt the current state, this indicator is at 0.57, denoting the dominance of coins moving at a loss remains. Therefore, the new wave of capital, and profit taking has not yet fully eclipsed the magnitude of sellers realizing losses.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAs the final piece of this investigation, we aim to analyze the magnitude of Realized Losses. To account for the rising market capitalization each cycle, we normalize Realized Loss by the market cap to produce a Relative Realized Loss metric. Next, we can construct an indicator using the the Monthly 🔴 and Yearly 🔵 sum of Relative Realized Loss to identify shifts in momentum, and significant capitulation events.\n\nDuring the last three bear markets, the monthly value has abruptly peaked above the yearly during two distinct periods of extreme realized loss.\n\nPost-ATH Wave (A): At the early stages of a bear market, when a top-heavy market undergoes its first large wave of loss realization during the post-ATH sell-off.\nBottom Discovery Wave (B): Late stage bear markets often culminate with a major capitulation event, where a significant wave of loss realization occurs, and peak negative sentiment is reached. This wave is often intensified by the stress of the time component of establishing a market floor, until sellers finally hit exhaustion.\n\nRevisiting the historical instances of this pattern, it is evident that both A/B waves of loss realization have occurred at scale. The second wave B is usually of a much higher magnitude, and is often followed by a notable descending trend in the yearly trace 🔵. This is the result of the market reaching peak apathy and seller exhaustion.\n\nThese are the constructive signs of the market embracing the financial pain inflicted on remaining investors by both the time, and price components. However, the final condition before a convincing transition towards a bull market is a substantial decline ↘️ in the yearly cumulative trend.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nIn this edition, we have leveraged multiple floor-price tracking models and demonstrated that the market certainly appears to be in a near textbook example of a Bitcoin Bottom Discovery phase. The Balanced Price ($16.5k) and Realized Price ($21.1k) have once again helped establish range-bounds while the market hammers out a foundational floor.\n\nThe portion of supply which has changed hands and been repriced so far is significant, although smaller in magnitude compared to the 2018-19 lows. We also demonstrate that across several metrics, the 2022 floor lacks a degree of duration, and perhaps an additional phase of redistribution is needed to test investor resolve.\n\nFrom both the Unrealized and the Realized Profit/Loss standpoints, the results indicate that a fragile but constructive balance between supply and demand exists in the market. However, the network has not yet experienced a convincing influx of new demand yet. It does not appear that the bear-to-bull transition has formed as yet, however, there does appear to be seeds planted in the ground.\n\nTranslated channels\n\nWe are proud to have launched new social channels for:\n\nSpanish (Analyst: @ElCableR, Telegram, Twitter)\nPortuguese (Analyst: @pins_cripto, Telegram, Twitter)\nTurkish (Analyst: @wkriptoofficial, Telegram, Twitter)\nFarsi (Analyst: @CryptoVizArt, Telegram, Twitter)\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics, dashboards and charts, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Case for Bitcoin Bulls and Bears\n\nAs the volatility of Bitcoin markets compress to historical lows, we present both the bull and the bear case for Bitcoin. We cover the $1.5B overhang of a miner deleveraging, weak on-chain activity, persistent draining of exchanges, and unwavering HODLer conviction.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nOct 24, 2022 • 11 min read\n\nThe volatility of Bitcoin markets have come to resemble those of a stablecoin, trading within an incredibly small $869 range. Just 4.6% separates the weekly low of $18,793 from the high of $19,662.\n\nAs covered in last weeks newsletter, periods of extremely low volatility for Bitcoin are very rare, and there are historical examples that have broken both higher, and lower, with extreme force.  Thus, in this weeks edition, we will lay out both a Bull and Bear case from a primarily on-chain perspective, covering the following topics:\n\nOn-chain activity and utilization of the network remains persistently weak, suggesting lacklustre network effect expansion.\nMiners are on the cusp of severe stress, with some 78.2k BTC held in treasuries at risk.\nExchange BTC balances continue to drain, whilst an excess of $3B/month in stablecoin buying power is flowing in.\nThe HODLer cohort have reached all-time-high coin ownership, and steadfastly refuse to release coins back into the market.\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\n🐻 A Case for the Bears\nThere is Nobody Home\n\nOn-chain activity is a powerful suite of tools for measuring and modelling network utilization. The simple interpretation framework is that network effects are constructive, and thus a sustained and positive momentum in Bitcoin user activity is likely constructive for the asset.\n\nThe chart below assesses the momentum of new on-chain addresses, comparing the short-term (monthly 🔴) vs long-term (yearly 🔵) moving average. As can be seen in Nov 2018, a failure of the monthly average to attain positive momentum was a precursor to a sell-off from $6k to $3.2k. Conversely, Jan 2019 represented a burst of new activity which propelled markets from $4k to $14k.\n\nNew Address Momentum is on the cusp of yet another push higher, but is yet to show a convincing 2019 burst of strength. With a slight curl over in recent weeks, this suggests a lacklustre inflow of new demand at present.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea:New Addresses (30D-SMA) breaking above 410k would signal an improvement in momentum, and an early signal of a potential market recovery.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe growth rate of addresses with a non-zero balance has also stagnated since August, which is also similar to the November 2018 period. This indicates that despite there being some 400k New Addresses per day, there are as many which are being emptied of their entire balance.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Non-Zero Balance Address Count breaking below 42.6M would signal a significant purge of wallets is underway, and may signal distribution and market weakness.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTransfer volume (USD) has also collapsed towards this cycle lows, falling to $19.2B/day. This is now below the transfer volume peak seen back in December 2017, and is only marginally higher than the lows in May to July 2021.\n\nThis indicates a significant degree of apathy exists within the Bitcoin network, with extremely muted on-chain activity suggesting a lacklustre read on network utilization, attention and user base growth.\n\nIt is very quiet on-chain.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Change-Adjusted Transfer Volume (7D-EMA) breaking below $18B would signal a notable decline in network settlement throughput, and may signal further market weakness.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nOf note however, is a recent character change observable in the mempool. The volume of coins transferred in transactions hitting our nodes mempool has seen a sustained burst higher since September.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe same can be seen in the number of transactions sent, with a very modest increase in the average fee rate paid. Whilst very early, and short-term in nature, this aligns with New Address Momentum approaching the yearly average.\n\nThese metrics provide a potential view of a changing tide, albeit require an uptrend to be established and sustained to increase the odds of a true market recovery. In the instance these turn out to be simply fleeting events, the macro negative trends described above are more likely to prevail.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nMiners on the Cusp of Chaos\n\nThe mining industry has been in the spotlight of late, with hashrate and difficulty pushing to new all-time-highs (covered in WoC 40). This acts to increase the cost of BTC production, despite miner revenues per hash falling to all-time lows.\n\nThe Difficulty Regression Model is an estimated all-in-average cost of production, and is coincident with the spot price of $19.3k at the time of writing. A bearish cross-over was last seen in mid-2018, with a major mining industry capitulation following soon after, and persisting for several months.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIndeed, the mining Hash Price has reached all-time-lows this week, with miners earning just $66.5k/day per Exahash applied. With Hash Price now falling below the post 2020 halving lows, despite coin prices being ~2x, this demonstrates just how extreme the recent increase in hashrate competition has become.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIn order to quantify the risk of miners distributing their treasuries, we need to first consult a metric which demonstrates our label coverage of Bitcoin miners. Here we use the Miner Block Subsidy as a proxy measurement of hashrate. The assumption is that any labelled miner who earns 10% of the block subsidy, won 10% of the blocks, and thus likely has 10% of the hashrate.\n\nIn the post March 2020 era, our labelled miners 🔴 cover upwards of 95% of the network hashpower (especially since the May 2021 Great Migration out of China). Unknown miners labelled as 'Other' 🟡 account for the remaining < 5%.\n\nThus, we can reasonably consider the balance held by all miners excluding Patoshi and 'Other', to provide a gauge on the coin volume at risk in miner treasuries.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe chart below shows that miner balances have increased by 10x since 2019, with a total of 78.2k BTC held today. This is worth $1.509B at a price of $19.3k, which is a non-trivial overhang for an increasingly distressed industry.\n\nOf this, the vast majority is held by miners associated with BinancePool, Poolin, Lubian, and F2Pool. All have seen a stagnation of their balance in 2022, suggesting that prices below $40k have imposed income stress, and motivated a behavioural shift.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nOverall, the Bitcoin demand side, as measured by on-chain activity and network participation, is lacklustre to say the least. There are some green shoots of hope in the mempool, however there remains a $1.5B overhang of coins held by the mining cohort, whom are in extremely distressed territory.\n\nA deleveraging event of miners may lead to distribution into thin orderbooks (WoC 42), historically light demand, and persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and liquidity constraints.\n\n🐂 A Case for the Bulls\nExchanges Drain\n\nDespite fairly unimpressive on-chain utilization profile, the net impact of the transactions which are taking place maintain a constructive undertone.\n\nOctober has seen a marked shift in balance change behaviour by most wallet cohorts. Cohorts from Shrimp (< 1BTC) through to Whales (up to 10k BTC) have altered their behaviour from one of net balance decline and distribution 🟥, and towards one of net accumulation and balance increase 🟦.\n\nGiven prices have remained flat and of low volatility, this suggests a tendency towards patient accumulation at range lows.\n\nLive Professional Chart (Glassnode Engine Room)\n\nThis can be visualized in the URPD chart, broken into Short-Term Holders (STHs, 🔴) and Long-Term Holders (LTHs, 🔵). We can see that the volume of coins changing hands to new recent buyers (STHs) increases notably at prices between $18k and $20k, reinforcing the observations above.\n\nA significant 'air-gap' exists between $12k and $18k, where very little coin volume has transacted, and thus price discovery to the downside could be highly volatile in the event the bulls fail to hold the line.\n\nAlso apparent is a very large distribution of coins held by LTHs at prices well above $30k. As we have covered in prior editions (WoC 39), these Bitcoin holders are the least price sensitive, and at this stage, could be argued to be at peace with their held unrealized losses.\n\nLive Professional Chart (Glassnode Engine Room)\n\nThe reserves held on exchanges have also continued their relentless decline, dropping to multi-year lows throughout October, and retracing back to Jan 2018 levels. In effect, all coin volume which flowed into exchanges since the last cycle high, has now been withdrawn into a non-exchange associated wallet.\n\nOctober alone saw 123.5k BTC withdrawn, equivalent to 0.86% of the circulating supply. Whilst exchange reserves alone are not a signal unto themselves, within the context provided above and below, it provides a constructive backdrop.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nCoinbase has seen a very large scale net withdrawal of -41.6k BTC this week, bringing the total decline from the post-March 2020 balance peak to -48.4%. It is important to note that these outflows are based on our best estimate wallet clusters, and appear to be a combination of coins flowing into both investor wallets, and/or institutional grade custody solutions.\n\nAt the very least these wallets have not intersected with any other exchange related wallets, and thus are highly likely to reflect a changing of hands.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAnother observation associated with exchanges is the balance between the 30-day net flows of the two major assets, BTC and ETH, compared to the combined 30-day net flow of the four largest stablecoins USDT, USDC, BUSD and DAI.\n\nThis metric consists of two components:\n\nThe barcode will return 🟠 when the flow of BTC and ETH  into exchanges is positive (i.e. net USD denominated inflows of the two major assets).\nThe net position change will return 🟢 when the flow of stablecoins into exchanges is larger than the USD value of BTC and ETH (positive buying power), and conversely will return 🔴 when more BTC and ETH value has flowed in than stablecoins (negative buying power).\n\nAt the moment, we can see that the 30-day netflow of BTC and ETH has been withdrawals, and simultaneously, an excess of $3B/month in stablecoins have flowed into exchanges, increasing relative buying power.\n\nUSD reserves are increasing, whilst coin available to buy is declining.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nHODLers HODL On\n\nWith the on-net flows through exchanges appearing to have a bullish lean towards appreciable accumulation, we can then assess whether there is any loss of conviction amongst existing longer-term holders.\n\nThe total USD wealth held in BTC, valued at the time of each coins last transaction, is now disproportionately skewed to longer-term holders. The proportion of wealth held in coins that moved in the last 3-months is now at an all-time-low. The reciprocal observation is that wealth held by coins older than 3-months (increasingly held by HODLers) is now at an all-time-high.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThis is further validated by the Binary Liveliness metric, where we can draw two key observations:\n\nThe steepness of the Liveliness decline is accelerating, indicating the market is very heavily aligned with HODLing style behaviour. Old hands are simply not spending.\nThe Binary Liveliness oscillator, which compares recent steepness vs a rolling 30-day baseline, is at extreme lows. Such events are coincident with extreme HODLing behaviour, usually seen during early-mid stage bear market accumulation (the grind), and immediately prior to bullish reversals (a supply squeeze).\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTo close, we can confirm the above observations have a bullish bias by observing the trend and magnitude of long-term holder supply. Here we have two traces shown:\n\n🟣 Shows the actual trace of LTH-Supply, which is now at an all-time-high of 13.82M BTC, representing 72% of circulating supply.\n🟠 An offset applied to LTH-Supply, moving it backwards by 155-days. This is an attempt to model where the original acquisition took place by this cohort.\n\nInspecting the latter 🟠 curve, we can see a very similar bear market pattern to 2018 emerges with respect to the LTH acquisition behaviour. Of the most interest however, is the extremely strong upwards trajectory ↗️ throughout the LUNA collapse in May 2021.\n\nDespite prices having since sold off 56%+, from $40k down to sub-$18k, an industry wide deleveraging event, and historic global macro-economic turmoil, the LTH cohort added significantly to their holdings throughout this period.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThe bullish case for Bitcoin at present is one of unwavering conviction, and persistent balance growth by the HODLer cohort. Liquid coins continue to flow out of exchanges, relative stablecoin buying power is increasing, and extreme volatility and severe downside has thus far failed to shake out Bitcoins most die-hard believers.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nIn this edition, we sought to provide a bearish and bullish case for Bitcoin given the historically low volatility profile, which rarely ends with a whimper. With a likely explosive move on the horizon, we can use on-chain data to gauge the supply an demand balance.\n\nThe Bear Case is one of a historically low on-chain utilization profile, and a looming miner deleveraging event. With a $1.5B miner overhang, being just one source of distressed BTC, and multi-year lows in both trading and transfer volumes, significant distribution may meet thin orderbooks.\n\nThe Bull Case takes a view on the HODLers of last resort, whereby the supply flows out of exchanges, and into HODLer wallets is at an all-time-high. Despite being small in relative number, the conviction of Bitcoins die-hard believers is unshaken, and their balance continues to grow, through thick and thin.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Coiled Spring\n\nThe Bitcoin market is primed for volatility, with both realized and options implied volatility falling to historical lows. Futures open interest has hit new all-time-highs, despite liquidations being at all-time-lows. Volatility is likely on the horizon, and Bitcoin prices rarely sit still for long.\n\nCheckmate, UkuriaOC, Glassnode\nOct 17, 2022 • 9 min read\n\nBitcoin markets continue to consolidate into a a tight price range, with almost all of the extreme prices of the weekly range reached during a 24hr window. In response to US inflation data coming in slightly hotter than expectations, BTC prices traded down to $18,338, followed by a quick rally to a high of $19,855, before completing a round trip to the weekly open price.\n\nIn this weeks edition, we will explore how the Bitcoin market is currently in a period of historically low volatility, and with many metrics both on, and off-chain signalling a period of elevated volatility is likely ahead. Historical precedents in bear markets have broken out from such market structure in both directions, with little directional bias evident in futures markets pricing.\n\n🔔 Alert Ideas are presented throughout to help identify key metric levels of interest that may signify significant shifts in market/network performance. Any Glassnode member can set an alert directly from Glassnode Studio.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nVolatility is Imminent\n\nIt is very uncommon for BTC markets to reach periods of such low realized volatility, with almost all prior instances preceding a highly volatile move. Historical examples with 1-week rolling volatility below the current value of 28% in a bear market have preceded significant price moves in both directions 🟦.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nA similar compression can be seen within the aSOPR metric which measures an average realized profit/loss multiple for spent coins on any given day.\n\naSOPR of 1.0 in a bullish trend often acts as support, as market participants tend to increase their position at their cost basis, manifesting as buying the dip.\naSOPR of 1.0 in a bearish trend often acts as resistance, as investors seek exit liquidity around their cost basis, with investors seeking any available exit liquidity.\n\nA large divergence is currently forming between price action, and the aSOPR metric. As prices trade sideways or decline, the magnitude of losses that being locked in are diminishing, indicating an exhaustion of sellers within the current price range.\n\nAs the weekly average of aSOPR approaches the break-even value of 1.0 from below, it is increasingly likely that volatility is on the horizon, either as a breakout, or yet another rejection.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: aSOPR (7D-SMA) breaking above 1.0 could signal an improvement in market profitability, and is an early signal of a potential market recovery.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nInspecting the aSOPR metric by constituent investor cohorts, we can isolate the contribution of the Short-Term (STHs) and Long-Term Holders (LTHs). We will start with the STH class, where we can identify two similar cases in history:\n\nThe 2015-2016 Bear Market 🟢 experienced a divergence between price and STH-SOPR. This divergence was confirmed with a STH-SOPR breakout above 1.0, followed by several supportive retests of the level. This indicates a psychological switch from securing exit liquidity, to buying the dip near the cohort cost basis.\nThe 2018-2019 Bear Market 🔴 also experienced a divergence between price action and spent profitability, however, this culminated as a rejection from the break-even level as participants overwhelmed demand, and sought exit liquidity at their cost basis.\n\nCurrently, STH-SOPR is approaching a break-even threshold once again, with the most recent attempt in August failing to sustain a break higher.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: STH-SOPR (7D-SMA) breaking above 1.0 could signal an improvement in market profitability, and is an early signal of a potential market recovery.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nBy comparing the monthly spending patterns of the STH cohort to their yearly baseline, we can establish whether a macro momentum shift in profitability regime is occurring.\n\nWhere Monthly Growth > Yearly Growth 🟢 STHs are realizing more profits of late, which increases the probability of a constructive reversal.\nWhere Monthly Growth < Yearly Growth 🔴 STHs are realizing more losses of late, indicating that seller exhaustion has not been reached, and increases the probability of a STH-SOPR rejection at breakeven.\n\nThe STH-SOPR multiple is attempting its fifth breakout of this bear cycle, battling for a shift in momentum. Each prior attempt was met with rejection, and a subsequent decline in prices. However, the severity of drawdowns in the STH-SOPR multiple are diminishing with time, reflecting increasing likelihood that seller exhaustion is occurring.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nConversely, Long-Term Holder spent profitability continues to languish at historical lows, with this investor cohort locking in losses of around -48% on average. With price remaining remarkably stable of late, it is evident that the main transactors from the Long-Term Holder cohort are those from the 2021-2022 cycle, who continue to capitulate their positions at a loss.\n\nThese periods of extreme LTH profitability stress generally occur towards the depths of the bear market with only 3.3% 🟣 of trading days incurring higher losses.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: LTH-SOPR (7D-SMA) breaking below 0.50 could indicate a further flush out of the LTH cohort, with less than 3% of trading days seeing larger average LTH losses.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nOff-Chain Volatility Brews\n\nIn the off-chain domain, volatility is also brewing in the derivatives markets. Options pricing of short-term implied volatility (IV) has reached an all-time-low of 48% this week. Several prior instances of such low IV has preceded violent moves, often compounded by the de-leveraging of derivatives and DeFi markets.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTrading volumes in futures markets have also declined to multi-year lows of $24B per day. This returns to levels last seen in December 2020, before the bull cycle had broken through the 2017 cycle $20k ATH. This may signal a lower liquidity trading environment should the market find momentum in either direction.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe have also seen an aggressive, and consistent increase in Futures Open Interest since the collapse of the LUNA-UST project. BTC denominated futures Open Interest has reached a new ATH of 633k BTC, which is an 80% increase since May this year.\n\nThis suggests that levels of speculation, and/or hedging positions are increasing, despite coin prices declining significantly over this time.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThereafter, we can assess the Futures Estimated Leverage Ratio to investigate the relative scale of open contracts compared to the balance of BTC reserves held across all major exchanges. We can similarly observe the remarkable growth in futures open interest relative to the BTC balance on exchanges.\n\nThis provides another indication that a somewhat low liquidity environment is in play, and could result in an elevated impact on spot markets should some of this leverage unwind.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAnother metric we can use to assess the health of futures markets is the proportion of positions using Crypto or Cash as margin.\n\nCrypto-margined collateral such as BTC or ETH is inherently more volatile, as fluctuations in the value of underlying collateral can amplify deleveraging events.\nCash-margined collateral such fiat or stablecoins effectively hold 1-1 with the dollar, and do not fluctuate in value alongside the open futures position.\n\nUsing this framework, we can observe the evolution of market preference over time:\n\nThe peak dominance of Crypto-Margined collateral reached 70%, and marked the height of exuberance in April 2021. This was followed by a major decline in digital asset prices.\nA regime switch occurred after the May 2021 sell-off, with Cash-margined collateral becoming the dominant choice, causing crypto-margin dominance to fall to 35% today.\n\nCash-margined collateral dominance reached an ATH this week, indicating that the vast majority of the new open interest, are cash margined positions. As such, the health of the derivative collateral structure has vastly improved over the last 18-months. This acts to reduce the probability of an amplified liquidation cascade, whilst also demonstrating the growing market demand for stablecoin collateral.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nDuring the exuberant speculation seen around Feb to Apr 2021, the futures cash-and-carry trade was yielding between +45%/yr and +100%/yr for rolling 3-month contracts, and perpetual futures, respectively.\n\nThis has declined dramatically ever since the May 2021 sell-off, with both the the rolling 3-month basis (0.55%/yr) and perpetual funding rates (1.97%/yr) now trading at negligible yields, especially relative to prevailing rates for many sovereign bonds. Both annualized funding rates and annualized rolling basis also briefly entered backwardation in late August.\n\nDespite challenging price conditions, and a persistent increase in futures open interest, there remains no notable directional bias within the current futures positioning. This increases the chances that much of this leverage is may be utilized for the hedging of risk, rather than directional speculation.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nFollowing this, we can assess the total Long and Short liquidations as a percentage of total Open Interest across all futures contracts. This provides insight into the proportion of open interest cleared via liquidations, rather than discretionary position closes.\n\nTotal liquidations are now historically low, hitting just 0.1% of total open interest, which is somewhat counter-intuitive given the marked increase in futures positions and leverage. Long positions 🟢 remain the dominant liquidated position, however only by a small margin, with 54% of liquidations being longs this week.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nOverall, this set of derivatives market observations likely suggests a more sophisticated set of risk hedging positions are prevalent in the current market. These positions likely treat Bitcoin as a high beta asset in both the instance of severe drawdown, or in the case of a volatile break higher, and are thus less sensitive to directional pricing.\n\nThis is based on the persistent decline in crypto-margin dominance, near uninterrupted increase in open interest as prices fall, but accompanied by historically low liquidation volumes, and almost no directional bias in cash-and-carry yields. We can also note that almost the exact opposite set of conditions was prevalent at the April 2021 ATH, which we have argued was the true end of the 2021 Bitcoin bull market.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe Bitcoin market is primed for volatility, with both realized and options implied volatility falling to historical lows. On-chain spending behavior is compressing into a decision point, where spot prices intersect with the Short-Term Holder cost basis.\n\nPrevious instances where this set of conditions was prevalent have preceded violent price moves, with examples in previous bear cycles being in both directions. There remains little discernible directional bias in futures markets, despite open interest pushing to new ATHs.\n\nVolatility is likely on the horizon, and Bitcoin prices are not known to sit still for very long.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Calm Before The Storm\n\nIn stark contrast to highly volatile equity, credit, and forex markets, Bitcoin has remained remarkably stable in recent weeks. With Bitcoin gaining ground on many traditional assets, we evaluate if true bottom formation may be in play, and adjust several metrics for the influence of lost coins.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nOct 10, 2022 • 10 min read\n\nRecent weeks have seen an uncharacteristically low degree of volatility in Bitcoin prices, in stark contrast to equity, credit, and forex markets, where central bank rate hikes, inflation, and a strong US dollar continue to wreak havoc. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin has been remarkably stable and has gained ground against many assets on a relative scale.\n\nBitcoin markets traded slightly higher this week, rallying from a low of $19,037 to a high of $20,406. Prices remain rangebound, consolidating for over 120 days since the major deleveraging event in mid-June.\n\nAs investors attempt to establish a bear market floor, we can compare the market structure to past cycle lows. In this edition, we undertake a series of studies assessing the behavior of Whale sized entities, and make adjustments to many bottom formation metrics, to better account for the influence of lost and long HODLed coins.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nA Fragile Equilibrium\n\nGenerally, a sustained price momentum can often be associated with a supporting trend in net on-chain accumulation, or distribution. This correlation is often most heavily driven by larger entities’ behavior (i.e. High net worth Individuals, Whales, and institutional capital).\n\nThe significance of large entities can be gauged by their share of the total circulating supply. As the Relative Address Supply Distribution chart shows, bigger addresses (holding >100 BTC) has gradually declined from 70%, to 60% share in of the total supply since early 2011 (although note that the coin value has changed significantly over this time).\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThe Accumulation Trend Score reflects the aggregated balance change intensity of active investors over the past 30 days, where a higher weight is assigned to larger entities. Approaching value of 1 indicates that, on aggregate, larger entities (or a large sub-set of the network) are adding meaningful volumes to their onchain balance (and vice versa for values close to 0).\n\nReviewing values during the later stages of the 2018-2019 bear market, a series of distinctive intervals can be identified:\n\nPre-Capitulation Equilibrium: While the spot price converges towards the long-lasting cycle baseline (dash line), the supply and demand sides remain in Equilibrium 🔲.\nCapitulation: With price action breaking below the cycle baseline, the market enters a capitulation phase. Interestingly, the larger entities tend to intensify their Accumulation 🟢. These strong-accumulation intervals are usually followed by an Equilibrium 🔲 period.\nBottom Discovery: Throughout the bottom formation stage, due to the lack of demand, there are one or more incidents that a short-term rally is met with large entities Distribution 🔴 (known as Bear Market Rally).\n\nRemarkably, after breaking the current cycle baseline at $30K, a series of consecutive events similar to the 2018-2019 bear market has taken place. Throughout the capitulation in early 2022, the Accumulation Trend Score indicates significant accumulation by large entities has taken place, as well as the seizure of the recent bear market rally to $24.5k for exit liquidity. At present, this metric suggests an equilibrium (neutral) structure in the market, which remains similar to early 2019.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTo conduct a more detailed analysis, the Accumulation Trend Score by Cohort can be consulted. Here we compare the market structure to the post-capitulation stage of the 2018-2019 bear market.\n\nWe can see that large entities, particularly 1k-10k BTC wallets, contributed to a distribution event 🟥 during a rally off the lows in March 2019, and entered a period of equilibrium afterwards. Small retail-level participants (< 1 BTC) maintained heavy accumulation 🟦 throughout 2018 and 2019.\n\n Live Engine Room Chart\n\nIn our current market structure, and noting an approximate 10x in BTC prices, we can see very similar behavior occurring in large entities, however driven more so by the 100-1k BTC cohort during the August rally.\n\nIn addition to the relative neutrality across small to medium-address cohorts, the Accumulation Trend Score for whales holding 1k-10k BTC highlights aggressive accumulation since late September. Whales owning >10K BTC are biased towards weak distribution over recent months.\n\n Live Engine Room Chart\n\nWe can see increased net whale withdrawal volumes in recent weeks, with a net outflow from exchanges hitting 15.7k BTC, which is the largest since June 2022.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWe can calculate the cost basis for all whales who have been actively speculating over a chosen time period, can deliver a threshold level that is psychologically important to these investors. By price stamping the deposits and withdrawal volumes of the whale cohort (1k+ BTC) to/from exchanges, we can estimate the average price of Whale Deposits/Withdrawals since Jan-2017. This Whale cost basis is currently around $15.8k.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nNew Product Updates: September\n\nSeptember was an extremely exciting month for Glassnode, engaging our entire team, from engineering, data scientists, and analysts, to deploy a brand new suite of Ethereum Merge and Proof-of-Stake metrics. We released 8x Analysis Reports, 16x Metrics, 19x Workbench Constructions, and 2x Dashboards.\n\nRead our Product Updates for September\nDeclining Profit and Rising Pain\n\nAs we discussed in Week 25, tracking the diminishing supply in profit is a powerful technique to identify points of elevated financial stress, which have exhausted sellers in previous cycles.\n\nSurveying the Percent Supply in Profit during the bottom formation stages of prior bear markets shows that cyclical lows have generally occurred alongside supply profitability of 40%-42%. Currently, 50% of the circulating supply is in an unrealized profit, suggesting that supply profitability remains elevated in relation to historical analogues. This insinuates a full detox in profitability may not have occurred yet.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nMoreover, the rising trend of cyclical lows in the Percent Supply in Profit graph has been a prominent pattern since the 2014-2015 bear market. A key driver of this macro trend is the impact of lost coins, and inactive supply (including the Patoshi coins). To investigate the effect of these coins, the chart below illustrates the total Supply in Profit alongside the Supply Last Active +7 Years Ago, which can be presumed lost or inactive.\n\nCurrently, 3.7M bitcoins have been inactive over the past +7 years, which is equal to 34% of the current Supply in Profit.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nBy adjusting the Supply in Profit 🟠 with this inactive supply, we can calculate the Adjusted-Percent of Supply in Profit 🔵. The resulting chart shows that at the lowest point of bear cycles tends to drop to around 39%, however with a similar conclusion; it has been worse in prior cycles.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe intensity of implied financial strain on the remaining investors can be traced by the Relative Unrealized Profit metric. This indicator measures the normalized total profit of all coins in the supply, which adjusts for an increase in capital flows into the Bitcoin asset each cycle.\n\nAn investigation of historical data shows that when aggregated Unrealized Profit compresses to ~30% of the Market Cap, a large proportion of the selling pressure has been alleviated (seller exhaustion). The price depreciation since November 2021 has caused this ratio to sink to 0.37, reflecting a meaningful, but not as painful outcome as prior lows.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) is a metric which maps out the difference between unrealized profit and loss of the network as a proportion of the market cap. NUPL takes into account both the loss and profit held in the supply through various phases of a market cycle.\n\nSince early June, NUPL has dropped into a compressed negative range of 0% to -15% on two separate events, lasting a total of 88 days so far. From a comparative perspective, NUPL has traded down to levels lower than -25% in prior cycles, and remained negative for between 134-days (2018-19) and 301-days (2014-15).\n\nNote that NUPL cycle lows have also gradually climbed as a result of both lost and long HODLed coins.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nNext, we can apply the same methodology utilized to adjust the Percent of Supply in Profit for the NUPL metric. This corrects for any contribution from inactive supply producing the Adjusted-Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (aNUPL) 🔵.\n\nThe key observation from this modification is that by removing the impact of >7 years old coin (inactive supply), aNUPL has has been trading below zero for the last 119 days which is comparable with the time length of prior bear markets’ bottom formation phase.\n\nAlso, the lowest value recorded for aNUPL (-39%) in the current bear market has dropped below the -25% threshold level, which indicates the severity of the ongoing undervalued market structure.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nDistribution of Pain and Gain\n\nAfter evaluating the intensity of financial stress across the network, we can examine its distribution of across both Long-Term (LTH) and Short-Term Holders (STH). This analysis aims to identify equivalent market structure patterns during the bear market.\n\nLooking at Short-Term Holder Supply in Profit/Loss, there are many instances where price corrections paused as the entire (>99%) of short-term holders’ supply fell into loss 🔵. At the moment, 18.1% of the total supply is in possession of STH, with 15.1% held at an unrealized loss. This leaves just 3% of supply held by STHs and in profit, which after such a prolonged downtrend, is likely approaching a degree of seller exhaustion.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nStudying the Long-Term Supply in Loss metric suggests that at points where LTH Supply in Loss surpasses 20% of the total supply 🔴, the probability of capitulation amongst these investors reaches a peak.\n\nWith over 31% of the supply now held by LTHs in loss 🟥, it is increasingly likely the market has passed this stage, which also suggests a similar condition to prior bottoming formations. The market has been in this phase for 1.5 months, with a previous cycle duration ranging from 6 to 10 months.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nFinally, we can compare the average acquisition price per coin for the STH cohort 🔴 against the LTH cohort 🔵, to approximate the relative stress levels. As discussed in WoC 37, the continuous price depreciation during a prolonged bear market leads the STH Realized Price to fall below the LTH Realized Price 🟪.\n\nThis market structure denotes periods where the average cost of acquisition over the past 155 days, is now lower than the average LTH-cost basis. In other words, those who are just entering have a better cost basis than those who have weathered months of volatility.\n\nThis is a direct outcome of LTH capitulation, where coins purchased near the cycle top are sold and change hands at much lower prices.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the market entered into this stage and compared to prior bears, has taken between 145-days and 339-days to recover. With the LTH cost basis at $23.3k, and STHs at $22.1k, this sets a key price zone to expect resistance at first, but potentially greener pastures if prices trade higher, and stay higher.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nBitcoin prices have shown remarkable relative strength of late, amidst a highly volatile traditional market backdrop. Several macro metrics indicate that Bitcoin investors are establishing what could be a bear market floor, with numerous similarities to previous cycle lows.\n\nNetwork profitability has not quite hit the same level of severe financial pain as past cycles, however adjustment for lost and long HODLed coins can explain a reasonable portion of this divergence.\n\nIn many ways, many on-chain metrics, market structure, and investor behavior patterns are dotting of the i's, and crossing the t's for a textbook bear market floor. A principle piece which is missing is duration, of which history would suggest there may be several months still ahead before a full recovery.\n\nTranslated channels\n\nWe are proud to have launched new social channels for:\n\nSpanish (Analyst: @ElCableR, Telegram, Twitter)\nPortuguese (Analyst: @pins_cripto, Telegram, Twitter)\nTurkish (Analyst: @wkriptoofficial, Telegram, Twitter)\nFarsi (Analyst: @CryptoVizArt, Telegram, Twitter)\n--\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nHashrate Hits New Highs\n\nAs global equity and bond markets continue to tread challenging ground, Bitcoin hashrate defies the odds, pushing to yet another all-time high. In this piece, we deep dive into the mining sector to assess whether the worst of the miner capitulation is over, or not.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nOct 3, 2022 • 9 min read\n\nGlobal equity and bond markets continue to tread challenging ground, with growing evidence of stress developing in sovereign debt and currency markets this week. Of particular note was the dislocation experienced in the United Kingdom Gilt market, where bond yields soared, the British pound fell to all-time-lows against the US Dollar, and the Bank of England reestablished quantitative easing to reliquify markets.\n\nAmidst such extremes, Bitcoin prices have remained notably stable, consolidating within an increasingly narrow range between $19,921 and $20,239. Such quiet periods are very uncommon for Bitcoin, with semblance to both pre-crash November 2018, but equally to pre-rally March 2019.\n\nDespite severe price drawdowns, and global macro turmoil, Bitcoin hashrate has remarkably pushed to yet another all-time high this week. We last covered the stress developing in the Bitcoin Mining sector back in June (see WoC 23, and WoC 25). This week, we will revisit with a deep dive into the production side of Bitcoin, which appears to be recovering remarkably well, a signal which has historically been constructive in the months that followed.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nMining Competition Increases\n\nAs the bear market rages on, Bitcoin hashrate has reached a new all-time-high of 242 Exahash per second. To give an analogy for scale, this is equivalent to all 7.753 Billion people on earth, each completing a SHA-256 hash calculation approximately 30 Billion times every second. These are extraordinarily large numbers.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Bitcoin hash-ribbons commenced an unwind in late August, providing an indication that mining conditions were improving, and hashrate was coming back online. Interestingly, the current environment has not yet seen prices recover, signalling this hashrate rise is due to more efficient mining hardware coming online and/or miners with superior balance sheets having a larger share of the hashpower network.\n\nAlmost all historical hash-ribbon unwinds have preceded greener pastures in the months that followed.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe Mining Pulse provides another tool to monitor miner activity, measuring the average block interval relative to the target of 600-seconds.\n\nLower values indicate blocks are faster than 600-sec, signalling hashrate is growing faster than the regulating difficulty adjustment can keep up.\nHigher values indicate blocks are slower than 600-sec, signalling hashrate is coming offline, often in response to industry shocks such as capitulation events.\n\nAs shown in blue, the recent miner capitulation has been a multi-month affair, starting in late May and with recovery starting in early August. As shown in pink, previous bear markets have typically ended with more of a dramatic event, with severe and rapid declines in hashrate.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this is more subdued but protracted capitulation event is simply the appetiser, or whether it reflects a new dynamic as more of the hashpower is held by better capitalised publicly traded mining companies.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nNew Product Updates: September\n\nSeptember was an extremely exciting month for Glassnode, engaging our entire team, from engineering, data scientists, and analysts, to deploy a brand new suite of Ethereum Merge and Proof-of-Stake metrics. We released 8x Analysis Reports, 16x Metrics, 19x Workbench Constructions, and 2x Dashboards.\n\nRead our Product Updates for September\nThe Price of Production\n\nAs hashrate comes back online, Mining Difficulty has recommenced a series of upwards adjustments, having risen 27.9% since the Great Miner Migration peak in May 2021.\n\nHigher protocol Difficulty implies an increasing cost of production per unit of BTC as more hashpower competition enters the network. This is occurring at a time where miner revenues are already stressed due to lower coin prices, which should, in theory, create elevated income stress on the mining industry.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIndeed, we can see that the revenue earned per Exahash has been in a persistent and long-term downtrend, with the BTC-denominated reward currently at an all-time-low of 4.06 BTC per EH per day.\n\nOn a USD-denominated basis, this equates to between $78k to $88k in revenue per EH per day. This has returned to Oct-2020 levels, which was after the 2020 halving event, and where BTC prices were around $10k (currently ~$20k). From this, we can see that a 66% increase in Difficulty and Hashrate since Oct-2020 corresponds to an approximate halving in revenue per hash.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nNumerous models have been proposed to evaluate, and estimate the network wide cost of production for BTC, many of which consider Difficulty as an essential input parameter. Difficulty effectively represents a protocol defined measure of the all-in-hurdle-rate in order to solve the next block, and win the reward.\n\nThe Difficulty Regression model is a fairly simple interpretation of this, calculated as a log-log regression between Difficulty and Market Cap, sporting an exceptionally high R2 coefficient of 0.944. This model last intersected spot prices around $17,840, at the lows of the June 2022 sell-off. It is currently hovering around $18,300, which is just below this weeks market lows.\n\nThis would indicate that miners are somewhat on the cusp of acute income stress.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nA brand new valuation framework was proposed by analyst kuntah this week, which fits a non linear relationship between the cost of production, and the input parameters of Difficulty, and Issuance. The model seeks to capture the point of maximum miner efficiency, being at the bottom of bear markets when only the strongest miner balance sheets and operations are profitable.\n\nThree traces are shown:\n\n🔴 Current Estimate Cost of Production of $12,140, located around the centroid of the last cycles trading history, and the genesis of the 2020-21 bull run. Note that this reflects a price floor model, fitted to the lows of bear market capitulations.\n🟣 Post 2024 Halving Cost of Production $24,230 (assuming constant difficulty).\n🟠 Geometric mean of the two aforementioned traces $17,080, providing a gauge of the most likely price of acute miner income stress.\n\nSimilar to the Difficulty Regression Model, the price range between $17k and $18k has confluence as being an area that induced miner stress in June, and aligns with numerous cost of production estimates.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nHas Miner Capitulation Risk Passed?\n\nHaving established price areas of interest relating to miner profitability and income stress, we can review a series of metrics which help describe these events.\n\nFirst, the Puell Multiple, which is a cyclical oscillator that compares the current daily mining revenue to their yearly average. The Puell Multiple hit the current lows of around 0.33 in June, indicating that miners were earning just 33% of their yearly average revenue. It has since recovered to around 0.63, implying a degree of stress relief, and adjustment to this new pricing regime.\n\nAll previous bear cycles have experienced a strong rally off the lows in the Puell Multiple, associated with short-term price relief once a true bear market low is established.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe Puell Multiple and cost of production models are implied stress models, where we estimate prices where miner revenues may come under pressure (thus necessitating additional coin distribution). We can bolster this case by using explicit stress models such as the Hash ribbons, or the Difficulty Ribbon Compression, which react only to the observable changes in the hashpower markets.\n\nThe model below combines the implied income stress of the Puell Multiple, with the explict stress observation of the Difficulty Ribbon Compression. As of the time of writing, this model has only just exited levels where miner capitulation is statistically likely.\n\nHowever, note that in all previous bear markets, there are a handful of days where this happens fleetingly. Thus full confirmation is yet to be established, but is one to watch for a more sustained recovery.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nIf we look at the aggregate size of miner balances, we can see that around 78.4k BTC remain held by miners we have labelled (accounting for ~96% of current hashrate). The cohort of 'Other' unlabelled miners is much larger at around 660k BTC, however this includes accumulated (and likely lost coins) from miners from the early years of Bitcoin.\n\nThis provides a gauge of the risk, with some 78.4k BTC held by miners who may come under income stress.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nTo finalise our assessment, we look to the actual coin distribution patterns of miners to see impacts on their treasury balances. The chart below is the 30-day change in miner wallets, and whilst distribution has slowed, it remains at a level of around 4.5k BTC per month. This is a decline of 50% since the peak in early September, however.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nHowever, digging further into this, we can identify that a great majority of current expenditure is sourced from miners associated with Poolin. The orange curve below shows the all-miner 30-day change, whilst the blue curve is specific to Poolin, demonstrating that almost all spending is associated with this cohort.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nPoolin was, until very recently, one of the largest mining pools in the industry, accounting for over 15% of hashrate in early 2020, and 12% at the start of September. After an announcement that Poolin was experiencing 'liquidity issues', the estimated hashrate directed at the pool plummeted, representing just 3.7% of the hashpower network today.\n\nIn a Market Pulse report released at the time, we demonstrated how to use Glassnode tools to estimate the hashrate of a specific mining pool. The methodology uses their share of block reward revenue relative to the total as a proxy, enabling us to visualise just how quickly miners can redirect hashrate in times of distress.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nAmidst global chaos in traditional markets, Bitcoin prices remain remarkably stable, in a multi-month consolidation between $18k and $20k. It is extremely rare for BTC prices to stay so stationary for long, suggesting heightened probabilities of volatility on the horizon.\n\nBitcoin mining hashrate reached new all-time-highs this week, driving up the cost of production for BTC, at a time where miner revenues have only just recovered from the recent capitulation. By numerous models, we estimate that the average cost of BTC production hovers just below current prices, such that any significant price decline could turn an implied income stress, into acute and explicit stress.\n\nThis risk could manifest as a second stage miner capitulation, with around 78.4k BTC still held in miner treasuries. It is extremely unlikely this full amount would be distributed, however provides an upper bound gauge on the potential risks at hand.\n\nTranslated channels\n\nWe are proud to have launched new social channels for:\n\nSpanish (Analyst: @ElCableR, Telegram, Twitter)\nPortuguese (Analyst: @pins_cripto, Telegram, Twitter)\nTurkish (Analyst: @wkriptoofficial, Telegram, Twitter)\nFarsi (Analyst: @CryptoVizArt, Telegram, Twitter)\n--\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

However, HODLers remain steadfast, with numerous metrics displaying a full cycle detox.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nSep 26, 2022 • 11 min read\n\nAs the evaporation in global liquidity continues, emphasized by new local highs on the DXY index, Bitcoin has remarkably shown a degree of relative strength. BTC prices remained range bound this week, trading between a peak of $19,639 and lows of $18,309. However, price action is just barely hanging on to the consolidation range lows set in July, holding the line from what could be further capitulation.\n\nIn this edition, we shall analyze the activity profile of the network from the pillars of adoption, retail participation, and settlement utility. We will also explore the concept of lifespan to further understand the symbiotic relationship between network activity and participant spending behavior.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nAll That Remains\n\nInitially, we will explore the New Entities Metric, which is a measure of network adoption, and captures a best estimate of the number of new unique entities that transacted on the Bitcoin Network. Here we can see that around 83.5k new entities are coming online per day, which a new macro low for the 2020-22 cycle, but remains higher than the 2018 bear market low, which reached a minimum influx of 66.5k new entities per day.\n\nLive Professional Metric\n\nBy comparing the level of average monthly adoption, to the average yearly adoption, we can establish when a macro momentum shift in network adoption is underway.\n\nIf Monthly Growth 🟠 > Yearly Growth 🔵, network adoption can be considered to be expanding and recovering relative to the longer-term baseline (shown in 🟧 below).\nIf Monthly Growth 🟠 < Yearly Growth 🔵, the network adoption can be considered to be contracting and deteriorating relative to the longer-term baseline (shown in 🟪 below).\n\nIn our present cycle, network growth first entered a contracting regime 533 days ago, with only a brief period of 52-days respite in March-April 2022. The 2018-20 bear market has a few more periods of adoption recovery, notably around the mid-2019 rally to $14k.\n\nMonthly network adoption recently collapsed below the level set following the Great Miner Migration in May-2021. This signifies that an appreciable recovery is not yet underway, and there is a declining influx of new users to the network.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nNext, we can use the Median Transaction Volume metric to reflect the behavior of smaller sized transactions. As explored in the Market Pulse #3: Understanding Network Participation through Means and Medians, the Median Transfer Volume represents the “middle of the pack spend”, and thus can be used as a proxy to represent the participation of small entities. This can be considered under the following framework.\n\nIncreases in the Median Transfer Volume generally signifies to an increase in retail participation.\nDecreases in the Median Transfer Volume generally signifies a decrease in retail market participation.\nA stable Median Transfer Volume has historically occurred after an expulsion of retail participants, this a indicates stable usage of the remaining network participants (HODLers, career traders, large money).\n\nCurrently, the structural decline of the Median Transfer Volume appears to be in the process of gradually flattening out. This softening of trend suggests the market may be entering a phase of relative stability, indicating that the network is close to a full detox of speculative interest, and is approaching an equilibrium baseline of users.\n\nLive Professional Metric\n\nWe can further explore this thesis by performing a similar monthly vs yearly check on the Median Transfer Volume. This ratio attempts to capture changes in the momentum of retail participation relative to longer-term trend.\n\nIf the Monthly Baseline > Yearly Baseline it signals an expansion in retail participation.\nIf the Monthly Baseline < Yearly Baseline it signals a decline in retail participation.\n\nFollowing the Great Miner Migration, a period of retail expulsion can be observed 🟪 which has been in effect for 426 days. This is a similar duration to the retail investor purge observed during the 2018 bear market, which persisted for 474 days before the monthly average recovered above the yearly average.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nThe final metric to inspect network activity is Miner Revenue from Fees. Miner Revenue from Fees is directly related to the level of demand for blockspace and thus network congestion, which has historically been a leading indicator for macro market trend reversal.\n\nA sustained high fee regime indicates consistent and persistent demand for blockspace, elevated network usage, and suggests a constructive view on demand.\nA muted low fee regime indicates a lack of demand for blockspace, minimal network congestion, and suggests a lacklustre view of network participation.\n\nIt is clear that the Bitcoin network remains in an extended muted fee regime, further confirming a recovery in demand is not yet underway. Network activity by and large remains a barren wasteland, with New Entity Adoption falling beneath cycle lows whilst a complete exodus of retail participation is most apparent.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nAugust Product Update Post\n5x Week On-chain Newsletters\n5x Market Pulse Reports\n4x New Assets supported\n24x New Ethereum Breakdown metrics\n5x New Bitcoin Supply and Derivatives Metrics\n19x New Workbench Construction Pre-set Metrics\nAugust Product Update\nA Full Detox\n\nNext we will explore the volumes of lifespan destroyed in the network, often considers synonymous with tracking the smart old money vs the new and inexperienced money. Lifespan incorporates both the age, and the volume of the coins spent in an attempt to gauge amount of “stored time” expended.\n\nThe Spent Volume Age Bands metric provides a breakdown of on-chain transfer volumes into age bands to assess whether spending is dominated by old hands losing conviction, or not.\n\nHere we isolate only coins of mature status (6-months+), which displays a clear compression within the current price structure. The dominance of mature coins being spent has collapsed from an exuberant 8% at the height of the bull in Jan 2021, to a distribution of just 0.4% of all volumes.\n\nThis suggests that the cohort of investors with older coins remain steadfast, refusing to spend and exit their position at any meaningful scale. Whilst this is constructive in that it displays HODLer conviction, with such a lacklustre demand profile as a backdrop, such an observation may be best interpreted as HODLers bunkering down for the storms ahead.\n\nLive Advanced Metric\n\nThis sentiment is echoed by the Realized Capitalization HODL Waves metric which displays the USD Wealth held by individual age bands. With mature spending severely muted, the degree of HODLing behavior is historically high.\n\nIn a binary system of just Young and Mature coins, an increase in mature coin wealth held in BTC directly leads to an equivalent decrease in Young coin wealth.\n\nCurrently, wealth held by mature coins is at an ATH, due to the dominant investor behavior being a refusal to spend despite exceedingly uncertain global markets. Thus, almost all market activity is being conducted by the same cohort of young coins repeatedly changing hands. As the number of young churning coins incrementally decreases, it can lead to an eventual supply squeeze if and when the market tides turn.\n\nLive Advanced Metric\n\nThe 90-day Coin Days Destroyed (CDD-90) metric assesses the total sum of coin day destruction over a 90 day period, helping to visualize periods of higher, and lower coin age expenditure.\n\nCDD-90 has reset to what is effectively an all-time-low (ignoring pre-price history) signifying that older coins are essentially the most dormant they have ever been. This emphasizes the historically significant scale of HODLing which is taking place in the market, and adds weight to the case of extreme HODLing being the dominant investor behavior.\n\nLive Advanced Metric\n\nRevived Supply 1+ Years provides confirmation that the volume of latent supply re-entering the active supply is extremely low. This metric has been statistically normalized to highlight large deviations from the mean spending behavior. This can be considered under the following framework.\n\nDeviations above 2 Sigma 🔵 indicates that a large volume of supply has been revived relative to historic values.\nDeviations below 2 Sigma 🟠 indicates that the volume of latent supply which is returning to the market is statistically low.\n\nThis metric provides confluence with the observations above, where a compression in the spending of long dormant coins is clear, and large upside deviations are occurring less frequently.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nWe can also observe a stark contrast between the magnitude of revived supply in a bull market, compared to the prevailing bear.\n\nAs prices broke out above the $20k cycle high in 2020, a flurry of mature aged supply realized profits into market strength. With prices pushed into the $40k region, this +13.5 sigma deviation marked the cyclical maxima, and acted as a warning of potential oversupply. This can be similarly compared to 2018 price action, which recorded a peak deviation of +14 sigma.\nAs prices collapse back towards $20k in 2022, the market has responded with an opposite reaction, a sustained period of exceptionally low mature coin spending, and in fact the most quiet since the 2018 bear market lows on a statistical basis.\n\nIt is clear that owners that have held their Bitcoin through the volatility of the last year are simply not interested in selling at these price levels, having experienced the full spectrum of volatility and downside that Bitcoin is infamous for. It appears increasingly likely that the Bitcoin HODLers who remain, are strapped in, and willing to go wherever the Bitcoin ship takes them.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nA Short-Term Holders Market\n\nBy assessing the structure of coin distribution, separated into both Short-Term and Long-Term Holders, we can ascertain 3 key observations:\n\nAlmost all coins acquired above $30k are successfully migrating into Long-Term Holder status 🔵 which are statistically unlikely to be spent in the face of further volatility.\nThe majority of coin churn is apparent around the current market price with the Short-Term Holders 🔴 jostling for the best entry price. This reflects both a recent capitulation, and an equal an opposite influx of demand within the current consolidation price range.\nA large supply airgap is apparent below $18k until the $11-12k range. Trading below the current cycle low would put an extraordinary volume of Short-Term Holder coins into a deep unrealized loss, which may exacerbate downside reflexivity, and trigger yet another wide ranging capitulation event.\n\nThe Long-Term Holder cohort appear relatively unfazed by the price action of 2022, and their supply price distribution remains constructive. In contrast, the Short-Term Holder cohort are responsible for the majority coin movement, with a heavy concentration around the current market price. Thus, it is the STH cohort which is of the most of interest from here.\n\nLive Metric in the Glassnode Engine Room\n\nWe shall initially assess their profitability across cycles, to better understand typical spending behaviors. This structure can be considered in the following three phases.\n\nPhase 1: Collapse 🔴: This occurs after cycle tops as a rapid collapse in price actions sends the STH cohort into deep loss.\nPhase 2: Compression 🟡 :  As prices collapse lower, STH profitability also compresses. Eventually a point is reached STH coins are clustered around spot prices, and thus their cost basis is in-phase with the market.\nPhase 3: Expansion 🟢: With the STH cost basis now close the market price, any meaningful market rally puts large swathes of STH coins into an unrealized profit, triggering easier psychological conditions to HODL through.\n\nSTH profitability remains deep within phase 2 and has been here for 431 days, which is the longest duration out of any bear market cycle to date.\n\nLive Professional Metric\n\nTo further isolate STH behavior, we introduce a new variant of the Market Realized Gradient Oscillator specifically related to STHs (the STH-MRGO). This is a statistically normalized oscillator, designed to measure relative changes in momentum between speculative value, and true organic capital inflows for the STH cohort. Again, three distinct phases can be identified:\n\nExpansion 🟢:An expansion in momentum as speculative capital outpaces organic STH inflows, leading to prices climbing rapidly.\nCollapse 🔴: As prices reach unsustainable heights, a collapse in price action becomes inevitable, leading to an initial wash-out of the STH cohort.\nTransition Period 🟠: The momentum of price action and STH capital flows establish an in-phase equilibrium with price, as sellers become exhausted, and STH coins concentrate at what  becomes the eventual price range of the bear market bottom.\n\nBased on the two charts above, it appears as though the STH cohort is approaching an equilibrium, which historically occurs in the latest stages of a bear market. The principle risk is that this large concentration of STH coins around the current price, becomes yet another dam to break, requiring a new equilibrium to be established.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nNetwork activity remains in a dire condition as network adoption levels slump to levels last seen during the COVID crisis. However, one constructive observation would be the expulsion of retail participants from the network leaving just the HODLers class, career traders and everyday Bitcoin users remaining. This suggests the user-base is at its foundational level.\n\nThe HODLer class remain resolute with both mature coin USD wealth reaching ATHs, and a multitude of lifespan metrics fully resetting to historical lows, emphasizing the unwillingness to spend held coins. This suggests the majority of current market churn is associated with the Short-Term Holder class.\n\nThe Short-Term Holders find themselves at an equilibrium period where speculative market flows, and the STH cost basis are in-phase. With such a large concentration of supply in the current consolidation range, a risk remains of a levee break, should prices lose the June $17.5k lows.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nProduct Update released for August.\nReleased a large set of Derivatives, Supply, and Market Indicator Workbench Pre-sets for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nTranslated channels\n\nWe are proud to have launched new social channels for:\n\nSpanish (Analyst: @ElCableR, Telegram, Twitter)\nPortuguese (Analyst: @pins_cripto, Telegram, Twitter)\nTurkish (Analyst: @wkriptoofficial, Telegram, Twitter)\nFarsi (Analyst: @CryptoVizArt, Telegram, Twitter)\n--\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Merge: A Feat of Engineering\n\nThis week saw the successful deployment of one of the most impressive feats of engineering in the blockchain industry: The Ethereum Merge. We explore it as it happened, on-chain.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nSep 19, 2022 • 10 min read\n\nThis week saw the successful deployment of one of the most impressive feats of engineering in the blockchain industry: The Ethereum Merge. The switching of the consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), has been on the Ethereum roadmap, and actively worked on since genesis and is a remarkable milestone for the project.\n\nAs of 15-September at 06:46:46 UTC, at Ethereum blockheight 15,537,393, the final PoW mined block was produced, and the PoS Beacon Chain took over chain consensus. The Ethereum Merge was successful.\n\nArguably, there is no better chart to demonstrate just how dramatic this transition was, than observing Ethereum Mean and Median blocktimes. Here we can clearly see the end of the probabilistic, and naturally variable PoW mining, and the switch to the engineered precision of PoS, sporting a consistent 12-second blocktime.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nIn this report, we will explore this historic event, as it happened, across both trading markets, and on-chain blockchain metrics. We will analyse the Merge from the following angles:\n\nPositioning of leveraged traders in Futures and Options markets.\nThe effect of the Merge transition on consensus parameters.\nCurrent total ETH staked and the distribution of staking providers.\nModelled vs actual impacts on the ETH supply.\nNew Ethereum Metrics, Workbench Presets, and Dashboards\nSource Image: Ethereum Foundation\n\nWith the Ethereum Merge now behind us, we are pleased to launch a suite of new Ethereum Proof-of-Stake metrics, Workbench Pre-sets, and Dashboards.\n\nNew PoS Metrics:\n\nBlock Production: Slot Height, Epoch Height, Missed Blocks, Orphaned Blocks\nNetwork Stability: Participation Rate, Attestation Count\nValidator Movement: Voluntary Exit Count, Active Validators, Slashing Event Count\nValidator Balances: Total Effective Balance, Stake Effectiveness, Average Validator Balance, Staking Deposits\nValidator Economics: Estimated Annual Issuance ROI per validator ,Estimated Annual Issuance\n\nNew Dashboards: Proof-of-Stake Consensus and Proof-of-Stake Supply Dynamics\n\nWorkbench Pre-sets: Net Inflation Rate, Net Supply Change, Post-Merge Supply Dynamics, Change in Active Validators, Cumulative Exit Events, Total and Effective Balance, Staked Realized Price\n\nSelling The News\n\nIn our WoC 32 Report, we described how market positioning across Futures and Options markets appeared to be well hedged for a sell-the-news style event. Indeed, ETH prices have sold off, from a weekly high of $1,777, to around $1,650 at the time of the Merge, before collapsing to a low of $1,288 on Sunday.\n\nThe market has effectively given back all gains made since mid July. Such a sell-off is the result of multiple factors, not least of which being traders taking profits after ETHs recent out-performance. Being one of a small handful of assets that performed well during recent months in the prevailing macro-economic conditions, it is quite unsurprising that profits were taken, where profits were available.\n\nRight up until the Merge, traders in perpetual futures markets were paying an eye-watering 1,200% annualized in funding rates to maintain their short ETH positions. This is a new all time low negative funding rate, eclipsing the previous peak of -998% hit during the March 2020 sell-off.\n\nFunding rates have since completely reverted to neutral, suggesting much of the short-term speculation premium has dissipated.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTotal Futures Open Interest declined by 15% from $8.0B to $6.8B after the Merge, with both of these extremes being fairly typical in the context of 2021-22 markets. However, to keep this change in context, we must account for the influence of a changing ETH coin-price, which affects the USD value of ETH-denominated futures position sizes.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIf we inspect Open Interest in an ETH denominated basis, we can see that futures Open Interest is actually at all-time-high, having increased by almost 80% since early-May. Over the last week, there appears to have actually been an increase in futures leverage, rather than a decrease, suggesting many risk hedging positions have not been closed.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIn options markets, where a large amount of recent ETH speculation took place, Call option Open Interest has declined by $600M post-Merge (a 10% decline). There remains a total of $5.2B in outstanding call option position value, which is still much higher than 2021 norms. Put option markets experienced a more significant relative drop of 19%, but this remains a much smaller scale $294M in net position value closed.\n\nIn many ways, it appears that ETH markets remain heavily utilized, levered up, and speculating on further upside, despite a -22% ETH price correction.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nThe On-chain Merge\n\nThe end of the Proof-of-Work Ethereum era was marked by an immediate decline of mining difficulty to zero after the Merge. This process was instantaneous, with no wind-down period, nor any difficulty adjustments taking place. Revenue for PoW miners has effectively evaporated, leaving a fleet of GPU, and ASIC mining rigs seeking a new purpose.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIn place of miners, PoS utilises a pool of validators, which are programmatically organised into sets of committees, and block proposers for each 32-slot Epoch. One validator is assigned the role of block producer for each 12-second slot. However, in some instances, this validator may be offline or unreachable at the time, resulting in a Missed Block.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe measure this aggregate validator network uptime using the Participation Rate metric, which is the ratio between the number of blocks successfully produced (i.e. not missed), and the total available slots. As the chart below shows, Participation rates well in excess of 99% have been the norm for much of the Beacon Chains life to date. It will be an interesting performance metric to watch as more load is imposed on the chain, and more validators enter the fold.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the Merge, a slight decline in Participation Rate can be observed, falling below the typical 99% level to around 97.5%. Post-Merge, this has reverted back into the 99%+ range, suggesting only a brief disruption to some sub-set of validators.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe number of attestation votes on the chain-tip also experienced a brief pre-Merge decline, but has similarly recovered back into the expected 32k to 38k attestations/hour range. It is possible this reflects node issues with a larger sized staking operator, or perhaps a software client bug, where numerous validators were affected in a short window of time.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nEthereum currently has over 429.6k Active Validators on the network. The chart below shows the last 6-months, where the gradient of new validators can be seen to increase markedly in the lead up to, and following the Merge. Over 11.36k Validators have come online in September alone, signifying a growing investor confidence as the technical challenges of the Merge are de-risked.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWhen validators opt into, or out of the staking pool, they are constrained by a protocol set limit on total validator churn per Epoch. The chart below shows this cap (blue trace) alongside a somewhat barcode style chart, which shows the daily change in Active Validators. We can see a handful of periods where the influx of validators hit the limit cap in the past.\n\nThe recent burst of new validator activity in September is visible, although it remains quite light relative to the heavier periods seen in 2021.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWith a total of 429.6k Active Validators, there is now over 14.586M ETH staked, representing 12.2% of the total ETH supply. The Total ETH staked will change over time as a result of:\n\nNew Deposits, and eventually Withdrawals (after the Shanghai Fork)\nRevenue earned from issuance and fees (balance increase)\nInactivity leak if validators often miss blocks or attestations (balance decreases).\nSlashing in the event of malicious behavior (balance decreases).\n\nThe Total Staked Balance differs from a new metric called Effective Balance, which is the portion of ETH which is actively participating in consensus. Effective Stake is capped per validator at 32 ETH on the upside, and decreases to the nearest 1 ETH increment below this in the event of leaking or slashing.\n\nThe total Effective Balance is currently at 13.801M ETH, resulting in a Stake Effectiveness rate of 94.6%.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nA majority proportion of Staked ETH is hosted by a variety of staking service providers that we monitor, accounting for 10.071M ETH (69.04% of the total). The top 4 service providers are Lido, Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, whom manage a combined 8.18M ETH staked, account for 56.08% of the total stake.\n\nOne of the newest growing staking pools we monitor, Rocketpool, is a distributed validating node operator competing with market leader Lido. Rocketpool remains very small in scale, but is growing, with 228.2k ETH hosted, and representing 1.56% of the total stake so far.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nNew Content: Before The Merge - Analyzing the Ethereum Beacon Chain\n\nThe #Ethereum Merge introduces a suite of new on-chain metrics which describe Proof-of-Stake consensus. In our latest collaboration with CoinMarketCap, we explore these new Proof-of-Stake metrics and profile Beacon Chain network performance since genesis. Read our new report profiling the Beacon Chain.\n\nBefore The Merge - Analyzing the Ethereum Beacon Chain\nThe Reality of Supply\n\nOne of the most talked about components of the Merge has been the dramatic decline in supply issuance, which when coupled with the EIP1559 burn, is expected to lead to a degree of ETH supply deflation.\n\nSince the Beacon Chain genesis on 1-Dec-2020, Ethereum has actually had two sources of net supply issuance, the PoW chain, and the PoS chain. In Aug-2021, EIP1559 was implemented, which created a fee burn feature on the PoW chain, a feature which has now moved to the PoS chain.\n\nThe chart below is a suite of traces, showing the net daily ETH issuance under various simulated, and actualized conditions. It attempts to model and visualize the daily net change in the ETH supply, in the time since EIP1559 was implemented.\n\nThe area chart displays the actual condition, which consists of PoW and PoS issuance, with the EIP1559 burn, and accounts for the deprecation of PoW. Positive values 🟢 represent a net inflationary period (the typical condition), and negative values 🔴 indicate a net supply contraction (ETH supply deflation).\nSimulated Continuation of the PoW blockchain 🟠, assumes the PoS Merge never took place and assumes 2 ETH issued per block (uncle rewards ignored for simplicity).\nSimulated PoS only chain 🔵, assumes the Merge took place alongside the EIP1559 release in August 2021, and thus ignores all PoW block rewards after that date. This trace now aligns with the post-Merge area chart.\n\nIt can be seen that the PoS model 🔵 sports a dramatically lower issuance rate of ~772 ETH/day, compared to ~12.5k ETH for the PoW model 🟠. However, it is noted that net ETH issuance is, at present, still inflationary. This is primarily a result of extremely low blockchain congestion, and low network utilization at the moment.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nZooming into the 1-hour chart from the Merge event onwards, we can calculate the net supply reduction that has taken place. Between the Merge and the time of writing (~4-days after the fact):\n\nThe PoW Ethereum chain would have issued approximately 48.4k ETH on net.\nThe PoS chain has issued 3,893 ETH on net, reflecting a remarkable 92.8% reduction relative to the deprecated system.\n\nImmediately following the Merge event, a burst of blockspace demand did push average gas fees higher, which created an initial 12-hour period of net ETH supply deflation. However, as congestion cleared, and fees reverted lower, the overall ETH supply has continued to increase, albeit at a dramatically smaller rate compared to the previous PoW implementation.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe Ethereum Merge was a success, and a historic one to say the least. Many years of dedicated research, development, and strategy have now come together to achieve a remarkable engineering feat.\n\nThe world of on-chain analysis now has a plethora of new metrics to explore and describe the new consensus mechanism and performance of the second largest crypto-asset. Of these, the new supply dynamics are of particular interest, as the tension and market forces between new validators coming online (which increase issuance), and network congestion fee burn via EIP1559 lean towards either an inflationary, or a deflationary ETH supply.\n\nBe sure to check out our newest Proof-of-Stake Dashboards:\n\nProof-of-Stake Consensus\nProof-of-Stake Supply Dynamics\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReleased a large set of Derivatives, Supply, and Market Indicator Workbench Pre-sets for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\nWe are also proud to have launched new social channels for:\n\nSpanish (Analyst: @ElCableR, Telegram, Twitter)\nPortuguese (Analyst: @pins_cripto, Telegram, Twitter)\nTurkish (Analyst: @wkriptoofficial, Telegram, Twitter)\nFarsi (Analyst: @CryptoVizArt, Telegram, Twitter)\n--\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Rally Off the Bear Market Lows\n\nAfter the market rejected a rally to $24.5k, Bitcoin prices have dropped to $18.5k setting the second lowest low of the bear cycle. This has plunged over 11.8% of the supply back into an unrealized loss, allowing us to survey the risk of downside, and the possibility of bottom formation.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nSep 12, 2022 • 11 min read\n\nBitcoin markets have experienced a powerful rally, bouncing off the second lowest low ($18,649) of the prevailing bear market. Prices peaked at $21,758, but remain firmly within the consolidation range which has now been established for more than three months.\n\nSince mid-August, the market has been trading down from the consolidation rage high, which peaked at around $24.5k. As the market reaches towards the range low this week, we have an opportunity to observe the volume of coins that flipped from an unrealized profit (at $24.5k) to an unrealized loss through this process. These moments provide valuable insight on to the degree of coin accumulation, and cost basis concentration within an established consolidation range.\n\nIn this edition, we will zoom in on this concept of on-chain cost basis, and changing coin profitability. We will also analyze a very rare event, where three ~5k BTC whale sized transactions, aged 7y-10y, were spent over recent weeks. These coins were accumulated back in Dec-2013, realizing over $163M in profit.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian, Vietnamese and Greek.\n\nWe are also proud to have launched new social channels for:\n\nSpanish (Analyst: @ElCableR, Telegram, Twitter)\nPortuguese (Analyst: @pins_cripto, Telegram, Twitter)\nTurkish (Analyst: @wkriptoofficial, Telegram, Twitter)\nFarsi (Analyst: @CryptoVizArt, Telegram, Twitter)\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nDiscounts Across the Board\n\nBitcoin has now been within a persistent market downtrend for ten months since the ATH in November 2021. This week, Bitcoin spot prices touched the $18,649 level, marking the second lowest local low at a 72.5%  drawdown from the cycle top. Compared to prior bear cyclical bottoms, the 2022 contraction has not been as significant on a percent drawdown perspective. The lows in 2015, 2018 and 2020 reached over 77%+ drawdowns from ATH.\n\nHowever, even with a lower drawdown magnitude, the scale of financial loss in this bear market can be reasonably argued to be the largest in history (covered in our June Report).\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIn this edition, we will assess the current market structure using a framework, of weighing spot prices against the cost basis of distinct cohorts of market participants:\n\nOverall Market (MVRV) 🟠: Measuring the ratio of spot price and the on-chain cost basis of all investors in the market\nLong-Term Holders (LTH-MVRV) 🔵:  Calculates MVRV considering only Long-Term Holders, owning coins older than 155 days on average, and statistically the least likely to spend.\nShort-Term Holders (STH-MVRV) 🔴: Calculates MVRV considering only Short-Term Holders, owning coins younger than 155 days on average, and statistically the most likely to spend.\n\nHistorically, bottoming formation coincides with spot prices trading below all three of the aforementioned cost basis (i.e. MVRV < 1.0, WoC 25). This indicates a point in time where all cohorts are, in aggregate, holding an unrealized loss 🟪.\n\nThe current bear market has spent 56 days in this condition, despite a brief bounce back above the Realized Price and Long-Term Holder variant. Compared to the typical duration of ~190-days below the Realized Price in previous bear markets, 56-days remains a relatively short period of time.\n\nIn line with our June report, the lowest STH-MVRV values recorded this cycle are lower than during the Dec 2018 capitulation, suggesting that Short-Term Holders in particular, have experienced a historically large degree of financial pain.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nNext, we can compare the average acquisition price per coin for the STH cohort (🔴) against the LTH average acquisition price (🔵), to compare financial stress levels. Throughout the bear, persistent price depreciation leads the STH Realized Price to fall below the LTH Realized Price 🟪.\n\nSuch events only occur during the late stage of bear markets, and denote periods where the average cost of acquisition over the past 155 days, is now more advantageous than the average long-term holder cost basis. This is synonymous with a capitulation, where coins purchased near the cycle top are sold and change hands at much lower prices.\n\nDespite a 10-month downtrend, this bear market has not yet reached this cross-over stage. Previous bears took between 145 days and 339 days to recover after such a cross-over. by Given the trajectory of these two realized price traces, we can expect a cross-over by mid-September.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nThe market recently rejected the rally above $24.5k, giving us an opportunity to observe the volume of coins that have fallen from profit, back into an unrealized loss.\n\nCore Concept: Sharp price moves off the highs or lows of a consolidation range can be exceptionally rich in analysis value. These events highlight the volume of coins which swapped between holding an unrealized profit to an unrealized loss (or vice-versa). Metrics like Percent Supply in Profit can therefore be used to measure the volume of coins which changed hands within that concentrated price range.\n\nSince mid-August, the total Percent Supply in Loss jumped by 11.8%, reaching 48.1%. As shown in the figure below, the contribution of Short-Term Holders 🟥 (9.3%) is significantly higher than Long-Term Holders 🟦 (2.5%). This difference highlights the rising momentum of capital inflow in the period since spot prices crashed below the Realized Price in early Jun.\n\nIn other words, this high concentration of STH coins between $24k and $18.5k shows that 9.3% of the coin supply has recently transacted, suggesting both capitulation, and an equivalent demand inflow within this price range. It also highlights a risk, in that a large volume of investor coins (48.1% of supply) are underwater below $18.5k, and 11.8% of supply has a cost basis between $18.5k and $24.5k.\n\nLive Professional Metric\n\nNext, we will explore the Realized Profit/Loss Ratio metric, which measures the ratio between the volume of coins moved in profit, to those coins that are transferred in loss. Tracking the monthly average of this metric enables analysts to gauge shifts in market momentum, and sentiment, and to characterise the dominant profile of coins which are on the move.\n\nProfit Dominant Regime>1 🟩: At the early stages of the bull markets, where new demand is strong enough to adsorb selling pressure, and profits are taken at scale. This metric has historically recorded a sharp cross over the 1.0 level in early bull phases.\nLoss Dominant Regime < 1 🟥: During the extended phase of the bear markets, where the supply is not met with sufficient demand until the ultimate capitulation takes place. This indicator typically collapses and remains below 1.0 mid-way through a bear but is usually before capitulation, providing an early warning signal.\n\nThe interval between dropping below, and reclaiming the 1.0 level, is where bearish sentiment is at its peak, and due to inadequate demand liquidity. From a qualitative standpoint, the current Low Liquidity regime began ~4 months ago, and can be compared to the 6-month period experienced in the 2018-2019 bear.\n\nAn interesting observation is the upward trend which initiated in early June, and peaked in mid-August, having since descended to 0.58. This pattern reconfirms that an uptick in profit taking took place by investors during that relief rally (explored more in WoC 35).\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Realized Profit/Loss Ratio (30DMA) breaking above 1.0 could signal recovery of investor profitability, and signal a constructive influx of new demand.\n\nLive Advanced Metric\nNew Content: Before The Merge - Analyzing the Ethereum Beacon Chain\n\nThe #Ethereum Merge is now on the horizon, expected to happen this week. In our latest collaboration with CoinMarketCap, we explore a suite of new Proof-of-Stake metrics to detail network performance. Read our new report profiling the Beacon Chain.\n\nBefore The Merge - Analyzing the Ethereum Beacon Chain\nBear Market Volatility\n\nThe picture portrayed so far highlights the significant role of Short-Term Holder behavior in recent price moves. Therefore, as a key cohort of interest, assessment of STH spending is paramount for identifying a resilient bottom formation. A core tool to examine Short-Term Holders’ profitability is the Short-Term Holder SOPR, indicating the average profit multiple on spent coins.\n\nThe STH-SOPR structure provides a strong compass for mapping different bear market stages:\n\nA) Post-ATH Phase 🟥: The heavy loss realization after the ATH bubble bursts manifests as an abrupt plunge to levels below 1, usually followed by a volatile market regime.\n\nB) Bear Market Rallies 🟦: As the bear market progresses, a fragile equilibrium forms as a by-product of weak demand, and new supply as holders seek exit liquidity. This stage is set for numerous bear market rallies, peaking at various profit and loss levels, but all ultimately failing to sustain breaks higher.\n\nC) Post-Capitulation 🟨: As the time component of bear markets starts to exhaust investors psychologically, the potential of a capitulation event rises accordingly. Following this wash-out, a period of recovering profitability, and a SOPR uptrend often follows.\n\nThe June 2022 sell-off has many similarities to phase C, and the recent $24k rejection showed a convincing underside retest of STH-SOPR = 1.0, showing investors sold at their cost basis. Underside rejections like this are typical of bear market formation patterns.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Short-Term Holder SOPR and/or aSOPR breaking above 1.0 could signal a recovery of investor profitability and an improvement in underlying market strength.\n\nLive Professional Metric\n\nWe can use the STH Supply Profit/Loss Ratio metric to assess the behavior of STHs during the transition from a bear to a bull market. This indicator measures the ratio of STH unspent coins in profit to those in the loss, a similar idea to SOPR, however, using unspent (held) coins rather than spent coins.\n\nWe can identify extremes in short-term holder market conditions:\n\nSTH-Supply Profit/Loss Ratio > 1 🟩: During bull markets, more than half of short-term holders’ supply stays in profit, leading this ratio to fluctuate above 1. Higher values indicate a larger incentive for profit taking.\nSTH-Supply Profit/Loss Ratio < 1 🟥: Throughout bear markets, this ratio trades below 1 since the short-term holder supply is primarily in loss. Lower values indicate a larger probability of capitulation and where capitulation has taken place, preceding a strong recovery upwards.\n\nUtilizing the 1.0 level as a reference point, we can anticipate potential pivot points for counter-trend events, such as bull market corrections, or bear market rallies. The recent rejection by the $24k level (❌) was an example of a possible turning point for the bear market rally, which failed to gain momentum. However note the ascending lows of late, which is similar in structure to STH-SOPR, suggesting a slow, but observable recovery could be underway.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Short-Term Holder Supply Profit/Loss Ratio breaking above 1.0 could signal a recovery of investor profitability, and an improvement in underlying market strength.\n\nLive Professional Metric\nOld Whales Come Back to Life\n\nBitcoin bear markets have the ability to flush out even the most steadfast investors. This regime of Low Profitability for LTHs can be observed via LTH-SOPR. Historically, a sharp break back above 1 has signalled the transition back to bullish momentum in the market.\n\nCompared to 11 months of Low Profitability in the 2018-19 bear market 🟥, the current market has LTH-SOPR trading below 1 for just 4 months. Occasionally, we can observe an abrupt spike higher in LTH-SOPR 🟦. These sudden spikes are usually attributed to the transfer of a large volume of older coins, which realize historically large profits.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Long-Term Holder SOPR breaking above 1.0 could signal a recovery of investor profitability, and an improvement in underlying market strength.\n\nLive Professional Metric\n\nGenerally, decoding these events requires detailed investigation via detailed blockchain data science. In the next section, we will detail an analysis associated with the recent expenditure of three UTXOs, which contained over 5,000 BTC each, were all acquired in December 2013, and when bitcoin prices were $543.\n\nFirst, to underline the significance of the recent bounce in LTH-SOPR, we can refer to the following chart presenting the daily spent volume of 7-10 Years old coins. Remarkably, there are only 11 instances in history where the daily volume of 7y-10y old coins crossed over 4k BTC/day, with three of them in the last two weeks.\n\nLive Advanced Metric\n\nThe highlighted transactions can be characterized as follows:\n\nA- Block # 751518, 28-Aug-2022 ($19.6k), Spending 5,000 BTC (1,500 BTC to an unknown receiver and 3,500 BTC to Kraken), Original Purchase Date: 19-Dec-2013 ($543.14)\nB- Block # 751723, 29-Aug-2022 ($20.2k), Spending 5,000 BTC (BTC split to 170 addresses in one transaction), Original Purchase Date: 19-Dec-2013 ($543.14)\nC- Block # 752637, 04-Sep-2022 ($19.9k), Spending 5,000 BTC (the immediate receiver of the transaction is Kraken), Original Purchase Date: 19-Dec-2013 ($543.14)\n\nTherefore, the sudden peak in LTH-SOPR above was most likely attributed to these three old large wallets that realized a massive volume of profit by moving their funds acquired in late 2013. The following chart shows the two of these transactions which deposited funds into Kraken, realizing a total of $163.48M in profit on the 8.5k BTC sent directly to Kraken.\n\nLive Advanced Metric\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWith Bitcoin trading 72.5% below the Nov 2021 ATH this week, the market has many similarities to the latest phase of the 2018-19 bear market. The recent bear market rally sold off from $24.5k down to below $18.5k, plunging a significant volume of short-term holder supply back into an unrealized loss.\n\nAll in all, the primary factors influencing the current market structure appear to be these short-term holders, whom are jostling for the best entry price, and what little profit is available to take. The sensitivity and conviction of these investors within the volatile macroeconomic environment is a key factor in near-term market direction. Long-Term Holders have experienced a significant wash-out already and generally shift towards keeping coins dormant during these phases.\n\nThe recent bear market rally failed to achieve escape velocity, as shown by rejections across numerous SOPR and investor profitability ratios. Inflows of demand have proven insufficient to date to absorb this sell-side pressure. The battle is now in defence of the $20k region, noting that bear market history often takes several months before the final touches on a bear market floor are established.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReleased a large set of Derivatives, Supply, and Market Indicator Workbench Pre-sets for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Trial by Fire\n\nAmidst a persistent contraction in global liquidity, Bitcoin Short-Term Holders find themselves under immense pressure, with Bitcoin markets struggling to hold the psychological $20k support level.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nSep 5, 2022 • 10 min read\n\nLiquidity across all asset markets continue to fade this week, as persistent dollar strength pushes the DXY Index to a new 20-year high of 110.27. The Eurozone finds itself under increasing stress, with the balance of trade in deficit, concerns over energy shortages, and the Euro falling deeper below USD parity.\n\nWith weakness in almost all other currency pairs, the pressure remains on equities, bonds and Bitcoin markets alike. For Bitcoin specifically, the underlying market very much resembles the macro scene, with a volatile and uncertain short-term, whilst the longer-term outlook is more consistent, and characterized by well developed trends.\n\nIn this edition, we shall explore this dichotomy from the lens of market spending behaviors, inspecting regions of local distribution, within a macro scale accumulation regime. We shall supplement this assessment with more granular deep dives into various cohorts, including HODLers, Short-Term Holders, and by different wallet sizes to understand their isolated stress levels.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Arabic, Russian and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nLocal Distribution\n\nTo begin, we shall assess the degree of accumulation / distribution occurring in response to the current price range. The Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score can be used to understand participant spending behavior, and help contextualize the market response to price action.\n\nIn the last 12-months, we have seen four distinct phases:\n\nPhase 1 (Accumulation): Following the capture of a new ATH in Nov 2021, investor elation translated into perfect accumulation scores, as the market readily bought what they believed to be an opportune dip.\nPhase 2 (Distribution): A slow, but sustained collapse in price left the recent accumulators severely in loss. This sparked a transition in emotion from elation to desperation, as underwater participants distributed coins, as the bear market reality started to set in.\nPhase 3 (Accumulation): The LUNA Collapse rippled across the heavily entangled leverage throughout the industry, prompting a unilateral, and wide-scale deleveraging event. Despite plunging the already weak market to new lows, participants reacted by transitioning into near broad scale accumulation throughout both capitulation legs below $30k, and then again below $20k.\nPhase 4 (Distribution): Following months of accumulation, the market managed to rally above $24k, however as covered in WoC 34 and WoC 35, this opportunity for exit liquidity was taken via distribution, and profit taking.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can further isolate this behavior by cohorts, to assess the primary participants in each regime.\n\nThe cohort of most interest in the current market are the Whales (10k+ BTC) who have begun to aggressively distribute coins into the range highs of $24500, capitalizing on any exit liquidity present amidst global market uncertainty.\n\nThe excess supply provided to the Market by the Whales appears to have overwhelmed the already eroded demand side, culminating in the formation of a local top.\n\nLive Metric in the Glassnode Engine Room\n\nWe can confirm this behavior using the Whale-Exchange Net Position Change metric. This tool allows us to see the 30-day net change in Whale balances (1k BTC+), considering only coins flowing in and out of exchanges.\n\nPositive values (🟢) indicate net Whale balance growth (and exchange withdrawals).\nNegative values (🔴) indicate net Whale balance decline (and exchange deposits).\n\nA stark reversal can be noted following the sell-off to $17.6k, where Whale transfers rapidly reversed towards net deposits to exchanges. Peak distribution was hit around the recent local top of $24.5k. This provides confluence with the results from the cohort analysis above, with the 10k+ cohort seen to be the dominant actor.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nMacro Accumulation\n\nTransitioning from a local time horizon to a macro perspective, we shall next assess the levels of accumulation / distribution occurring over a multi-year time frame\n\nTo assess the macro state of Bitcoin long-term behavior, we initially can turn to the Liveliness metric. Liveliness measures aggregate network activity by balancing the all-time aggregate Coin Day Destruction against all-time Coin Day Creation. The trend and gradient of it then provide information on wider market preferences for HODLing (downtrends) or spending (uptrends).\n\nLiveliness is currently in a strong downtrend, and has convincingly broken below the triple peaks of the post 2018 bear market. This event suggests that Coin Days are being accumulated by the supply much faster than they are being destroyed, and is coincident with a HODLing dominant regime.\n\nLive Advanced Metric\n\nNext, we can inspect a derivative of Liveliness that brings it into the supply domain; the HODLer Net Position Change. This metric can be used to assess an implied monthly change to HODLed supply, with two notable phase shifts during this market cycle:\n\nPrice appreciation from Nov 2020 to Apr 2021 triggered a large scale HODLer distribution event, with long-term investors distributing at a peak rate of -150k BTC per month.\nThis period of distribution has been currently balanced by HODLer accumulation throughout the second half of 2021 to present. Currently, we are seeing a position change of +70k BTC per month, the largest monthly HODLer position change since March 2020.\n\nAssessing the period from Nov 2020 to present day, we can observe that macro HODLing behaviour is at a multi-year high, reaching 70k BTC/month, and aligning with a longer-term conviction (even whilst price action remains dire).\n\nLive Professional Metric\n\nWe can now critique the net effects of the two above described regimes. We can calculate the net supply change for the HODLer cohort since Nov 2020, at the start of the 2020-21 bull cycle, to observe the net HODLer inflows and outflows.\n\nPhase 1: From Nov 2020 to May 2021 saw a cumulative outflow of -394k BTC in a few short months, as HODLer’s aggressively spent coins and took profits.\nPhase 2: From May 2021 to Present, a cumulative inflow of +394k BTC can be observed, effectively replenishing the previous distribution phase.\n\nThe aggressive period of distribution used to propel the initial 2021 bull run has been effectively counterbalanced by a consistent period of HODLer accumulation, spanning almost twice the duration of the distribution regime. This effectively describes an 'exuberance detox', which largely aligns with an expulsion of all Bitcoin tourists, a concept we started profiling in WoC 27.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nWe can support these observations from the ‘implied supply domain’, with observations from the measured Long-Term Holder (LTH) Supply. LTH Supply has seen an uptick of +250k BTC since the recent decline in supply, pushing the total balance to just 30k BTC shy of the ATH.\n\nThe coin age threshold to be considered LTH supply is approximately 155-days, putting the minimum acquisition date in early April 2022. This threshold currently sits within the peak of the aforementioned Phase 2 distribution phase, at a price around $46k, and just before the LUNA inspired sell-off took hold.\n\nThus it is possible that LTH supply slows and stagnates in the coming month, perhaps until mid-October where the threshold will be post-LUNA and well within the Phase 3 accumulation period.\n\nLive Professional Metric\n\nWe can also compare LTH supply to the number of Accumulation Addresses, and to Illiquid Supply to gain a more comprehensive view of potential changes to supply dynamics. Note that Illiquid supply is defined as coins held in wallets with little, or no history of spending. Accumulation addresses are those which have received more than two payments, but have never spent.\n\nSTH-to-LTH threshold is shown on the chart below. This threshold aligns with an explosive increase in both Accumulation Addresses, as well as a ramp up in momentum for Illiquid Supply. Also note that both metrics have largely continued to push to new highs ever since.\n\nThis adds weight to a case that LTH supply may continue to push higher over coming months, which would provide confluence with the HODLer regime denoted by network Liveliness.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nIn the face of seemingly endless market uncertainty, the HODLer class are resolute in their conviction. Short of a significant reversal in LTH Supply, Liveliness, or HODLer Net position change, the longer-term prospects for Bitcoin actually remain quite constructive.\n\nThus we turn our attention to the near-term Short-Term Holder cohort, who by deduction, are more likely to be driving recent weakness in prices.\n\nShort-Term Stress Test\n\nThe Entity-Adjusted URPD is below, and presents the supply distribution split into STH (red) and LTH (blue) supply. Here we can identify an extreme concentration of STH supply around the current price, reflecting recent acquisitions, and day to day trade volume.\n\nHowever, following with recent drop in price, the majority of the STH Supply is now holding an unrealized loss, hurling this cohort into a severe degree of financial stress.\n\nLive Metric in the Glassnode Engine Room\n\nBy inspecting the percent supply in profit, we can supplement the thesis that the majority of transactions within the current price regions are propagated by STH cohort. By comparing the percentage change for the supply in profit between two price points, insight is provided into the the total number of BTC “trapped” within the select range.\n\nTherefore, we can observe that 13.3% of the circulating supply lost their profitable status during the move downwards from $24k to $19.6k. This suggests that 2.55M (13.3%) of the circulating supply last transacted within this price range.\n\nLive Advanced Metric\n\nThis stress is echoed in absolute terms by the Short-Term Holder Supply in Loss. Here we can see that 1.53M STH owned coins fell below their break-even price during the move down from $24.4k.\n\nThus 1.53M out of 2.55M (60%) coins trapped within the aforementioned range are represented by Short-Term Holders. This is a disproportionate representation for a cohort with only a 16% share of the circulating supply, further demonstrating the movement of coins in this region is Short-Term Holder dominated.\n\nLive Professional Metric\n\nWe can bolster the above observation with the percentage of Short-Term Holder Supply in Loss. The recent move from the local top of $24k plunged 50% of the aggregate STH Supply into loss in the span of just a few days.\n\nThis bring STH Supply in loss close almost to full saturation, with 96% of the STH Supply now underwater on their holdings. Full loss saturation has occurred three times within the prevailing downtrend, which interestingly marked local bottom formation events. This is in effect a result of capitulation, as sellers transfer coins to new STH buyers, who put in a local bottom, and then return to profit upon any meaningful price recovery.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nWith HODLer conviction remaining steadfast, the onus now falls to the Short-Term Holders to hold the line, as the market is clearly testing their resolve. It appears that the majority of daily trade volume and churn is being driven by recent buyers, as they jostle for the best entry.\n\nPlunge Protection\n\nGiven the somewhat dire price action of late, and a high concentration of trigger happy STHs in the current price range, the chances of another capitulation event are non-trivial. Thus, it is prudent to prepare for all outcomes, and in the event of further price slippage, we can consult two pricing models hovering below the market:\n\nThe Balanced Price metric attempts to capture a fair value model for BTC. This is produced by calculating the difference between Realized Price (the aggregate sum paid for all coins) and the Transfer Price (the cumulative USD value of Coin Days Destroyed).\nThe Difficulty Regression Price attempts to model the all-in cost of production for Bitcoin mining, calculated by running a log-log regression model between Difficulty and Market Cap.\n\nBoth models supported the 1 hour wick during the capitulation to the current cycle low, and are currently providing a confluence of support at the $17k mark. Therefore, the two models pricing may be considered an area of interest, and a fundamentally derived area of support in the event of further market weakness.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe global bear market remains in full effect with price continuing to linger above range lows. Periods of price elation have been met with aggressive distribution from the largest of investor classes, as the search for exit liquidity persists. However, macro accumulation over a multi-year scale remains in effect, with HODLers and Long-Term Holders seemingly unfazed by prevailing economic conditions.\n\nWith HODLer conviction resolute, the market has begun to stress test its statistically weakest hands, the Short-Term Holders. This cohort has been the primary proponent of day-to-day acquisitions within the current price range, culminating in a large concentration of coins clustered around the current market value.\n\nThe most recent move lower in price action has lead to a large majority of the Short-Term Holder supply suffering unrealized losses. Thus, Short-Term Holders find themselves heavily questioned by the market in a Trial by Fire. Two outcomes remains, capitulation through heat, or a cohort emboldened, hardened by the very flames who questioned them.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nNewNew ETH breakdown metrics: Gas Usage, Vanilla Transactions, Stablecoins Transactions, ERC20, DeFI, NFTs, Bridges\nReleased new Uncharted 22 dashboard Newsletter.\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nBitcoin Barely Hanging On\n\nNear-term weakness continues to haunt numerous Bitcoin fundamentals, with prices faltering amidst minimal excess sell-side pressure. Investors who are spending appear to be taking advantage of any and all exit liquidity offered.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nAug 29, 2022 • 8 min read\n\nIt has been another tough week for asset markets, with Bitcoin, equities, forex, and bond markets experiencing volatility, and general price depreciation. The Euro has once again traded below USD parity as the European energy crisis worsens, and the DXY Dollar Index has punched up to a new twenty year high above 109.30.\n\nWith the US Federal Reserve governors continuing to signal a hawkish stance on inflation at Jackson Hole, Bitcoin, as a developing index for global liquidity, reacted accordingly. Prices traded lower this week, coming off a high of $21,781, and hitting a multi-week low of $19,611.\n\nIn this edition, we will continue our assessment from last week (WoC 34), exploring how near-term weakness continues to be visible across many Bitcoin fundamental metrics. This creates a condition where prices are trading lower, even with very little additional sell-side pressure on-chain. This continues to signal both persistently weak demand, as well as an investor base who is willing to take whatever exit liquidity the market offers them, to 'get their money back' at cost.\n\n🔔 Alert Ideas are presented throughout to help identify key metric levels of interest that may signify significant shifts in market/network performance. Any Glassnode member can set an alert directly from Glassnode Studio.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Russian, Arabic and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nFalling In the Breeze\n\nWe will start our assessment from the lens of lifespan metrics, which broadly describe the age of coins that are being spent on-chain. Generally speaking:\n\nLower lifespan values signify younger coins dominate transactions. It is usually encountered as the bear market grinds lower, and speculators are purged from the market.\nHigher lifespan values signify older coins dominate transactions. It is usually experienced during bull markets as profits are taken, but also during bearish capitulation events, due to panic selling.\n\nASOL tracks the average age per spent output, but ignores coin volume. It has been in a macro decline since Jan 2021, coincident with the prevailing bear. It spiked higher over recent weeks, as a group of older coins were spent, however this was only for a fleeting moment.\n\nWeak price action without a sustained trend higher in ASOL signifies that the available demand can barely hold up the day to day sell-side pressure, let alone additional spending by profit takers and/or capitulation events was to take place.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nWe can further inspect this by looking at Dormancy, which is the average age per unit coin moved. This metric does account for spent coin volume. Here we can see that the average age per coin is near multi-year lows, which means the ASOL spike was actually very light on BTC volume, bolstering the observation of very weak demand for Bitcoin.\n\nIf prices were climbing, this would be a very constructive signal, as it shows older coins are staying dormant. As it stands, however, this indicates the reverse, whereby prices are still struggling to hold the line even with older coins staying put in investor wallets.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAt a macro scale, the Coin-Years Destroyed metric continues to push lower, reaching a relatively significant low. This metric aggregates the total lifespan destroyed (in years) over the last 365-days, and similar to dormancy, low levels are usually constructive and typical of late stage bear markets.\n\nIt remains plausible that the Bitcoin market is trading within what may become a longer-term bottom formation pattern. However, it is clear that the market is only just hanging on at present and is far from out of the woods yet.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nTo really hammer home this point of fundamental weakness, we can top it off with the Active Entities chart below. This metric can be considered analogous to 'unique daily active users' of the Bitcoin network, and it is currently testing the lower end of the long-standing Bear Market Channel.\n\nThis indicates that there is little growth in the active user-base, and the network is currently trafficked by the bare minimum user base we would consider to be within 'historical bounds.' Should Active entities decline much further, it would suggest an unfortunate deterioration of the user base, and enter a zone of aggregate weakness which has not been seen for many years.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Active Entities (7DMA) breaking below 230k/day could signal a deterioration in on-chain activity, whilst a break above 250k/day could signal an influx of new user demand.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nTo end this first section on a slightly brighter note, it is quite clear that no widespread loss of HODLer conviction has taken place. The decline in lifespan metrics actually bodes well for the longer-term, as it indicates old coins are stationary, and declining prices have little psychological impact on this cohorts' conviction.\n\nWhilst the resolve of the strong hands remains rock solid, it simply appears that their available demand inflows have not yet rebuffed the bears, who have driven the bulls back to the $20k line.\n\nNew Glassnode Content: Market Pulse\n\nWe are pleased to launch a new series of analysis content, available exclusively for Glassnode members. The Market Pulse is a weekly series hosted and discussed on Glassnode Forum, where our analysts explore advanced topics, and Workbench creations in greater detail.\n\nAn Update on Bitcoin Utility\nUnderstanding Lifespan, Spent Outputs, and Spent Volumes\nAnalysis of Network Participants by Means and Medians\nSold At Break Even Prices\n\nIn the section above, we established that the current Bitcoin user base performance is lacklustre at best, and that price action remains remarkably weak, even as older coin expenditure declines. To make matters worse, investor psychology appears to be one that is keen to simply 'get my money back,' with a great degree of spending taking place at and around their cost basis.\n\nIn aggregate, Bitcoin investors are realizing around $220M/day in net losses. On a relative scale, this is quite modest in magnitude, especially relative to recent multi-billion dollar capitulation events. However, even with this relatively light capital outflow of $220M/day, the bulls are fighting an uphill battle.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Net Realized Profit/Loss (30DMA) breaking above Zero would signal that net spending is back in profit, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nLooking at the aSOPR metric, we can observe the average profit (or loss) multiple on spent coins. Generally speaking, an aSOPR value near 1.0 is of heightened interest:\n\naSOPR of 1.0 in a bullish trend 🟢 often acts as support, as investors buy the dip and add to their position at or around their cost basis. This also signifies profitable coins prefer to stay dormant, reducing sell-side pressure at the lows.\naSOPR of 1.0 in a bearish trend 🔴 often acts as resistance, as investors sell the rally and offload their position at or around their cost basis. Psychologically this reflects a mentality of 'getting my money back' on whatever exit liquidity the market offers.\n\nThe recent sell-off was initiated after a convincing underside retest of 1.0 at a time where prices reached above $24k. Rejection from this level largely confirms weakness lay on the road ahead, as investors took the exit liquidity and spent coins around their acquisition cost basis.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: aSOPR (7DMA) breaking above 1.0 would signal that aggregate spending is back in profit, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nBitcoin Long-Term Holders are also feeling the pinch, with LTH-SOPR values trading around 0.60 to 0.65 for several consecutive weeks. This indicates that investors who have held their coins for at least 5-months, and are statistically the least likely to spend, are locking in losses between -35% and -40% on average. Buyers from the 2021-22 cycle continue to exit their positions at a meaningful loss.\n\nWhilst not as severe as the -50% peak losses in 2018 (to date), this current bear market competes meaningfully with the worst bears of the past on the basis of most damage done. A meaningful recovery of LTH-SOPR above 1.0 would be a constructive signal, however has historically taken a number of months to achieve this escape velocity.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: LTH-SOPR (7DMA) breaking above 1.0 would signal that Long-Term Holder spending is back in profit, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nFinally, we close out with an aggregate view of recent on-chain losses, where we can see that the scale of capital outflow over the last month is historic. Surpassed only by the 2018 capitulation, the relative magnitude of investor losses in recent weeks is enormous, hitting 0.28% of the Market Cap per day.\n\nGiven this reality, it should be of little surprise that investors are willing to take whatever rallies and profits they can get.\n\nLive Professional Chart in the Glassnode Engine Room\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe 2022 bear market carries on and has clearly taken a toll on the aggregate Bitcoin investor base. Despite not seeing any widespread loss of conviction amongst the HODLers, as signalled by lifespan metrics in decline, the bulls still cannot establish a meaningful uptrend.\n\nThe psychology of investor spending patterns remains firmly in the bear market territory, as rallies are sold, and exit liquidity is taken at or around cost basis levels. Given the current remarkably low active user base, it could be considered impressive that the $20k level has held up to date.\n\nIt remains plausible that Bitcoin is in a bottom formation range and would be historically similar to all past bear markets. However, Bitcoin prices are just barely hanging on, and any uptick in the fundamentals would be a welcome change.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nManually updated the labels for BinancePool, Poolin, BTC.com and AntPool.\nNew Metric Releases: US Year-over-Year Supply Change, EU Year-over-Year Supply Change and Asia Year-over-Year Supply Change\nReleased new Uncharted 22 dashboard Newsletter.\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

However, weakness in the underlying network activity has manifested as a sell-off this week, with prices falling once again below this key cost basis level.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nAug 22, 2022 • 9 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin markets recently experienced a wave of short relief, with prices trading above the Realized Price for 23 consecutive days. However, weakness in the underlying network activity covered in WoC 31 has manifested as a sell-off this week, with prices falling once again below this key cost basis level.\n\nThe Realized Price currently trading at $21.7k, while spot prices are slightly below the Realized Price at $21.3k. During the 2018-2019 bear market, prices fluctuated below the Realized Price for 140 days, making the prevailing bear market duration of 36 days relatively brief, and thus indicating more accumulation time may be required (as discussed in WoC 28).\n\nIn this edition, we will explore the underlying weakness leading to this weeks sell-off, alongside metrics to keep an eye on to support a more macro scale recovery.\n\n🔔 Alert Ideas are presented throughout to help identify key metric levels of interest that may signify significant shifts in market/network performance. Any Glassnode member can set an alert directly from Glassnode Studio.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Russian, Arabic and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nDiving Back Underwater\n\nWith the Realized Price now overhead, two additional on-chain price models sit below the market as potential support levels. Delta Price and Balanced Price are well-known on-chain models with a track record for converging with prices around cycle bottoms.\n\nDelta Price ($13,760 🟣) is a hybrid pricing model founded on both Technical and On-chain bases. It is calculated as the difference between the Realized and the all-time Average Prices. Delta price has previously caught the bottom wicks of bear markets.\nBalanced Price ($17,180 🔵)represents the difference between Realized Price and Transferred Price (coinday time-weighted price). This can be thought of as a form of 'fair value' model, capturing the difference between what was paid (cost-basis) and what was spent (transferred).\n\nThe chart below highlights the similarities between the current market structure and the bottom formation phase in 2018-2019.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nAn Opportunity For Distribution\n\nInitially, we will examine the Trend Accumulation Score by Cohort to provide granular insight into the accumulation/distribution behavior of all market participants separated by wallet size. Zooming in on the recent recovery from the local bottom in mid-Jun, we can observe two distinct phases:\n\nPhase A 🟡: After crashing below $20k, Shrimps (<1 BTC) and Whales (>10k BTC, excluding exchanges and miners) were net accumulators, while other investing classes showed a Balanced Regime.\nPhase B 🔴: Following the initial reclamation of the Realized Price, all cohorts seized the opportunity to distribute their coins. Interestingly Shrimps' persistent strong accumulation momentum (<1 BTC) has also weakened in this phase.\n\nTherefore, the recent price appreciation triggered a distribution phase across the board, adding sell pressure to the market.\n\nLive Professional Metric in the Engine Room\nTracking Demand via Network Activity\n\nFollowing the principles of Supply-Demand, the sustainability of a bear market rally can be critiqued when the Supply side is not balanced by new Demand and rising network activity.\n\nThe number of unique New Addresses which appeared for the first time is an effective tool to gauge the activity in the network. Due to intraday volatility in activity, the absolute value of new addresses on any given day can be uninformative. However, the trend of new addresses entering the market can provide a strong signal for network activity. Therefore, we shall compare the monthly average of new addresses against the yearly average to underline relative shifts in dominant sentiment and help identify the tides turning for network activity.\n\nBear Market Confirmation 🔴: Alongside prices plunging from the April 2021 ATH, the 30 DMA of the New Address fell sharply below the 365 DMA. This established confirmation that the bear market phase was likely in effect through the lens of network activity.\nNew Demand Confirmation 🟢: After a lengthy market consolidation phase, an abrupt spike of 30 DMA above 365 DMA for New Addresses has historically signalled a promising sign of new demand entering the market.\n\nExamining the recent spot price bounce above realized price shows that the monthly average of New Addresses is still lower than the yearly average 🟡. This pattern can be considered a validation of low demand in the market.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: New Addresses (30 SMA) breaking above 408k (365 SMA)  would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nProbing further into the demand side, Miner Revenue From Fees allows for evaluation of the competitiveness of Block space. This can be considered a measurement of network congestion and demand for inclusion in the next block.\n\nLow Demand 🔴: The early stages of bear market realization frequently coincide with the evaporation of fees from miners’ revenue. Here, the typical range of 2.5% to 5% has acted as a historical threshold between high and low demand in the market.\nHigh Demand 🟢: In contrast, a sustained entrance above the aforementioned 2.5%-5.0% range can be considered a constructive sign for assessing a new wave of demand.\n\nThe current structure of this metric demonstrates a low but noticeably rising level of demand for block space. Despite its simplicity, measuring the momentum of paid fees for total settled value is an insightful macro indicator for assessing the complex dynamics of increasing network demand.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Percent Miner Revenue From Fees (30 SMA) breaking above 2.5%  would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe presence of retail investors in the network can be gauged by analyzing the long-term trend of small transactions. The following chart displays the 90D moving average of the total volume of transactions with a USD value of less than $10K.\n\nAssuming small-size transactions are primarily attributed to retail investors, the quarterly smoothed average of this metric can be used to track the dominant sentiment of the market. Long-lasting bullish phases 🟩 are attractive to retail investors and bearish periods are less 🟥, so the trend of small transaction volumes can be used to gauge the market atmosphere.\n\nInterestingly, the recent positive movement towards $24.4k was not accompanied by any shift in retail-sized transfer volume or demand 🟦. This pattern adds additional confirmation of the underlying weakness of this market rally.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nLooking at the stacked Total Inflows & Outflows to All Exchanges (USD value), we can also extract a similar correlation between the cyclical behavior of Bitcoin prices and USD-denominated exchange inflows 🟥 and outflows 🟩. Exchange flows have now declined to multi-year lows, returning to late-2020 levels. Similar to the retail investor volumes, this suggests a general lack of speculative interest in the asset persists.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nTo establish an explicit indicator based on this connection between exchange flows and wider market sentiment, we defined a new metric, Exchange Flow Multiple. This metric equals the ratio between monthly averaged exchange flows and its yearly average value.\n\nExchange flows are defined as the average of USD-denominated inflow and outflow volumes related to all exchanges (i.e. inflows + outflows divided by 2).\n\nThe Exchange Flow Multiple can be used as a threshold level which can be used to map the early 🔴 and later stages 🟢 of a bear market. In agreement with previously discussed charts, the recent price comeback from the Jun 2022 bottom 🟦 was not accompanied by a significant influx of speculators into the market.\n\nThus, from the above observations, it appears the recent price rally had little substance behind it from an on-chain perspective and thus confirms the weakness we originally highlighted in WoC 31.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nShort-Term Holder Confidence\n\nMonitoring Network Demand and Activity with an emphasis on retail investors and speculators can provide insight into mapping the twilight stages of a bear market. However, to complete this puzzle, we will close with an evaluation of Short-Term Holders’ Confidence.\n\nThe current market structure does resemble past bottom formation patterns, as discussed in Week On-Chain 29 report. Generally nonspeaking, after a lengthy accumulation phase has taken place, any positive price movement tends to bolster the confidence of short-term investors with a cost basis near equivalent to market value.\n\nIn line with this, a sustainable bullish uptrend is usually accompanied by two macro shifts:\n\nDeclining Realized Losses as all remaining sellers are exhausted from the market.\nProfits Realized by Short-Term Holders as new demand absorbs sell-side pressure.\nDecreasing Realized Loss\n\nInvestigation of the 2018-2019 bear market shows that at the very final stages of bottom formation, the Net Realized Profit/Loss (90DMA) has gradually recovered to neutral, as the final sellers are exhausted from the market.\n\nWe use the Net Realized Profit/Loss (90DMA), looking for a structural decline in Realizing Net Losses 🔵. If it persists longer, this pattern pivots to Realizing Net Profits that the market can comfortably absorb. The current inclination towards net loss realization demonstrates the price vulnerability against any negative forces in the market.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Net Realized Profit/Loss (90 SMA) breaking above Zero would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nAbsorption of Profit Taking\n\nLooking at the Short-Term Holders SOPR (90DMA), we can see a quarterly-smoothed ratio of investor selling prices relative to buying prices. The important threshold level in this metric is a cross-over of 1.0, with a break above indicating a return to profitable spending.\n\nFollowing the capitulation from the November ATH, short-term holders (top buyers) realized heavy losses, causing a sharp drop in Short-Term Holders SOPR (90DMA) below 1 🟥.\n\nThis phase is usually followed by a period of low conviction, where the break-even value of 1 acts as overhead resistance. This occurs because investors are quite willing to sell at or around their cost basis to simply get their money back 🟡.\n\nFinally, after sufficient bottom accumulation takes place, a sustainable break above 1.0 often confirms that new capital is flowing into the market and is absorbing the profit taken by short-term holders 🟩.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: STH-SOPR (90 SMA) breaking above 1.0 would signal an uptick in on-chain profitability, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nIn this report, we have discussed the main factors that led to the weakness and subsequent rejection of the price from $24.4k back below the Realized Price. Investors from a variety of wallet-size cohorts decided to distribute during the recent rally above the market average cost basis level.\n\nThe recent price uptrend also failed to attract a significant wave of new active users, which is particularly noticeable amongst retail investors and speculators. The monthly momentum of exchange flows is also  not suggesting a new wave of investors entering the market, implying a relatively lacklustre influx of capital .\n\nThe current market structure is certainly comparable with the late-2018 bear market, however does not yet have the macro trend reversal in profitability and demand inflow required for a sustainable uptrend. Therefore, the ongoing cycle bottom consolidation phase is most likely, as Bitcoin investors attempt to lay a firmer foundation, subject of course to the persistent uncertainty and unfavourable events of the macroeconomic backdrop.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nManually updated the labels for BinancePool, Poolin, BTC.com and AntPool.\nNew Metric Releases: US Year-over-Year Supply Change, EU Year-over-Year Supply Change and Asia Year-over-Year Supply Change\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

In this edition, we explore how we can assess the migration of conviction by use of coin age bands.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nAug 15, 2022 • 9 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin Market continues its recent rally higher in conjunction with other risk assets in light of a deceleration of inflation prints. Bitcoin prices continue to consolidate within a range, but traded up from the lows of $22,789 to a high of $24,974.\n\nIn this weeks edition, we shall explore the Maturity Gauntlet. This is the maturation process of of BTC holdings in investor wallets. Generally, longer hold times signify improving odds of a higher conviction, and cost insensitive owner. After such a deep capitulation, we are seeking to characterize out who sold, and who stepped in at the lows.\n\nWe shall explore this concept by via the concept of Lifespan (coin age) and Supply Dynamics for both young and old coins across BTC, and USD denominated wealth bands. We will also dive into a study of  spending behaviors of Long Term and Short Term Holders to assess coin ownership as the dust begins to settle.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Russian, Arabic and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nExpansion in Maturity\n\nThe amount of supply that has been dormant for at least 1yr can be used to provide insight into the cyclical nature of Bitcoin through distribution and accumulation cycles.\n\nDistribution Cycles are a characteristic of a Bull Market, as the incentive to realize value increases for participants with mature coins. This leads to a reduction of 1yr+ old supply as coins are spent and sold.\nAccumulation Cycles are a characteristic of Bear Markets, as the magnitude of potential profit wanes alongside a collapse in price. HODLing gradually becomes the primary dynamic. This leads to an increase of supply older than 1yr.\n\nCurrently, Supply Active 1+ Years sits just below the previous ATH set in May 2022 at 65%. This highlights the significant conviction of May-July 2021 buyers after the great miner migration. The equilibrium over the last three months indicates that coin maturation is in balance with spending. This is can be considered a constructive mechanic within a bear market.\n\n🔔Alert Idea: Percent of Supply Last Active 1+ Years Ago breaking above 65.72% would signal a new ATH in supply dormant for a year, this suggest increased probability of a topping formation.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThis phenomena can be further inspected by isolating coins from the HODL Waves age bands of 6 Months to 3 Years. HODL waves provides insight into the volume of BTC held for at least a minimum duration, which provides a proxy for analyzing buyers from the 2020-22 cycle, many of whom are likely experiencing their first bear market cycle.\n\nThe 6m-12m band can be seen to expand post the Great Miner Migration as HODLers refused to sell at the lows, this supply swell coincides with a bottoming in supply active 1yr+ ago. Within a HODLer dominant regime, supply was able to mature leading to a swelling of the 1y-2y age band following the Nov 2021 ATH.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe Realized Cap HODL Waves can then be used to assess the USD wealth held in these same age bands. Here we can see an even more intriguing result, where overall USD value held in these cohorts has surged by 52%, now accounting for 63% of the Realized Cap.\n\nThe price insensitivity of the Smart Money cohort can be highlighted by this continued increase, which suggests minimal spending, and investors allowing held BTC to mature regardless of price appreciation (Nov 2021), and subsequent capitulation (May 2022 - Current).\nSmart Money can be seen to be in a structural uptrend expanding its USD wealth by 51% equivalent to a $220B increase culminating in a total balance of $267B.\nTherefore, 37% of the Circulating Supply (7M BTC) represents 63% of the network USD wealth (based on value at the time of acquisition) underscoring the relative economic weight of the cohort.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nBitcoin cycles are driven by an ever-evolving supply balance between longer-term investors, and newer speculative buyers. The RHODL Ratio distils this concept into an oscillator by comparing the USD wealth of 1 week old coins, to those held by the 1y-2y old cohort.\n\nThis can be considered under the following framework:\n\nAn uptrend in the RHODL Ratio suggests dominance of USD wealth held by new, speculative buyers, which is typical of peak speculation and Bitcoin market tops.\nA downtrend in the RHODL Ratio indicates dominance of USD wealth held by older coins, suggesting increased HODLing and long-term accumulation behavior.\nA flat, range bound RHODL Ratio indicates that the rate of change between old and young dominance is at an equilibrium. This a transition period. is often observed around market transition periods such as distributive markets tops and accumulation bottoms.\n\nCurrently, we are seeing the RHODL Ratio trade within a strong downtrend, confirming that the balance of USD wealth continues to shift back towards longer-term patient holders.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe Long-Term Holder Supply can then be employed to provide an assessment of the behavior of holders whom have a statistically higher conviction in the asset. Note that the 155-day threshold for LTH status 🔵 brings us to the March 2022 region, where price experienced the first post-ATH relief rally towards $46K.\n\nBy observing the total supply held by the Long-Term Holder cohort, we can make two observations:\n\nLTH Supply has been range bound between 13.56M to 13.27M BTC since the November 2021 ATH, declining by just 300K BTC.\nSince the Luna Sell off in May 2022, LTHs have seen a sustained decline in supply amounting to -150K BTC.\n\nRecent spending behavior by Long Term Holder is currently larger in coin volume than the HODLing from the pre-LUNA consolidation zone. This results in a modest, but observable decline in held supply.\n\nNote that LTH supply does not need to aggressively decline for the cohort to be experiencing a capitulation event under the surface. Historically, LTH supply tends to trade only slightly lower during such events as the weakest of the cohort are flushed out, and generally balanced by more resilient accumulation that takes time to mature.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nCompression and Contraction\n\nWhen considering the Circulating Supply for Bitcoin, we can inspect it from three components: the Long-Term, Short-Term, and Exchange held supply.\n\nBeginning with Exchange Balances, Exchanges continue to experiences a macro decline in supply held, with this trend developing since the March 2020 capitulation event. Year to date, exchange outflows have continued with generally increasing intensity as prices declined. This underscores a persistent structural demand, from both small and large investors, for sovereign self custodial assets.\n\nOn balance, Exchanges have seen a net outflow of -100K BTC following the May 2022 LUNA capitulation, which accounts for 3.2% of the total outflows since the March 2020 ATH.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nNext, we can assess the other two components held outside exchanges, the Long Term and Short Term Holder supply.\n\nAs discussed, LTH supply has seen a slight decline of -200K BTC since recording an ATH in May 2022 but remains effectively range bound over the last 12-months. This highlights a relatively balanced inflow/outflow dynamic for this cohort.\n\nOn the contrary, STH supply continues to expand following a capitulation in price leading to a supply increase of+330k BTC.\n\nSince the May collapse of LUNA, there has been a net transfer of -300k BTC from the combined LTHs, and exchanges, towards STHs. Given the accompanying price declines, this broadly describes a capitulation style event, as the swelling STH supply describes accumulation by buyers who stepped in during the flush out, and now own coins with a much lower cost basis.\n\nLive Workbench\nA Constructive Divergence\n\nBy definition, these coins were transferred into the Short-Term Holder cohort. Since the March 08 2020 LUNA collapse, STH supply increased by +330k BTC.\n\nExtreme STH accumulation is normally concurrent with bull market topping formations (marked in 🔵), however, a few bear market examples stand out against this trend (marked in 🔴):\n\nThe twin spikes of 300K+ inflows, which punctuated the start, and end of the 2015 bear market bottom.\nThe April to July 2019 relief rally out of the bear market lows.\nThe March 2020 capitulation event.\nThe June 2022 sell-off below the last cycle $20k peak, with a spike of 300K+ BTC.\n\nSTHs are normally adept at buying tops and selling bottoms, however, the distinct footprint of the above described events can be considered an exception to the trend. Both inflow events were in response to extreme drawdowns in price actions as well as severe STH outflows following bull market culminations.\n\nSuch events describe a transfer of coins to new buyers whom are initially classed as STHs, but have a low cost basis, but are in an advantageous financial position to HODL from there on.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nHaving established a case that this spike in STH cohort coins likely describe bear market floor buyers, we can also see this captured in the BTC denominated supply balance for Young Coins (< 3-months). We can see supply peaks in 2015 (x3), Nov 2018, March 2020, and during our most recent sell off.\n\nSimultaneously, these supply peaks tend to occur at the macro lows of young supply. This signals both a final flush out of sellers, followed by months of gradual accumulation, and the withdrawal of coins from the actively traded market.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe USD denominated wealth of the Young Coin cohort has been in structural decline following the March 2021 topping formation. This is a result of both the accumulation behavior (allowing coins to mature), but also the revaluation of coins to cheaper and cheaper prices during the bear.\n\nA growing divergence can be identified between the aforementioned cohorts USD wealth (Realized Cap HODL Waves) and their respective BTC denominated supply (HODL Waves).\n\nThe spike in BTC denominated value is not reflected in the USD denominated chart. This is because whilst 300k BTC in coin volume was transferred, their USD realized value has declined from say $50k-$60k, to $20k, which is notably lower.\n\nThis bolsters the case that we may very well have seen a meaningful capitulation take place in recent months. However, the onus is now on these new Short Term Holder bulls to hold the line.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nSummary and Conclusions:\n\nIn this newsletter, we assessed the relative distribution of supply and wealth for both Young and Old coins, to further understand the Bitcoin ownership structure. We established that the supply has undergone a significant transfer of wealth in recent months, with an observable and widespread capitulation, and thus equal and opposite accumulation.\n\nLong Term Holder Supply has seen a local, modest decline as spending behavior dominates following the LUNA collapse. However, LTH supply remains relatively range bound, which indicates more contained spending by a sub-set, rather than broad loss of confidence.\n\nIn contrast, Short Term Holders are seeing a divergence between BTC and USD denominated wealth. This is indicative of a pool of buyers who stepped in at the lows, and now hold some 300k BTC, acquired at a much lower cost basis. Now we turn to see if they have the conviction to hold on.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReleased support for APE, SHIB, SAND and stETH ERC20 tokens\nNew Metric Releases: Provably Lost, Probably Lost, Options Implied Volatility Smile and Options Implied Volatility Term Structure\nImproved labels for FTX Bitcoin Balance.\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nBetting on the Merge\n\nAs Bitcoin and Ethereum derivative markets mature, sophisticated trade positions can be established using both options and futures. The Ethereum Merge presents an opportunity to observe such market positioning at a large scale.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nAug 8, 2022 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market was relatively quiet this week, consolidating between a high of $23,832, and a low of $22,486. With market conditions still recovering from a fairly volatile June, there are subtle shifts occurring in positioning within Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives markets.\n\nIn this weeks newsletter, we will explore a notable divergence which has developed in the futures and options markets, centred around the Etheruem Merge scheduled for September. Traders appear to be utilising call options to bet on the ETH price into September, whilst futures and options backwardation indicate an expectation to sell-the-news is in play.\n\nThis appears to be relatively sophisticated market positioning, adding further evidence of institutional capital being deployed into the maturing liquidity of futures and options markets.\n\n, \nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Russian, Arabic and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nThe Bitcoin Baseline\n\nTo start our analysis, we will assess how derivatives markets are pricing Bitcoin, given there are few protocol level fundamental changes affecting the near term pricing.\n\nSince the start of April, Bitcoin futures markets have seen a dramatic increase in open interest, lifting off the baseline of around 350k BTC, and reaching new heights of 538k BTC. Growth is led by a handful of exchanges, primarily Binance, Deribit, OKEx, Bybit, FTX and CME.\n\nComparing open interest in a BTC denomination helps isolate periods of growth in futures leverage, from coin price changes. On a USD basis, current open interest is $12.4B, which is relatively low, and equivalent to the early bull market in Jan 2021, and at the $29k sell-off lows in June 2021.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Futures Open Interest breaking above 550k BTC would signal a new ATH in futures leverage, and suggest increased probability of a deleveraging event.\nLive Advanced Chart-\n\nFutures trade volume appears to have stabilised in the post-LUNA collapse era. Trade volume experienced a structural decline over the 12-months since the May 2021 sell-off, but appears to be re-establishing a floor at around $33B/day.\n\nGiven the large scale increase in open interest (on a relative scale), this may indicate that traders are increasingly willing to take on Bitcoin price exposure following the two major capitulation events in May and June.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Futures Volume (7D SMA) breaking above $45B would signal a notable uptick in trade volume, and suggest increased probability of near-term volatility.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nA structural change has also taken place in futures markets over the last 18-months. The proportion of coin-backed margin has declined from 70%, to a new normal baseline of around 40% dominance. In other words, approximately 60% of futures margin is now posted via stablecoin and fiat collateral, removing the added volatility brought on by collateral value changing alongside the futures contracts.\n\nThis means that whilst futures leverage is high, the underlying margin appears to be much more stable, reducing the impact of negative convexity in contrast to early 2021.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nFutures are pricing Bitcoin in a state of contango, where traders must pay a slight premium to obtain exposure to Bitcoin in the future. This is the more common condition for Bitcoin markets, and the premium out to years end is just 3.24%. This cash-and-carry yield is only barely competitive with yields available on US treasuries, and thus hardly indicative of any long-term bullish bias just yet.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nA similar level of neutrality can be seen in the perpetual swap funding rates, which are slightly positive, and yielding 2.3% on an annualized basis. As per the calendar futures, slightly positive yield is normal, and the level of funding rates suggest there is relatively little bias in either direction.\n\nOverall, Bitcoin futures markets appear to stabilising in trade volume, and are suggesting a slight bias towards upside. Open interest is high on a BTC relative basis, however not so much on a USD basis. This appears to indicate that traders are increasingly willing to take on BTC price exposure, but are not 'betting the farm' just yet.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Funding Rates (7D SMA) breaking below 0 would signal a negative reversal of current premium, and breaking above 0.005% would signcal increased speculative premium.\nLive Advanced Chart\nMerge Calling\n\nOn the other side of the fence however, derivatives traders are placing directionally obvious bets for Ethereum, specifically relating to the upcoming Merge planned on 19 September. For the first time in history, Ethereum options open interest at $6.6B is now higher than for Bitcoin at $4.8B.\n\nWhilst not an all-time-high yet, ETH options OI is close to setting a new one, whilst Bitcoin open interest remains well below the peak at just 35% of the ATH.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIf we look the the September contracts on Deribit, the directional bias of Ethereum traders is immediately clear. Call options dwarf put options for size, with traders betting on ETH prices upwards of $2.2k, with significant open interest even out to $5.0k.\n\nThe max pain price however is currently at around $1.35k, which would lead to the maximum number of options expiring out of the money. Given this is below the spot price as of today, it sets up for a very interesting month ahead.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThis large buy side demand for ETH call options expiring in September has pushed the volatility smile into a state of extreme bullish bias. Overlaid on this chart are open interest bars, where it can be seen that the upwards slope is driven heavily by traders willing to pay a premium for long call exposure.\n\nImplied volatility for this contract is well above 100% at almost all strike prices. The most bullish traders, who are buying call options above $5k, are willing to pay a premium of over 130% implied volatility.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nIf we compare the shape and scale of the September volatility smile to October, we can see a dramatic decline on the right tail, with a relatively flat shape, and sub-110% IV across the curve. This suggests a relatively lower demand for ETH exposure via options after the Merge event.\n\nInterestingly, post merge, the left tail is pricing in significantly higher implied volatility, indicating traders are paying a premium for 'sell-the-news' put option protection post-Merge.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nSelling the Future News\n\nGiven the strongly bullish bias in ETH options markets, it would be expected that spot demand would be quite strong. However, a look to the exchange net position change shows just -$700M on net withdrawn per month.\n\nWhilst $700M is a large sum, exchange withdrawals pale in comparison to the recent peaks of $3B+ per month, and also in comparison to the $6.6B in options open interest. Monthly exchange withdrawals today are just 2% the size of futures trade volume, whereas this ratio reached over 20% in April 2022 and November 2021.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe futures term structure for ETH is remarkably different to the Bitcoin curve in shape, and is in a condition of backwardation. This means that futures traders are pricing ETH at a discount post Merge, aligning with the higher premium paid by options traders.\n\nWhilst the discount is only small, just -2.27% annualized, it does suggest there is a large degree of short activity in the calendar futures markets. The most probable explanation is that investors are utilizing futures markets to both hedge downside risk, and perhaps finance the premiums paid on the options positions.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nLastly, we can see that demand for short calendar futures (3-month basis) is manifesting as a negative cost of carry, reaching around -3.68% annualized. This confirms that traders are willing to pay a premium for downside protection, with eyes on the Merge for both upside speculation into it, and a sell-the-news event after the fact.\n\nThis demonstrates how traders are placing increasingly sophisticated positions, utilizing the growing depth of futures and options markets. This however, is not reflected as strongly in spot markets, suggesting traders see the Merge primarily as an opportunity for price exposure, and less so as a case for a more fundamental spot position as yet.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nIn this newsletter, we analyzed both futures and options markets, to assess what the market is pricing for in the near term. With Bitcoin as a baseline, it suggests that investors are willing to take on more price exposure, but have not yet taken on heavy exposure. There is little directional bias evident in Bitcoin derivatives markets.\n\nOn the Ethereum side however, traders are clearly holding a long bias, expressed heavily in options contracts centred in September. Both futures and options market are in backwardation after September, suggesting traders are expecting the Merge to be a 'buy the rumor, sell the news' style event, and have positioned accordingly.\n\nSpot withdrawals for ETH from exchanges are however relatively small compared to recent demand peaks. This indicates that sophisticated traders are utilizing the depth of derivatives markets as the preferred instrument, to obtain price exposure, and hedging risk of the Merge event.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReleased support for APE, SHIB, SAND and stETH ERC20 tokens\nNew Metric Releases: Provably Lost, Probably Lost, Options Implied Volatility Smile and Options Implied Volatility Term Structure\nImproved labels for FTX Bitcoin Balance.\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nBeginnings of a Bear Market Rally?\n\nBoth BTC and ETH have rallied, coming off extremely oversold conditions, and spurred on by risk-on sentiment following the July FOMC meeting. Attention now turns to whether it is a bear market relief rally, or the start of a sustained bullish impulse.\n\nGlassnode\nAug 1, 2022 • 9 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin and digital asset markets responded strongly to the Federal Reserve 75 basis point rate hike this week, with BTC closing up 5.7%, and ETH up 7.6% on the week. Broader markets responded positively to the FOMC announcement as Chairman Powell indicated that the current target Fed Funds rate at 2.25% to 2.5% was now considered neutral, and eyes were on developing data on economic slow-down.\n\nIn many regards, recent positive price action for Bitcoin and Ethereum gives much awaited relief to the bulls, who have weathered almost nine months of persistent downtrend. The 2022 bear market has been historically negative for the digital asset space. However, after such a sustained period of risk-off sentiment, attention turns to whether it is a bear market relief rally, or the start of a sustained bullish impulse.\n\nIn this edition, we will explore this concept utilising on-chain activity as a baseline, and whether the market is signalling an influx of new demand, or if it lacks sustained follow through.\n\n🔔 Alert Ideas are presented throughout to help identify key metric levels of interest that may signify significant shifts in market/network performance. Any Glassnode member can set an alert directly from Glassnode Studio.\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Russian, Arabic and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nBitcoin Activity Grinds Sideways\n\nGenerally speaking, an influx of new demand into blockchain networks is supported and signalled by sustained upticks in usage on-chain. We can use both on-chain activity, and supply dynamics to assess performance relative to recent comparable history as a guide.\n\nBullish Impulses tend to be described by rising and elevated on-chain activity as more users enter the network. Generally this is supported by increasing volumes of supply changing hands at a profit as older investors sell, and new demand absorbs these coins.\nBearish Impulses tend to see declining on-chain activity, often in a violent and rapid flush out. Bear markets then take time to recover as supply rotates from speculators, back to long-term and high conviction holders.\n\nBitcoin active addresses remain firmly within a well defined downtrend channel 🔴. Note also how the Oct-Nov ATH 🔵 reached significantly lower peak than the April 2021 ATH, suggesting a major washout of users had occurred, and demand did not follow-through.\n\nWith exception of a few activity spikes higher during major capitulation events, the current network activity suggests that there remains little influx of new demand as yet.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Active Addresses (14 SMA) breaking above 950k would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe demand for on-chain transactions and blockspace tells a similar story. The market structure of the last year is quite similar to the 2018-19 period (shown in 🔵).\n\nAfter the initial wash-out in and demand destruction May 2021 🔴, transactional demand has traded sideways to slightly lower, indicative that only the stable base of higher conviction traders and investors remain.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Transaction Rate (14 SMA) breaking above 3.0 would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAs a result of lacklustre transaction demand, on-chain transaction fees are firmly within bear market territory 🔵, seeing only 13.4 BTC in total fees paid per day. Similar to active addresses, and transaction demand, the demand destruction 🔴 is visible in May 2021, as network congestion collapsed, and fees started forming a bear market baseline.\n\nBull markets typically maintain elevated fee rates 🟢, and often are one of the first signals of demand recovery. Whilst we have not seen a notable uptick in fees yet, keeping an eye on this metric is likely to be a signal of recovery.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Transaction Fees (14 SMA) breaking above 35 BTC/day would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can confirm these observations by looking at the average data footprint (in bytes) of Bitcoin blocks:\n\nNetwork congestion and full blocks 🔴 will result in larger block sizes as miners fill blocks as tightly as possible to earn maximum fee revenue.\nLow network congestion and partially empty blocks 🔵 will result in smaller blocks as there are insufficient transactions for miners to fill all capacity.\n\nNote that SegWit is a technological upgrade to Bitcoin that acts to increase the maximum data capacity of Bitcoin blocks. Prior to June 2021, SegWit adoption was below 55%, meaning the maximum block capacity was smaller than it is now. However, given SegWit adoption has now reached in excess of 72%, there is more effective blockspace capacity, yet current congestion is even lower than it was in May 2021.\n\nThis indicates that overall, the Bitcoin network remains HODLer dominated, and as yet, there has not been any noteworthy return of new demand, as viewed through the lens of on-chain activity.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nOn a more positive note however, the capacity in Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN) public channels continues to print new all-time-highs. Total LN public capacity has now reached 4,405 BTC, which is an increase of 19% over the last two months, despite the prevailing bear market.\n\nThis metric measures the liquidity available for users to send value routed through nodes that have public channels, and is a good gauge for expanding network effects. It does not account for private channels setup between two counter-parties whom have not opened up their node for public routing.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nNew Glassnode x CoinMarketCap Report\n\nWe are pleased to release a new report in collaboration with CoinMarketCap exploring just how challenging the 2022 bear market has been for Bitcoin, and Ethereum investors. We analyse the structural shifts happening in asset dominance, stablecoins, investor profitability, and whether signals of bear market bottom formation are in play.\n\nRead our latest report and see the content in a live dashboard.\n\nRead the Report\nA Short Burst of Ethereum Activity\n\nThe Ethereum network has experienced many of the same trends as Bitcoin over the last 12-months, seeing a gradual deterioration of aggregate network usage and congestion. Despite powerful price action over the last few weeks, Ethereum network congestion is in fact the lowest it has been in some time, manifesting as multi-year lows in gas prices paid for confirmation.\n\nEthereum transaction demand has been in a gradual decline since the May 2021 sell-off, seeing only a short burst of activity in recent weeks. If this trend can continue higher, it may be constructive, and is one to keep an eye on.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Transaction Count (14 SMA) breaking above 1.25M would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nEthereum tends to have a larger pool of transactions in the mempool compared to Bitcoin, and consistently sees blockspace filled to 99%+ capacity. As a result, the gas price paid is often a superior method for tracking true congestion.\n\nThis acts to capture the urgency of users seeking transaction confirmation, as measured by the value they are willing to spend on fees.\n\nThe chart below shows:\n\n🟢 Average Gas Limit which is the maximum gas that miners can fit in a block (currently 15M, but can expand to 30M under EIP1559).\n🔴 Average Gas consumption per block which is the actual usage profile relative to the Gas Limit.\n🔵 Median Gas Fee in Gwei which can be seen to expand in periods of demand, and contract during quiet periods of low congestion.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nEthereum gas prices have recently declined to just 17.5 Gwei on a 7-day median basis. This is the lowest network congestion and gas price since May 2020, which was prior to DeFi Summer, and before the initiation of the bull market.\n\nThis signals that despite recent positive price action, there has not been an influx of new usage, and overall, the Ethereum is at a multi-year low in relative activity.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Median Gas Price (7 SMA) breaking above 30 Gwei would signal an uptick in on-chain activity, suggesting potential market strength and demand recovery.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nAs a result, the ETH burn rate via EIP1559 is now at an all time low. Total ETH burned is now just 11% of the total issuance. Ethereum has only crossed into deflationary territory on three occasions in the past under the current issuance schedule.\n\nThis effectively means a relatively large volume of ETH is making it into circulation in comparison to all post-EIP1559 history.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nAbsorbing Profits\n\nTo close this piece, we will assess the market structure of Bitcoin and Ethereum through the lens of the SOPR metric. SOPR captures the average profit (> 1.0) or loss (< 1.0) realized by the market on spent coins. Generally speaking:\n\n🟢 High values (> 1.0) indicate larger magnitude profits are being realized, and the market has sufficient demand flowing in to absorb it.\n🔼 Bull Market Support is characterised by SOPR values of 1.0 acting as support, as investors buy at their cost basis during pull-backs.\n🔴 Low Values (< 1.0) indicate larger magnitude losses are being realized and investors are selling coins below their cost basis on average.\n🔽 Bear Market Resistance are characterised by SOPR values of 1.0 acting as resistance, as investors sell at their cost basis during rallies.\n\nFor Bitcoin, SOPR is attempting to break above 1.0 for the second time since early June. Usually, the market requires a number of attempts before escape velocity can be reached. An ideal bullish scenario would be a break above 1.0, and then a retest, finding support.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: BTC SOPR (7 SMA) breaking above 1.0 and holding that level would signal profitability is returning, and a possible market recovery.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nEthereum has had more luck, piercing above a SOPR value of 1.0, and finding its first retest as support. However, given the somewhat lacklustre on-chain activity metrics explored above, it is prudent to watch for a reversal back below 1.0, which could signal weakness. This would resemble previous bearish periods where a brief excursion above 1.0 can be observed, before rejecting back into net loss territory.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: SOPR (7 SMA) breaking below 1.0 and would signal a decline in profitability, and indicate potential market weakness.\nLive Advanced Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen a rebound in prices this week, coming off the back of extremely oversold conditions, and spurred on by risk-on sentiment following the July FOMC meeting.\n\nHowever, under the surface, on-chain transactional demand remains lacklustre at best, and this rally has not yet seen a convincing follow through in observable demand activity. The net result is that Bitcoin blocks are partially empty, Etheruem gas prices are at multi-year lows, and the rate of EIP1559 burning is at all-time-lows.\n\nOf course, on-chain activity is only part of the picture, and early signs of SOPR profitability returning are encouraging. Attention can now shift to whether these uptrends can be sustained and improve, as a gauge for whether this is simple bear market relief, or a more constructive structural shift.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReleased support for APE, SHIB, SAND and stETH ERC20 tokens\nNew Metric Releases: Provably Lost and Probably Lost\nWorkbench performance improvements: Significantly improved speed of min/max functions, sma function and hline function\nImproved labels for Gemini ETH balance.\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Momentum in the short term is favorable, however remains weighed down by longer-term macro indicators that time may be required to form a firm foundation.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nJul 25, 2022 • 11 min read\n\nAfter a month of consolidation, Bitcoin prices experienced a long awaited relief rally, closing 9% above the weekly open. Price action opened at $20,781, rallied into a peak of $24.179, before pulling back towards the highs of the consolidation range over the weekend.\n\nIn this edition, we will assess the sustainability of the current market rally through the following concepts:\n\nAssess price zones of interest from supply concentrations, technical, and on-chain pricing models.\nEvaluate the market reaction to many metrics reaching statistically significant over-correction.\nGauge the strength of the upwards move by assessing confluence through momentum oscillators (MRGO and moving averages).\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Russian, Arabic and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nHODLer Supply Concentrations\n\nWith the market valuation of Bitcoin falling over 75% in 2022, speculators have been largely expelled from the network (as discussed in WoC 27). During this process, a redistribution of coins from lower conviction to strong conviction holders takes place. This is a mechanism native to any market cycle where assets are transferred to more cost insensitive HODLers who invest with longer time frames, and allow their coins to mature in cold storage.\n\nWe can observe this phenomena via the Unspent Realized Price Distribution (URPD), separated by the Short Term and Long Term Holder cohorts. Note, that the Short-to-Long-Term Holder threshold (155-days) is back in mid-Feb when prices were trading around $40k.\n\nThe $20K region has attracted a large cluster of Short-Term Holder coin volume. This is a result of a significant transfer of ownership from capitulating sellers, to new and more optimistic buyers.\nShort Term Holder demand nodes can also be seen at the psychological price levels of $40K, $30K and $20K. Notably, much of this supply (incl. the LTH supply above) has not capitulated, despite prices trading more than 50% below their acquisition level. This is likely indicative of ownership by relatively price insensitive buyers.\n\nIt would be constructive to see these STH held coins at the $40k-$50K level start to mature to LTH status over coming weeks, helping to bolster this argument.\n\nLive Metric in the Glassnode Engine\n\nLooking at the URPD by cohort age, we can observe the distribution of the Bitcoin Supply by time since the coins were last transacted. There are two fundamental points to takeaway:\n\nElevated demand can similarly be noted around the $20K region with a vast amount of recent transaction occurring in this zone. This area also contains the 2nd and 4th largest URPD nodes (around 900K BTC) further indicating there was a large transfer of ownership within this zone.\nMaturity can be seen to decline from the ATH to current market value, reflective of the duration of the prevailing downtrend. Large volumes of coins accumulated over 6-months ago, which are holding heavy unrealized losses appear unwilling to sell.\n\nBoth URPD formats present a case that an increasingly large proportion of the supply is held by HODLers who are allowing coins to mature despite holding losses. Their demand inflows have centred around the psychological $20k, $30k and $40k consolidation zones.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that during this process, many long-term holders have contributed to the sell-side, and the URPD charts essentially represent the ‘post-dust settling’ condition to date. Furthermore, it is possible that these high supply concentration nodes, may act as firm resistance when the market attempts to recover higher.\n\nLive Metric in the Glassnode Engine Room\nRebounding Off An Over-extension\n\nPrices have responded positively this week, breaking above the recent consolidation zone. This comes off the back of what may be considered a significant short-term over-correction, with many metrics reaching extreme statistical deviations.\n\nThis was driven heavily by a period of rapid deleveraging across the market, with many lenders, investors, and trading firms seeing collateral liquidated, either by discretion, or as forced sellers as seen in WoC25: Falling Dominoes: Capitulation Across the Board and WoC23: Miner Incomes Under Stress.\n\nThe Mayer Multiple can be used to assess deviations between spot prices and the 200DMA. The 200DMA is widely used within traditional technical analysis as a tool to distinguish between between macro bull and bear trends.\n\nAt the most extreme during this price correction, the Mayer Multiple had reached below 0.55, signalling the market was trading at a 45% discount to the 200DMA. Such events are extremely uncommon, and only account for 127 closes out 4186 days, a total of 3% of the trading history.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe MVRV Metric is another powerful tool to assess these deviations between spot pricing, and the aggregate market cost basis. With BTC prices breaking above the Realized Price this week pushing the wider market back into aggregate profit, short term outlook has shifted upwards with participants eager for any form of relief rally.\n\nBitcoin as an asset is constantly maturing, in recent years it has garnered interest on both institutional and national levels. Therefore, to account for dynamic economical climates, a 4 Year Rolling Z-Score is used to normalize the data whilst also capturing the common halving cycle.\n\nStandard Deviations below -1 have a strong history of helping to identify bottom formation. Thus far, it has signaled undervaluation for all bear cycle bottoms, including 2015, 2018, and the March 2020 flash crash.\nThe June leg down in price action has produced the lowest 4-yr rolling Z-Score value on record, suggesting a statistically extreme deviation was reached, adding fuel to the present upwards relief rally.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can now introduce the concept of Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), which we use as a gauge for periods where relatively old, or young coins are dominating the spending behavior. For each day a coin remains unspent, it accumulates one coin-day, equal to its BTC volume. When that coin is spent, it is considered to destroy that accumulated time, producing the CDD model. This tool effectively captures the time-weighted economic value of coins that are on the move each day.\n\nHere we compare whether the Monthly average CDD value is higher, or lower than the Yearly average.\n\nBlue Zones in the chart below show periods where recent expenditure of older coins is exceeding the yearly average. This is typical of bull markets (profit taking) but also capitulation events in bear markets (panic selling, capital preservation).\n\nFrom this, we can deduce that longer-term investors with older coins have accelerated their spending of more mature UTXOs as prices traded down into the lows.\n\nLice Advanced Workbench\n\nThe MVRV Z-Score (blue) can then be used in combination with the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) oscillator (orange). This produces a model which observes both both aggregate profitability (MVRV) and the coin age demographics dominating actualized spending behavior (CDD).\n\nElevated CDD oscillator values above 1 whilst the market is in aggregate loss (MVRV below 1) generally coincides with capitulation periods.\nElevated CDD oscillator values above 1 whilst the market is in aggregate profit (MVRV above 1) usually coincides with topping structures.\n\nWhat this model signals is when longer-term investors are both spending a larger proportion of coins, at the same time as the market is on aggregate under-water on their position. What we can see is that longer-term investors have likely experienced an appreciable degree of capitulation between May and July.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can now formalize this observation by inspecting the actual spending behavior of Long-Term Holders. Long Term Holders (LTH) are often considered synonymous with the HODLer class and represent participants of statistically higher conviction. In the chart below, we compare the profitability of their more recent monthly spending, to their yearly average.\n\nWhen monthly profitability exceeds yearly profitability (orange), the market is entering overheated conditions, as LTHs are spending more, and taking increasingly large profits.\nWhen monthly profitability is less than yearly profitability (red), it generally suggests extended Bear Market momentum is in effect, and losses are being locked in by the LTH cohort.\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nIn the current market, Long Term Holders have seen their recent profitability drift significantly below their yearly performance, for almost 400 consecutive days. The decline has reached similar duration and depth to the 2018 bear market lows, and provides added weight to the arguments made above.\n\nWith such severe statistical deviations from the mean punctuated with unprecedented forced selling from crypto-native institutions across the board, a wave of relief was of high probability. In the next section we will assess the conditions required for continuation of the current upwards momentum as well as the conditions that would lead to rejection.\n\nResistance to Recovery\n\nWith price action now experiencing its first relief rally since April, we can assess various models which have provided overhead resistance in previous bear cycles. We can compare resistance levels between both a macro technical view point, and then seek confluence with a suite of on-chain models.\n\nThe following simple moving averages have displayed relevance for Bitcoin price action through time:\n\nThe 200WMA is currently at $22K and has historically been an indicator for bottoming formation.\nThe 111DMA is a component of the Pi Cycle Top indicator, and currently resides at $30K, aligning with a psychological price level, and with supply concentrations detailed above.\nThe 200DMA is trading at $35K, and remains a key transitional boundary between macro bull and bear market momentum.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nNext, the on-chain cost basis of Short Term Holders, Long Term Holders, and finally the aggregate market Cost Basis can be used to assess relative price action strength. We can also consider the Realized Price to Liveliness Ratio (RPLR), which aims to describe a sort of HODLer implied fair value.\n\nPrice has recorded a breakout above both the Realized Price, and the LTH Realized Price, which are each trading at $22K. The channel between the two is a contested point of interest providing confluence with the 200 WMA.\nThe Short Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis is currently trading at $28.5K and is in a strong downtrend. This is a product of two mechanisms, STHs realized losses, lowering their average cost basis, and the transfer of coin wealth to a new cohort of STHs buying closer (or below) the current spot price.\nThe RPLR is trading at $35.8k, which provides confluence with the 200DMA. Given the wide view on the 200DMA, and the implied value imparted by HODLers in the RPLR, these models make for a structural level worth keeping an eye on.\nLive Professional Workbench\n\nAn interesting interaction to observe is when the cost basis for LTH cohort trades back above the aggregate cost basis for the wider market (the Realized Price). For the LTH RP to increase, LTHs must either buy coins above their own cost basis, or coins with a higher cost basis must mature past the 155-day threshold. In a bear market, this is often a high bar, and rarely happens.\n\nInstead, the Realized Price generally climbs as a result of profits being realized. As the market bottoms, strengthens, and sufficient demand flows in to absorb profit taking, the Realized Price can climb, above the LTH Realized Price.\n\nThe duration of previous bear market low divergences has ranged between 248-days and 575-days. In the current cycle, it has only been in effect for 17 days, a comparatively short duration.\n\nLive Professional Workbench\nConfluence in Momentum\n\nThe Market Realized Gradient Oscillator is a statistically normalized oscillator, designed to measure the relative change in momentum between speculative value, and true organic capital inflows. It does this by comparing the rate of change between the Market Price, and the Realized Price.\n\nPositive Values indicate constructive upwards momentum over the considered period.\nNegative Values indicate bearish momentum over the considered period.\nBreaks above or below 1 indicate a changing momentum to the upside or downside, respectively.\n\nHere, we assess for confluence between the 14, 28 and 140 days variants of the oscillator to identify connection across multiple timeframes.\n\nStarting with the 14day MRGO, a positive breakout can be seen producing structural higher highs indicating increasing momentum. The 14 day oscillator is particularly sensitive due to its bi-weekly period and is thus a more responsive, but noisier variant.\n\nFurther continuation of this pattern to the upside would signify short term relief is a probability.\nRejection from positive regions would indicate a deterioration in short term momentum.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe 28day MRGO is similarly producing higher highs suggesting that downside momentum is slowing over the longer term. It is currently signalling modest upside momentum is in effect. However, as seen immediately prior to the June sell off, the previous attempt at upside momentum failed to achieve escape velocity and was followed by a violent collapse in price.\n\nThus, the market momentum relative to measurable capital inflows is at a cross-roads in the short-term.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe 140day MRGO is a much longer time frame momentum oscillator. Unlike the previously discussed variants, the 140day is less sensitive to short term price volatility and thus represents a proxy for long duration momentum, and macro trends.\n\nThe 140day MRGO has seen persistently lower peaks since March 2021 and has not recorded a positive value in 2022. This highlights a macro bearish market dynamic has likely been in effect for the last 15 months.\nThe current extended negative value regime is indicative of the persistently negative price performance in 2022, and remains in the favor of the bears at this stage.\nThe underlying trend continues to slowly grind higher indicating a potential longer term recovery is in effect, however suggests additional duration and recovery time may be required.\n\nThough the lens of the 140 day MRGO, the sell-off back in May 2021 remains the most severe momentum shift in this cycle. However, as discussed in A Bear of Historic Proportions, the recent sell-offs in May (LUNA) and June 2022 can be considered some of the largest on record. This indicates on a macro scale, the degree of downside market momentum is diminishing over time, potentially signalling a degree of seller exhaustion, and stabilization is on the horizon.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\nConclusions and Summary:\n\nWith so little price relief year to date, profitability has been poor for all investor classes. The Long Term Holder cohort is no exception, and their spending patterns suggest a non-trivial flush out has occurred between May-June 2022.\n\nHowever, long-term supply dynamics continue to improve, as redistribution takes place, gradually moving coins towards the HODLers. Notable supply concentrations are observable at $20K, $30K and $40K, which tend to align with both technical, and on-chain price models, making these regions significant zones of interest.\n\nMomentum in the short-term suggests continuation of the upswing, provided the Realized Price and Long Term Holder Realized Price can hold as a support level. On the long-term, momentum suggests the worst of the capitulation could be over, however a longer recovery time may be required as foundational repair continues.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nNew Metric Releases: Provably Lost and Probably Lost\nWorkbench performance improvements: Significantly improved speed of min/max functions, sma function and hline function\nReleased new Lightning Network metrics Lightning Network Base Fee (Median), Lightning Network Fee Rate (Median), Lightning Network Gini Coefficient (Capacity Distribution), Lightning Network Gini Coefficient (Channel Distribution), Lightning Network Node Connectivity\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nTrading Below The Realized Price\n\nBitcoin prices have now traded below the Realized Price for over a month, with many signals that a deep and complete capitulation has occurred. As a result, numerous signals indicate that genuine bottom formation could be underway.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJul 18, 2022 • 11 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market caught a breath of upwards relief this week, rallying from $18,999, to the upper end of the consolidation range at $21,596. This follows a volatile response across markets early in the week, as US headline CPI inflation hit a forty-year high of 9.1%. There is also a challenging backdrop of growing civil unrest, rising energy prices, and resource scarcity in many nations around the world.\n\nWithin this context, the Bitcoin and wider digital assets market have already experienced one of the heaviest, and fastest downwards repricing events in their history. This process has cleared a great deal of excess leverage from the system, and has driven Bitcoin prices below the Realized Price (the estimated cost basis of BTC holders).\n\nIn this edition, we will study the current Bitcoin market structure, through the lens of both unrealized (held coins), and realized (spent coins) losses by various investor cohorts. The target of this study is to gauge whether a similar degree of seller exhaustion is in play compared to previous bear market cycle lows. These tools can help structure a case, and probabilities for a bear market bottom forming around $20k.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Russian, Arabic and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nLife Under the Sea\n\nTo start this piece, we will first define what is meant by Realized Value and Unrealized Value, as these concepts will be foundational to the insights that follow.\n\nRealized Value (spent coins) is the difference between the value of a coin at the time of disposal, and at the time of acquisition on-chain. For example, an investor buys 0.5 BTC at $40k, and then and withdraws it from an exchange. The investor then redeposits it for sale at $20k. Here, they have 0.5 * ($20k - $40k) = -$10k in realized losses.\nUnrealized Value (unspent coins) is the difference between the current value of a coin, and the value at the time of acquisition on-chain. In the example above, if the investor still holds 0.5 BTC, and the price is trading at $21k, they would hold an unrealized loss of 0.5 * ($21k - $40k) = -$9.5k.\n\nThe Realized Price is one of, if not the most widely recognized Bitcoin on-chain models, and is often considered to be the on-chain acquisition price (cost basis) of the Bitcoin supply. It is currently trading at $22,092, vs current spot price of $21,060, which puts the average Bitcoin investor at an unrealized loss of -4.67%.\n\nThe chart below shows how previous bear cycles have all bottomed and established an accumulation range bellow the Realized Price. Time spent below the Realized Price ranges from 7-days in March 2020, to 301-days in 2015.\n\nIf we exclude March 2020 (a flash event), the average time spent below the Realized Price is 197-days, compared to the current market with just 35-days on the clock.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nWe can visualize the aggregate Unrealized Profit/Loss within the Bitcoin network by taking the ratio between market price, and the realized price, yielding the MVRV ratio.\n\nHigh MVRV Ratios (> 1.0 🟠) signify a larger degree of unrealized profit is held within the system. Historically values exceeding 3.0 have signalled overheated bull markets.\nDeclining MVRV Ratios (🔵) signify reducing profitability in the system. This is the result of both falling prices (lower MV), and also coin redistribution, as investors take profits and sell coins acquired at cheaper prices, to new buyers at higher prices (higher RV). A large bearish divergence can be seen between the Apr and Nov 2021 ATHs as a result of this mechanism (shown in blue).\nLow MVRV Ratios (< 1.0, 🔴) signify the market price is below the average investors on-chain acquisition price. This is typical of late-stage bear markets, and is often associated with bottom formation, and accumulation.\n\nThe MVRV Ratio is currently trading at 0.953 (-4.67% unrealized loss), which is not as deep as the average of 0.85 (-15% unrealized loss) seen in previous bear cycles. This may mean further downside and/or consolidation time is required to establish a bottom. However, it may also signal that a greater degree of investor support exists in this bear cycle.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: MVRV breaking above 1.0 would signal a Price is breaking above Realized Price, suggesting potential market strength.\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nIn addition to the Realized Price, we have a number of supporting on-chain pricing models which tend to attract spot prices during late stage bears.\n\nDelta Price ($14,215, 🟤) is a form of 'half fundamental, half technical' hybrid pricing model. It is calculated as the difference between the Realized Price, and the all-time Average Price. Delta price has previously caught the bottom wicks of bear markets.\nBalanced Price ($17,554, 🔴) takes the difference between Realized Price, and Transferred Price (coinday time weighted price). This can be thought of as a form of 'fair value' model, capturing the difference between what was paid (realized, cost-basis), and what was spent (transferred).\n\nBoth the 2015 and 2018 bear market lows were set with a short-term wick down to the Delta Price (green zone). However, both accumulation ranges spent most of the bottom formation process trading between the Balanced Price (range low) and the Realized Price (range high) as shown in blue.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Price breaking below $17,545 would signal a break below Balanced Price, and potential market weakness.\nLive Advanced Workbench\nCoins Change Hands: Unrealized Loss\n\nMarket bottom formation often has a signature of large positive swings in unrealized profit and loss. This is a result of capitulation and coin redistribution to new buyers, who are now less sensitive to price fluctuations.\n\nThus, we can start by isolating only those coins which hold an unrealized loss (2021-22 cycle buyers), to calculate their aggregate USD value. With the market trading between $17.6k and $21.8k, the aggregate Unrealized Loss has ranged between -$165B and -$198B.\n\nNote how the total unrealized loss in the post-Nov ATH era was much larger in comparison to the May to July 2021 period, even when prices were at $29k (shown in 🔵). This is a result of coin redistribution during and after the Aug-Nov rally, and is the same mechanism that created the bearish MVRV divergence.\n\nThis generally confirms that the Aug-Nov rally was more akin to a 'bear market relief' rally, than a resumption of the bull market.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe chart below shows this total unrealized loss, as a proportion of the current market cap, to normalize for size. Here, we can see that the total unrealized losses are equivalent to around 55% of the market cap, which is larger than in March 2020, and not dissimilar in magnitude to the 2018 bear market lows.\n\nThe gradual downtrend of this metric (shown in 🟢) during largely sideways, accumulation style price action, is indicative of improving holder profitability:\n\nCoins are sold during capitulation events, and bought by lower time preference buyers.\nLosses transition from unrealized to realized\nCoins are thus re-valued to a new and lower cost-basis, with a new owner.\n\nAs prices start to rise, these newly acquired coins switch from holding an unrealized loss, to an unrealized profit, usually starting the bullish cycle again.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nInspecting the total BTC supply in profit can bolster this argument. When prices fell to $17.6k, a total volume of 9.216M BTC were holding an unrealized loss. However, after the 18-June capitulation, one month of consolidation, and a price rally to $21.2k, this volume has declined to 7.680M BTC.\n\nWhat this suggests is that 1.539M BTC were last transacted (have a cost-basis) between $17.6k and $21.2k. This indicates that around 8% of the circulating supply has changed hands in this price range.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nWe can also inspect the coins holding an unrealized profit, this time through the lens of Long- and Short-Term Holders. We can see that all previous bear market lows reach a point where there are effectively no Short-Term Holders in profit, as the market dives well below their acquisition price.\n\nFor a strong market recovery, analysts can monitor whether the volume of STHs in profit swells rapidly should prices rally out of the consolidation range. An event like this has followed every major bear market floor (green), as investors who capitulated, transferred their coins to new buyers, with a lower, and thus less price sensitive cost basis.\n\nLive Professional Chart\nDeep Capitulation: Realized Losses\n\nIn order for a market floor to be established, Bitcoin investors typically need to experience a wide-ranging capitulation event. This acts to flush out all remaining marginal, and forced sellers, effectively creating seller exhaustion.\n\nMay and June 2022 have seen two such events, both during the LUNA collapse, and when prices plunged below the 2017 cycle ATH on 18-June. On a 30-day sub basis, these events triggered total realized losses of $27.77B, and $35.5B over a 30-day window, respectively. As shown, these eclipse anything seen historically on a USD basis.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe same can be said about BTC denominated losses, which are so large, that we have to look back to 2011, when BTC was trading below $3, to find an equivalent. A simply staggering volume of BTC locked in a realized loss between May and July, with 538k BTC spent during the LUNA collapse, and another 480k BTC spent on 18-June.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThe structure of the aSOPR metric also displays many similarities to bear market capitulation events. As profitability declines (blue), investors start to lock in increasingly large losses, until a final waterfall moment of capitulation (red) takes place. The market eventually reaches seller exhaustion, prices start to recover, and investor pain starts to subside (🟢).\n\nA recovery of aSOPR back towards (and ideally above 1.0) would help bolster the observations above, that complete capitulation has taken place, accumulation is underway, and the market is recovering well.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: aSOPR on 14-day SMA breaking above 1.0 signals a return to profitable spending, and a potential market recovery.\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe proportion of transfer volume in profit is also has market structure similar to previous bear market lows. During the 2015 and 2018 capitulation phases, over 58% of transfer volume was realizing a loss, and momentum had compressed after months of bearish price action.\n\nAs the market started to bottom, a greater proportion of coin volume had a lower cost basis, and spending was no longer heavily dominated by panic sales, and/or forced sellers.\n\nAt the moment, 54% of the transfer volume is in loss (46% in profit), which is very close to 2015/18 recovery levels. Similar to aSOPR, upwards recovery of this metric would provide signal that seller exhaustion may have been reached, and recovery could be underway.\n\n🔔 Alert Idea: Percent Transfer Volume in Profit on a 90-day EMA breaking above 48% would signal a recovery of profitability, and potential market strength.\nLive Professional Chart\nImpacts on Supply Dynamics\n\nTo close out this piece, we will inspect the Realized Cap HODL waves, which map out the distribution of the USD wealth stored in Bitcoin, by various age bands. We have split this into two cohorts; Coins aged 3-months or less (Hot Money), and Coins aged 3-months or more (HODLer Money).\n\nThe total USD value held in the 'Hot Money' is in a structural downtrend, and has now fallen below 20%. This describes two phenomena:\n\nOlder coins have largely slowed their spending, else these younger age bands would be swelling (as is the case in bull markets, as long-term investors take profits). This is a signal of high HODLer conviction.\nLong-term investors are gradually accumulating 'Hot Coins' and taking them off-market, allowing them to age and mature in cold storage (as seen in WOC 27 with historically large exchange withdrawals).\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nFinally, inspecting the older cohort of coins, we can see the mirror image, where over 80% of the USD wealth is now older than 3-months (acquired before LUNA collapsed). This trend continues to increase, driven strongly by the 6m-1y and 1y-2y brackets. This is despite a great majority of the capitulation and forced sellers being from these 6m-2y cohorts (as we explored in Week 26).\n\nAgain, this has numerous hallmarks of the Bitcoin market approaching seller exhaustion.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nConclusions and Summary\n\nThe Bitcoin market has corrected hard, and fast in 2022, driven by the unwind of excess leverage, and a plethora of forced sellers and liquidations. In a relatively short 7-month period, BTC has traded from an ATH, all the way into what resembles a bear market bottom.\n\nIn the piece above, we explored the current markets structure through the lens of Unrealized and Realized Losses, seeking signals of seller exhaustion.

Here, we analyse the characteristics and duration of previous bear cycles, to assess what may lie on the road ahead.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nJul 11, 2022 • 10 min read\n\nBitcoin prices continue to consolidate around the $20k range this week, as the market digests the extreme downside volatility of June. Prices traded higher, opening at a weekly low of $18,971, and peaking at $22,230.\n\nWith the market now down over 75% from the all-time-high, even the strongest and longest term Bitcoin holders are feeling the pressure. Both Long-Term Holders and Miners are in the spotlight this week, as the market attempts to find a bottom amidst persistent macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nIn this edition, we will seek to extract and identify key characteristics that have historically described the formation of Bitcoin bear market floors. This is a period of time where forced sales pass by, seller exhaustion is reached, and downside pressure begins to wane. We will explore this from a number of angles ranging from:\n\nA final flush out of even the strongest hands, creating seller exhaustion.\nThe redistribution of wealth from low to high conviction holders.\nA recovery of demand from both Big and Small entities.\nA capitulation of the miner cohort which appears to be underway.\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Russian and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nWealth Redistribution\n\nThe prevailing bear market has numerous similarities to late-2018 in terms of market structure, which we can see in the Drawdown from the ATH metric. The following compares the current 2022 bear, with the 2018 bear market:\n\nDecember 2017 - March 2019: The fallout from the 2017 parabolic top extended for almost 15 months, culminating in a 85% drawdown from the ATH. The $6K area can be seen as the base level breakpoint before the ultimate capitulation, where an additional -50% was wiped from the market over the course of 1-month.\nNovember 2021 - July 2022: The current Bear Market has experienced a peak drawdown of 75%, with the $29K floor acting as a similar breakpoint base level. The latest capitulation in mid-June saw prices tumble -40% to $17.6k in just two weeks.\nLive Chart\n\nOne of the main outcomes of a lengthy bear market is the redistribution of wealth among the stakeholders who remain. This progressive changing of hands can be analyzed by tracking the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD).\n\nAs highlighted in Week On-Chain 23, past bear markets, have had two distinct phases:\n\nPost-ATH Phase: Where the short-term investors and speculators (low conviction) gradually come to terms with the bear market reality and exit into a depreciating price trend. Moreover, some participants attempt counter-trading the macro trend leading to multiple temporary relief rallies (the dead cat bounce).\nBottom Discovery Phase: Diminishing profitability and an extended period of financial pain results in declining new demand and creates favourable conditions for ultimate capitulation.\n\nFirst, we will inspect the market from Dec 2017 to March 2019. Notice how price acts like a magnet, first attracting supply from top buyers towards the $6k region, and finally, an enormous redistribution occurs post capitulation into the $3k to $4k range. This describes a two part capitulation cycle, and eventual bottom formation\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn the current 2022 market, we have a similar structure so far following the November 2021 ATH. We can see a similar redistribution pattern occurs around the $30k floor, originally established in May-July 2021. Over the course of May-June this year, we can see prices trade down to the $20k region which becomes a significant trigger point for both investor capitulation, and new buyers, thus being a node for coins changing hands.\n\nLive Chart\nCapitulation of Diamond Hands\n\nWith the loss of the $30k price level, miners and long-term holders (LTHs) have come under stress (as explored in Week 25). To demonstrate the ongoing capitulation of 2021-22 cycle LTHs, we can monitor their profitability on two fronts; their actualized losses (spending) and unrealized losses (coins held below cost basis).\n\nLong-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (LTH-SOPR) is a metric which indicates the profit ratio captured by LTHs (i.e. a value of 2.0 means LTHs are spending coins at a price which is 2x their cost basis). Therefore, when LTH-SOPR is less than one, these players realize losses or spend coins at a price below their cost basis.\n\nLTH-SOPR is currently trading at 0.67, indicating the average LTH spending their coins is locking in a 33% loss.\n\nLive Chart\n\nLong-Term Holder Cost Basis estimates the average price long-term holders paid for their coins. Hence, as the market valuation falls below the LTH-Cost Basis, this cohort can be considered to be in aggregate loss. Similarly, LTHs are currently underwater on average, holding an aggregate unrealized loss of -14%.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe following chart combines these concepts and shows intervals which satisfy both conditions (in green). These moments are where LTHs are both underwater on held coins, and locking in losses based on their spending. In combination, this indicates there is an increased probability that a LTH capitulation is underway.\n\nWith the current value of LTH-SOPR at 0.67 and the LTH-Cost Basis at $22.3k, it means LTHs are realizing an average of -33% losses on each spent coin, despite spot prices only being ~6% below their cost basis. This signifies that LTHs who acquired coins at much higher are the primary spenders at the moment, and those who still hold coins from the 2017-20 cycle (or earlier) are largely sitting tight.\n\nLive Workbench\nThe Transfer of Losses\n\nA consequence of capitulation events is an immediate redistribution of coins to new buyers, whom are often classified as Short-Term Holders at first. Over time, however, the dominance of Long-Term Holders amongst the supply tends to increase, as fair-weather speculators are flushed from the market.\n\nBottom formation is often accompanied by LTHs shouldering an increasingly large proportion of the unrealized loss. In other words, for a bear market to reach an ultimate floor, the share of coins held at a loss should transfer primarily to those who are the least sensitive to price, and with the highest conviction.\n\nThis is the result of two mechanisms:\n\nThe exiting of entities with weak conviction (Short-Term Holders).\nThe gradual transfer of coins to entities with strong conviction, whom are relatively price-insensitive (Long-Term Holders)\n\nIn the depths of previous bear markets, the proportion of supply that was held by LTHs, and at a loss, reached above 34%. Meanwhile, the proportion held by STHs declined to just 3% to 4% of supply. At the moment, STHs still hold 16.2% of the supply in loss, suggesting that freshly redistributed coins must now go through the process of maturation in the hands of higher conviction holders.\n\nThis indicates that whilst many bottom formation signals are in place, the market still requires an element of duration and time pain to establish a resilient bottom. Bitcoin investors are not out of the woods yet.\n\nLive Chart\nThe Recovery of Demand, Both Big and Small\n\nA common component of previous bear market cycles is the expulsion of Bitcoin tourists. An observation made was the stand-out balance growth by Shrimps and Whales. Following on from this, we introduce a new indicator which seeks to track the relative on-chain activity of both small and large entities (originally coined by CryptoVizArt).\n\n🧵/1. Skewness, in statistics, is the degree of asymmetry observed in a probability distribution. Distributions can exhibit right (positive) skewness, left (negative) skewness, or no skewness (zero).\nIn the positive skewness case, the Mean > Median. pic.twitter.com/SFbiOP8nhK\n\n— CryptoVizArt.btc 📈 (@CryptoVizArt) February 22, 2022\n\nConsidering the historical transactional data for Bitcoin, the mean value of daily transfer volume has typically been larger than the median value. This is largely the result of there being a larger quantity of small value transactions and a smaller quantity of large value transactions.\n\nWe can see this in the consistent disparity between the Mean 🔴 and Median 🔵 transaction USD size throughout Bitcoin history. Therefore, the Bitcoin on-chain transaction value distribution displays positive skewness.\n\nSkewness is the degree of asymmetry observed in a distribution. Positive skewness occurs when the Mean is greater than the Median. This indicates that there are a greater number of small value transactions than large ones.\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can use this observation to develop a macro framework to assess the comparative level of activity, and demand from small, and large size entities. The oscillators below are constructed by taking the ratio between the 7DMA and the 365DMA of the median (small entities 🔵), and mean (large entities 🔴) USD-transaction volumes.\n\nWhen Small Entities 🔵 exceed Large Entities 🔴, it typically suggests an influx of small size transactions and is often associated with the excitement of bull markets and greater speculation.\nWhen the indicators are increasing, it can be considered to be a signal of higher demand from that entity cohort.\nWhen the indicators are decreasing, it can be considered to be a signal of lower demand from that entity cohort.\n\nWhat can be seen in the current market cycle is that the red curve has consistently traded above the blue curve. This indicates that the activity of large entities (likely institutions) has been dramatically higher than retail, both through the bull cycle and more recently during the capitulation events.\n\nFurthermore, we can see that smaller entities remain quite active relative to past bears, but we have not yet seen a bottoming and recovery reversal yet. This is a characteristic to keep an eye on to watch for expanding demand from both entity cohorts. The key takeaway from this metric is that whilst activity is in bottom formation territory, like the conclusion above, it has not yet reverted into recovery mode just yet.\n\nLive Workbench\nMiner Capitulation\n\nFinally, we will turn attention to the miner cohort, who often tend to become an influential source of selling pressure during late-stage bear markets. This is a result of the cyclical nature of their income, and current bear market has been no exception to this trend.\n\nTo track whether a Miner Capitulation is in play, we can consult a two-part model, which seeks confluence between implied income stress (Puell Multiple) and observed hashrate decline (Difficulty Ribbon Compression).\n\nThe Puell Multiple 🟠 tracks aggregate miner income in USD, relative to the 1-year average. Here, we can see that presently Bitcoin miners are earning just 49% as much as the 12-month average. This implies miner income stress is a likely factor.\nThe Difficulty Ribbon Compression 🟣 signals that hashrate is indeed coming offline, causing protocol difficulty to fall in a statistically significant way. This is an explicit observation that ASIC rigs are being switched off due to income stress.\nMiner Capitulation Risk 🟡 highlights periods where both metrics signalled meaningful lows and generally correlated with extreme bear market lows and an elevated risk of miner capitulation events.\nLive Workbench\n\nWith confirmation that miner capitulation risk is a factor, we can confirm that aggregate miner balances have experienced up to 4.47k BTC/month in distribution. This started primarily after the collapse of the LUNA-UST project.\n\nThe income stress on these miners has resulted in a total distribution of 7.9k BTC from their treasuries over a two month period. That said, miners have slowed their spending of late and are currently distributing from their stored treasuries at a rate of 1.35k BTC/month.\n\nThe duration of miner capitulation in the 2018-2019 bear market was around 4-months, with the current cycle only having started in 1-month ago. Miners currently hold approximately 66.9k BTC in aggregate in their treasuries, and thus the next quarter is likely to remain at risk of further distribution unless coin prices recover meaningfully.\n\nLive Workbench\nConclusion\n\nThe present market structure has many hallmarks of the later stage of a bear market, where the highest conviction cohorts, the long-term holders and the miners, are under remarkable pressure to surrender.\n\nThe volume of supply at a loss has now reached 44.7%, of which a majority is carried by the Long-Term Holder cohort. However, this remains at a less severe level compared to previous bear cycles. We also introduced a new indicator that tracks the activity level of small and large entities, as a tool to map market recovery. This supports the observation that the market is well into the bear, however has not yet formed a confident bottom, and still has work to do.\n\nOverall, the fingerprint of a widespread capitulation, and extreme financial stress is certainly in place. However, there may still be a combination of both time pain (duration), and perhaps further downside risk to fully test investor resolve, and enable the market to establish a resilient bottom.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReleased new metric for ETH: ETH 2.0 Deposited by Staking Providers, Ethereum: US Month-over-Month Price Change, Ethereum: EU Month-over-Month Price Change, and Ethereum: Asia Month-over-Month Price Change.\nImprovements to Dashboards: Video module, textbox scroll feature, reformatted sizing.\nWorkbench Updates: clicking on functions will paste them in the formula input field, users can now add multiple metrics at once, alpha and color input added to the colorpicker.\nReleased new Lightning Network metrics Lightning Network Base Fee (Median), Lightning Network Fee Rate (Median), Lightning Network Gini Coefficient (Capacity Distribution), Lightning Network Gini Coefficient (Channel Distribution), Lightning Network Node Connectivity\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Expulsion of Bitcoin Tourists\n\nBitcoin has locked in one of the worst monthly price performances in history, with prices trading down -37.9% in June. Bitcoin has seen a near complete expulsion of market tourists, leaving the resolve of HODLers as the last line standing.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nJul 4, 2022 • 10 min read\n\nAs the first half of 2022 comes to a close, Bitcoin has locked in one of the worst monthly price performances in history. Prices traded down -37.9% over the last 30-days, competing only with the 2011 bear market, for the crown of worst month on record. For a sense of scale, BTC prices were sub $10 in 2011.\n\nBitcoin prices consolidated this week, digesting the losses of the month, and maintaining a steady trading range around the 2017 $20k all-time-high. The market opened at a high at $21,471, traded down to brief mid-week low of $18,741, before rallying to close at $19,139.\n\nWith US inflation estimates for June remaining elevated, and storm clouds of a potential recession looming, the market remains heavily risk off. This is evident in the on-chain performance and activity of Bitcoin, which has reduced modestly in recent weeks. With network activity now at levels coincident with the deepest bear phase in 2018 and 2019, it appears that a near complete purge of market tourism has taken place.\n\nThe activity that does remain however appears to align with a steadfast trend of high conviction accumulation and self-custody. Exchange balances are draining at historically high levels, and Shrimp and Whale balances are increasing meaningfully.\n\nWith such complex and arguably divergence market forces, in this edition, we will attempt to identify the key trends that are emerging in on-chain performance and supply distribution for Bitcoin.\n\nLive Chart\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Hebrew and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nThe End of Bitcoin Tourism\n\nOne of the most fundamental concepts in Bitcoin analysis is the assessment of on-chain activity. The idea is to identify relative strength, or weakness in the user-base, especially to identify changes in macro network character.\n\nHigh Activity is often synonymous with an influx of new demand, increased speculation, and is usually associated with bull markets (shown in green below).\nLow Activity is often synonymous with greatly reduced demand, and waning interest from market tourists, and is typical of bear markets (shown in red below).\n\nAs we will shortly explore, almost the entire suite of on-chain activity metrics indicate that the number and activity of network users are approaching the deepest historical bear market territory. The Bitcoin network is approaching a state where almost all speculative entities, and market tourists have been completely purged from the asset.\n\nAddress activity for example has declined by 13% from over 1M/day in November, to just 870k/day today. This suggests little growth in new users, and even a struggle to retain existing ones.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA more advanced version of this metric is the Number of Active Entities, which benefits from our clustering algorithms. These methods collate multiple addresses and assign them to on-chain entities, providing a more accurate and clear reflection of the more probable active user-base.\n\nActive Entities did experience a notable rise post-Nov 2021 ATH as participants speculated on a further price leg up. However, this expectation has since dissipated, and has now established the prevailing downtrend. There are around 244k Active Entities per day, which is languishing around the lower end of the Low Activity channel typical of bear markets (shown in red).\n\nA retention of HODLers is more evident in this metric, as Active Entities is generally trending sideways, indicative of a stable base-load of users.\n\nLive Chart\n\nParticipant capitulation can be clearly observed through the collapse of Entities Net Growth, which shows the difference between new, and leaving entities on-chain. With exception of two major spikes during the LUNA collapse, and the sell-off in late June, overall growth rates are lacklustre to say the least.\n\nMost recently, the user-base growth rate has plunged to around 7k net new entities per day, which is similar to lows seen during the worst bear market levels in 2018, and 2019.\n\nLive Chart\nThe HODLer Baseload\n\nThe number of settled transactions sheds further insight into the demand for blockspace and network utilization on any given day. Assessing transaction counts is slightly more nuanced than Active Addresses/Entities for two reasons.\n\nLimits on available blockspace create a limit on transactional capacity with fees being the release valve (which are very low, indicating almost no observable congestion).\nThe increasing efficiency of transactional technology such as batching, and SegWit, both of which saw large-scale upticks in adoption through 2020.\n\nExtremely sharp decreases in transactions counts can be seen to punctuate the end of the bull markets in Jan 2018 and again in May 2021. After a few months of recovery, transactional demand can be seen to move sideways throughout the main body of the bear. This indicates both a stagnation of new entering demand, but also a probable retention of a base-load of users (the HODLers).\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo reinforce this point, the number of addresses with a non-zero balance continues to grind higher, hitting a new ATH of 42.2M, and only minimally influenced by the recent capitulation drawdown.\n\nThe Bitcoin network often sees a significant purge of wallets during major sell-off events and in early bear markets, as investors capitulate and spend everything.\n\nJan to Mar 2018 saw a flush of -7M addresses which initiated the bear market, and was equivalent to 24.4% of the total. This remains the largest reduction on record.\nApr to May 2021 saw a collapse of -1M Non-Zero addresses amidst the Great Miner Migration, a reduction of 2.8% and quite a mild reaction compared to 2018.\nMay 2022 saw a removal of -430k addresses, a reduction of 1%, and significantly less severe than Apr-May 21 despite a larger price collapse.\n\nPost-2018, the severity of Non-Zero address capitulation can be seen to diminish, indicating there is an increasing level of resolve amongst the average Bitcoin participant.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOn-chain activity remains severely muted, and convincingly in the bear market territory. Almost all of the marginal buyers and sellers appear to have finally capitulated and purged from the network over the last 12-months. This leaves only a baseload of HODLers with the highest resolve remaining. There are few reinforcements coming into the Bitcoin demand side, and thus prices are correcting until these HODLers can set the floor.\n\nExchanging Divergences\n\nExchanges remain a centrepiece of Bitcoin market infrastructure, with hundreds of millions, to billions of dollars in Bitcoin value flowing through on-chain each day. The number of exchange deposits and withdrawals, tend to show a high degree of sensitivity and correlation with spot prices.\n\nGenerally speaking, both deposits and withdrawal counts trend alongside price, peaking around bull market tops, when the inflow of speculative demand is highest. Withdrawals (green) are often fewer in number relative to deposits (pink). This is due to exchanges processing multiple customer withdrawals in a single transaction, where as deposits are processed on an individual basis.\n\nOver recent weeks, renewed attention has been placed on self-custody of blockchain assets, with a number of lending services halting user deposits and withdrawals. Perhaps in response to this unfortunate occurrence, we are currently seeing exchange withdrawals increasing, whilst deposit counts continue to decline.\n\nThis is historically unusual, with few similar examples in the last 5-years.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also assess the dominance of exchange related activity as a ratio of all transactions across the network. From this we can identify peaks and troughs in investor activity, and identify changes in base-load market structure.\n\nExchange transaction dominance reached an apex almost immediately after both bull market peaks in 2017 and again in 2021, capturing 80% to 94% of all activity. This marks the last gasp and influx of market tourism, as new participants buy the top, right before price plunges, and they are subsequently flushed from the network.\n\nExchange transaction dominance has undergone a lengthy detox since the May 2021 high, and appears to be stabilising at around 50%. This supports our earlier observations that the market is approaching a HODLer led regime.\n\nLive Chart\n\nExchange reserves continue to see large scale net withdrawals, with aggregate balances declining to levels last seen since July 2018. Overall balance on Exchanges have seen an aggregate outflow of -750k BTC since March 2020. The last three months alone have seen some 142.5k BTC in outflows alone, a remarkable 18.8% of the total.\n\nExchange outflows at this scale, especially in the face of such extreme downside price action are intriguing, and we will further break-down these flows in the next sections.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can observe changes in these reserves by individual exchange, where we see an interesting divergence is underway:\n\nCoinbase continues to see net outflows of coins, with an aggregate reduction of -450k BTC over the last two years. Coinbase balance has declined in a persistent 10k to 30k BTC step function. These coins are being transferred to new wallets which are not associated with the Coinbase entity. These may be custody solutions for institutions, given their holding size.\nBinance on the other hand has seen a net balance increase of roughly +300k BTC over the same time. As a result, Binance has now flipped Coinbase as the exchange with the largest Bitcoin supply as was highlighted by TXMC this week.\n\nFriends, the real flippening is upon us. A new king is set to be crowned, and the name is Binance.\n\nA withdrawal tithing of just 6214 #BTC will earn him the crown. pic.twitter.com/bGCy47yYeA\n\n— TXMC (@TXMCtrades) May 26, 2022\n\nAlongside a historically bad month of price performance, exchanges have seen the largest monthly decline on record, hitting an outflow rate of -150k BTC/month. This accounts for a typical balance reduction of 5.0% to 6.0% of the total through June. This is in stark contrast with the flood of coins into exchanges that occurred in May-June 2021.\n\nLive Chart\nWhere Did All The Coins Go?\n\nThe largest Exchange Net Position Change on record is complemented by the largest Illiquid Supply Change since June 2017.  Illiquid supply has increased by 223k BTC in July, reflecting a large scale movement of coins towards wallets with little to no history of spending (generally speaking. these are not exchanges).\n\nAgain, this is in direct contrast to both May 2021, and during the LUNA collapse, which both saw a collapse in price reciprocated by a collapse in Illiquid Supply.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs Exchanges on aggregate continue to deplete, we can see aggressive accumulation taking place by both the largest (10k+ BTC) and smallest (<1 BTC) Bitcoin participants. Both Shrimps and Whales have seen near perfect scores (blue) on the Trend Accumulation Score metric since mid-May, indicating their on-chain balance has increased meaningfully, and consistently.\n\nCohorts holding 10 to 10k BTC are almost perfectly neutral, with no notable change to their aggregate holdings.\n\nLive Metric in the Glassnode Engine Room\n\nDiving deeper into this, we can see that Shrimps are adding to their balance at a rate of 60.46k BTC per month, the most aggressive rate in history. This is equivalent to 0.32% of the circulating supply per month. Interestingly, the rate of Shrimp balance expansion surpasses the previous record set at the Dec 2017 ATH, when prices were also at $20k.\n\nThe Shrimp cohort clearly see $20k as an attractive price, albeit this time with the market trending in the other direction.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFinally, the chart below is derived from our Whale to/from Exchange Volume metrics, where a Whale is defined as an entity with > 1k BTC (excluding miners and exchanges).\n\nOn net, whales have withdrawn 8.69M BTC from exchanges we track, and their accumulation and distribution cycles appear to be well correlated with market price performance. Since April 2022, whale exchange volume have been predominantly withdrawals, reaching a significant rate of 140k BTC/month in June. This is the second highest rate in the last 5-years, surpassed only by the correction in Jan 2021.\n\nLive Chart\nConclusions\n\nBitcoin on-chain activity is firmly in bear market territory, and the most recent network utilization suggests an almost complete purge of all market tourists has occurred. Demand for blockspace is low, and the growth of network users is lacklustre at best.\n\nHowever, below the surface, the market is experiencing a number of very intriguing divergences. Despite a historically bad year-to-date, and now the worst month of price performance since 2011, strong HODLer undertones persist.\n\nExchange reserves continue to drain, as participants find renewed momentum towards self custody. These coins appear to be flowing into wallets with no history of spending, and the balance growth and exchange withdrawal activity of both Shrimp and Whale cohorts are at historically aggressive levels.\n\nThe Bitcoin bear is in full swing, and in its wake, the HODLers of last resort are the last ones standing.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nNew Glassnode Homepage is live at Glassnode.com\nImprovements to Dashboards: Video module, textbox scroll feature, reformatted sizing.\nWorkbench Updates: clicking on functions will paste them in the formula input field, and users can now add multiple metrics at once.\nReleased new Lightning Network metrics Lightning Network Base Fee (Median), Lightning Network Fee Rate (Median), Lightning Network Gini Coefficient (Capacity Distribution), Lightning Network Gini Coefficient (Channel Distribution), Lightning Network Node Connectivity\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nIs This Time Different?\n\nAlmost all macro indicators for Bitcoin are at all-time lows, signalling potential floor formation. Many are even trading at levels with single digit percentage points of prior history at similar levels. With numerous floor formation signals flashing, the question is, will this time be different?\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJun 27, 2022 • 11 min read\n\nAfter a volatile and challenging month in June, Bitcoin prices have started to consolidate around the last cycle $20k ATH level, giving investors a moment to pause and reflect. Prices did trade higher this week, coming off a low of $18,067, and rallying to a high of $21,783.\n\nThe digital assets market has recently experienced a widespread deleveraging event, which has driven many valuations to lows considered extreme, in both a historical and statistical context. We recently released two research pieces that provide detailed analysis into this de-leveraging event, covering both the Bitcoin and Ethereum markets. These will provide additional context supporting this weeks newsletter:\n\nThe Great DeFi Deleveraging covering the expulsion of over 60% of leverage accumulated in the Ethereum DeFi sector.\nA Bear of Historic Proportions where we explore the statistical deviation of Bitcoin and Ethereum from numerous long term means.\n\nIn this piece, we will provide an assessment of whether a Bitcoin bear market floor is likely to form within the current price range. We will draw on both on-chain, technical, and cyclical metrics. We will also gauge whether there is an observable loss of investor conviction, especially related to Long-Term Holders.\n\nNote: This newsletter edition puts an extra focus on the application of Glassnode Advanced metrics, and has a more fully featured dashboard experience to help our members navigate these challenging market conditions.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Hebrew and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nCharting The Depths\n\nOver the past decade, several models have been developed, from both technical and on-chain foundations, in an attempt to find the lows of Bitcoin bear markets. Here we will use the 2015, 2018 and March 2020 lows for comparison, and try to identify confluence between models.\n\nThere are five models shown on the chart below, listed in order of highest to lowest:\n\n🔴 Mayer Multiple of 0.6 ($23,380) price trading at a 40% discount to the 200-day moving average, with just 3.4% of trading days closing at or below this level.\n🟠 Realized Price ($22,500) being the aggregate cost basis of the coin supply, typically provides resistance during bottom formation. 14% of all trading days have closed below.\n🔵 200 Week Moving Average ($22,390) which has historically provided support during final bear market capitulation phase, and only 1% of days have closed below it.\n🟢 Balance Price ($17,980) which accounts for the destruction of coin-days, and reflects a market price that matches the value paid for coins, minus the value ultimately realized. Just 3% of trading days have closed below this model.\n🟣 Delta Price ($15,750) which is the difference between the Realized Price, and the all-time-average price. This level never been breached on a closing basis, and has provided ultimate final support in bears.\n\nIn the current market, spot prices ($21,300) are trading below the Realized Price, the 0.6 Mayer Multiple band, and the 200 Week MA, and recently broke below Balanced Price during the 18-June flush out to $17,600.\n\nOnly 13 out of 4,360 trading days (0.2%) have ever seen similar circumstances, occurring in just two prior events, Jan 2015 and March 2020. These points are marked in green on the chart below.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nThe Accumulation Trend Score metric continues to return high values in excess of 0.9 throughout the month of June. This is being primarily driven Whale (>10k BTC) and Shrimp (< 1BTC) entities adding meaningfully to their on-chain balance.\n\nIn the last five years, there are six periods with similar stretches, which fall into three categories:\n\nBull Market Rallies such as mid-2019 and the Q1-2021 Bull where influx of new demand pushes prices higher, often with early investors as the sell-side.\nThe Post Nov 2021 ATH which can be best described as dip buyers who were unfortunately much too early.\nBear Market Bottoms such as Nov 2018 and March 2020. These are periods where buy side demand finally overwhelms supply, and established a meaningful macro low.\nLive Advanced Chart\nCyclical Lows\n\nThe Reserve Risk metric has also plunged to all-time-lows. This metric is heavily weighed down when there is an excess of HODLing behaviour, and coinday accumulation within the supply. This indicates that despite serious the downside price action of 2022, Bitcoin investors in aggregate remain generally steadfast in holding onto their coins (for better or worse).\n\nSuch deep lows on this metric are coincident only with the late 2015 bear, and the March 2020 flash crash events.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nSimilarly, Dormancy Flow has hit what is effectively an all-time-low (we are discounting pre-2011 early data). Where Reserve Risk captures the accumulation of coindays (HODLing behaviour), Dormancy Flow weighs the Market Cap against coinday destruction (HODLers spending).\n\nWhat this metric is signalling that the Bitcoin Market cap is now very low relative to the value of coinday destruction. In other words, the asset is trading below implied fair value given the value that HODLers are liquidating. This is generally the case when the oldest coins that are being spent, are from the current cycle (i.e. old, but not ancient). We will revisit this idea later in this article.\n\nA bearish interpretation here could be that we are seeing a period of historically low demand, that is simply incapable of absorbing the distributed supply by investors. The more constructive interpretation is that the market has over-extended to the downside, and is mis-priced relative to the conviction in the holder base.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThe investor experience of HODLing Bitcoin for over 1yr is one of high volatility, and thus requires a sound thesis and strong conviction to avoid being shaken out.\n\nWith this in mind, the last cyclical oscillator in this sequence is the RHODL Ratio, which captures the relative wealth balance between 1y-2y old coins, and 1-week old coins.\n\nWith the RHODL Ratio approaching the macro range lows, this indicates that the coin supply is firmly and heavily dominated by these longer-term, more experienced investors. Conversely, there is a distinct lack of younger more inexperienced investors, which is synonymous with late stage bear markets, where the investor base is no longer saturated by new and inexperienced demand.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nThus we can see strong confluence between Reserve Risk, Dormancy Flow, and the RHODL ratio, which all suggest that the market remains dominated by strong thesis, high conviction investors.\n\nThe case for Bitcoin bottom formation is one grounded in observable dominance of strong hand investors, historically significant lows in numerous macro oscillators, and a strong confluence with prices hovering in striking distance of several bear market pricing models.\n\nHowever, can these HODLers hold the line?\n\nNew Glassnode Research: A Bear of Historic Proportions\n\nAs the Bitcoin and Etheruem prices plunge below the 2017-18 cycle highs, we quantify the magnitude of statistical deviation away from numerous 'fair value' means. What we find is that the 2021-22 bear market is arguably the most significant in digital asset history.\n\nRead our latest research piece here.\n\nA Bear of Historic Proportions\nHammering Out The Lows\n\nThere are a handful of metrics which are signalling that the market is in the process of hammering out a painful floor, likely best described as a capitulation and entry into a re-accumulation period.\n\nThe general trend of Active Addresses provides us with a reasonably good roadmap for progress through many phases of Bitcoin market structure. Bullish impulses are quite clear (green) whilst bear markets tend to oscillate sideways, or grind higher as the market recovers.\n\nActive addresses have been largely constant at around ~800k per day and are range-bound within in the Bear Market Channel (red). As we have noted in prior editions, this supports the thesis that it is only the HODLers that remain. As such, 2022 has been a process of prices correcting towards the price floor their demand is sufficient to set.\n\nLive Chart\n\nPrevious bear market floors have all bottomed out at a Percent Supply in Profit of around 40 to 45%. In other words, more than half of the coin supply was underwater. During the sell-off to $17.6k, the market did reach just below 50% supply in profit, triggering a significant capitulation and coin redistribution event (covered last week).\n\nThe net result of this redistribution is that a large volume of BTC has now changed hands below $20k. If we consider ~40-45% of supply in profit as an potential bear market floor threshold, how far must price now fall to plunge an additional ~5-10% of supply into loss?\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nIn the URPD chart below, we can see that around 1.43M BTC changed hands between the recent $17.6k low, and the current price of $21.6k. This means that after the recent supply redistribution, and capitulation event, a retest of those lows would put an equivalent amount of supply into a loss as during previous bear market floors.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nThe market structure of aSOPR also resembles a deep capitulation event, where the average spent coin was realizing a loss of -7%. The preceding early phase bear can be argued to include both mid-2021, and all of 2022 as shown in blue, which is similar to both 2018 and 2019 in structure.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nNew Glassnode Research: The Great DeFi Deleveraging\n\nThe Ethereum DeFi market is undergoing a dramatic deleveraging, with over $124B in capital flushed out in just six weeks. The Ethereum investor base is now heavily underwater on spot positions, and is locking in historically large realized losses.\n\nRead our latest research piece here.\n\nThe Great DeFi Deleveraging\nHave We Shaken HODLer Confidence?\n\nThrough the month of June, Long-Term Holder (LTH) supply declined by around 181.8k BTC, taking the total balance back to Sept 2021 levels. However, this equates to just 7.16% of the supply that was added between March and October 2021. Should this metric fall further, it would signal further sell-side pressure and a potential deterioration of LTH conviction. However a stalling and even recovery would work strongly against that notion.\n\nLive Professional Chart\n\nIn this final section, we will attempt to assess whether the conviction of these Bitcoin HODLers has been shaken, given they are the final line of defence. We will do so by estimating the age of coins being spent against the following thesis:\n\nIf the LTHs who are spending are predominantly from the 2021-22 cycle, it is more likely to be a classic capitulation, as investors holding underwater coins, through great volatility, finally throw in the towel.\nIf the LTHs who are spending are from the pre-2020 cycle, it is more likely to reflect a widespread loss of conviction across some of Bitcoin's strongest, and longest believers.\n\nWe will further unpack which sub-set of LTHs are driving this 181.8k BTC in spending pressure by looking at increasingly senior age bands, to apportion an approximate weight to each cohort.\n\nThe chart below shows Supply older than 6-months. This supply has declined by 168.5k BTC in June. Given the LTH threshold is ~5-months, this means that an estimated 13.3k BTC spent were 5-6months old, representing around 7.3% of the total.\n\nLive Advanced Workbench\n\nFor coins older than 1yr, this has declined from 65.72%, to 64.93% of circulating supply, equivalent to 150.7k BTC. Thus around 9.8% of LTH spending is attributed to 6m-12m old coins.\n\nContinuing the logic, we can see that spending by coins older than 1yr accounts for around 82.9% of the BTC spent by LTHs, which is the lions share of spending during the June capitulation event.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\n\nHowever, if we consider the Supply last active 2yrs+ ago, we can see it has more or less stabilised around 44.5% of circulating supply since April 2022.\n\nAs such, we can deduce that of the 181.8k BTC spent by Long-Term Holders, approximately:\n\n82.9% attributed to coins between 1yr and 2yrs old.\n9.8% attributed to coins between 6m and 12m old.\n7.3% attributed to coins between 5m and 6m old.\n\nThus our conclusion is that the recent LTH capitulation is almost entirely driven by 2020-22 cycle investors, and is most probably representative of a classic capitulation event, rather than a loss of conviction of very long-term Bitcoin investors.\n\nLive Advanced Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWithin the current macroeconomic framework, all models and historical precedents are likely to be put to the test. Based on the current positioning of Bitcoin prices relative to historical floor models, the market is already at an extremely improbable level, with only 0.2% of trading days being in similar circumstances.\n\nLong-Term Holders have experienced a long-overdue, but seemingly classic capitulation in June, driven mostly by 2020-21 cycle investors. Almost all macro indicators for Bitcoin, ranging from technical, to on-chain are at all-time lows, coincident with bear market floor formation in previous cycles. Many are trading at levels with just single digit percentage points of prior history at similar levels. This aligns with the very large statistical deviations to the downside that we explored in our recent analysis piece.\n\nWith so many floor formation signals flashing, the question is, will this time be different?\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nNew Glassnode Homepage is live at Glassnode.com\nImprovements to Dashboards: Video module, textbox scroll feature, reformatted sizing.\nCloning workbench charts with description.\nNew Product Launch: Tutorial Dashboards\n\nWe are pleased to release four new pre-set dashboards, video guides, and Written notes designed to help Glassnode users explore and up-skill in on-chain concepts, starting with Bitcoin.\n\nTutorial 1 - Navigating Market Tops and Bottoms\nTutorial 2 - Introduction to On-chain Activity\nTutorial 3 - Fundamentals of Bitcoin Mining\nTutorial 4 - Introduction to Supply Dynamics\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nFalling Dominoes: Capitulations Across the Board\n\nThe Bitcoin market has reeled from a massive deleveraging event this week, falling below the 2017 $20k ATH. Both on-chain DeFi markets, and off-chain entities deleveraged, as exchanges, lenders, and hedge funds were rendered insolvent, illiquid, or liquidated.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nJun 20, 2022 • 10 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has reeled from a massive deleveraging event this week, both in on-chain DeFi markets and off-chain as exchanges, lenders and hedge funds being rendered insolvent, illiquid or liquidated. The market sold off below 2017 $20k ATH on 18-June, reaching a truly remarkable low of $17,708. Prices did, however, recover the $20k level on Sunday.\n\nWith Bitcoin and digital assets being the only tradeable instruments over the weekend, macro fears and demand for dollar liquidity appear to have been taken out of the space. As a result of this extreme deleveraging event, we have started to see signals of capitulation across a number of entities, including miners, Long-term holders, and the aggregate market.\n\nIn this edition, we will explore these various sectors to assess whether maximum pain has been reached or not.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Hebrew and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nRock Bottom Profitability\n\nWith the market trading below the $20k 2017 ATH, investor conviction and market profitability have been put to an extreme test.\n\nThe Realized Loss metric measures the total value delta between coins that were acquired at higher prices and the price when they were subsequently spent on-chain. Realized losses reached a new all-time-high, punctuated by three consecutive days with market-wide realized losses above $2.4B/day, totalling $7.325B. The profitability stress noted above appears to be playing out in investors actualizing the losses.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also investigate the profitability of specific investor cohorts relative to their realized price, which is the average price of all coins based on when they last moved on-chain. The chart below presents the MVRV Ratios for three Bitcoin cohorts (whole market, STHs and LTHs) which shows that all of them are now at a loss and holding coins below their cost basis on average.\n\nPrevious instances where all three cohorts are at an unrealized loss have coincided only with late stage bear market capitulations, providing confluence with the above profitability metrics.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nAs we covered in Week 23, a powerful tool for tracking bear market extension is the diminishing profitability across supply and wallet-based metrics. What we are seeking are the thresholds of ultimate investor financial pain which exhausted sellers in previous cycles.\n\nThese maximum pain thresholds in supply can be investigated from different dimensions:\n\nSupply in Profit 🔵 dropped to just 49.0% as the market traded down to $17.6k, putting more than half of the supply into an unrealized loss. Historical bear market floors have bottomed between 40% and 45% of supply in profit.\nAddresses in Profit 🟠 assesses the profitability among individual wallets and returns similar results to supply in profit. This metric is now just 10% higher than its lowest level in the 2018-2019 bear market and COVID crash, indicating just marginally less pain than at those bottoms.\nUTXOs in Profit 🟢 enables us to gauge the market profitability based on all unspent outputs. This metric shows that 26.7% of all unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) are in loss. Historically at the bottom of the bear markets, 50.2% - 81.1% of all UTXOs were in loss.\nLTH-Supply in Profit 🔴 monitors the profitability of long-term holders as a gauge of the severity of stress on Bitcoin's strongest-handed investors. At the moment, 35% of LTH-Supply is at a loss. This means this cohort is still shouldering less pain compared to past bear markets where LTHs held 42% to 51% of their supply in the loss.\n\nThere is an expected natural drift in the floor of these metrics as coins are lost and deep-HODLed over time. As such, the sell-off over the weekend can be considered to have plunged profitability and investors into a historically meaningful degree of financial pain.\n\nLive Workbench\nMiner Capitulation Happening in Real-Time\n\nA strong case can be made for Bitcoin to be considered a digital commodity, and like many commodities, it tends to have a relationship with its cost of production. By running a log-log regression model between Difficulty and Market Cap, we can estimate an all-in-sustaining cost for mined BTC.\n\nThis cost of the production model is currently trading at $17,600, which interestingly was the price low over the weekend.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nOur investigation in Week On-Chain 23 uncovered the stress on miners' incomes due to falling revenues and rising production costs. Miner behaviours now confirm that an ongoing miner capitulation phase is underway. The first piece of evidence is the hash-ribbons, which have now inverted, as hashrate falls 10% off the ATH and signifies mining ASIC rigs are coming offline.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can further validate that miner stress is in play using two tools:\n\nThe Puell Multiple is an oscillator tracking miner USD denominated income and currently indicates that aggregate revenues are 65% lower than their yearly average. From declining miner revenues, we can imply that miner stress is likely.\nThe Difficulty Ribbon Compression (normalized) then provides an explicit miner stress model, which like the hash-ribbons, monitors whether rigs are actually coming offline. Given we saw a recent uptrend in difficulty, we can also ascertain that the cost of production for BTC has increased.\n\nBased on these two models, the ongoing miner income contraction is worse than the Great Migration in May-July 2021. However, miners have faced worse days in 2018-2019 and 2014-2015 bear markets, where the Puell Multiple reached 0.31 (69% revenue decline vs yearly average).\n\nLive Workbench\n\nTo assess the probability of miner capitulation, we can combine these two metrics, seeking confluence between a Puell Multiple < 0.6 and Difficult Ribbon Compression < 0.06, distilled into the Miner Capitulation Tool (shown in yellow zones below).\n\nFurther bolstering this argument, we can also estimate the Realized Price for Miners (excluding the Patoshi coins) as a gauge for their mined balance cost basis, currently at $26,170.\n\nInterestingly, on multiple occasions, the highlighted capitulation zones overlapped with the periods when the market price has been traded below the estimated Realized Price for Miners. Over the recent market crash to $17.6k, this overlapping structure is noticed for the first time since the COVID crash.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWith this extensive financial pressure on miners, outflow volumes from their treasuries reached rates of between 5k to 8k BTC per month. This is now comparable with the 2018-2019 bear market capitulation event. Remarkably, after Bitcoin failed to hold its ongoing consolidation’s low band ($28k), miners stopped spending and actually saw balances increase at a rate of 2.2k BTC per month.\n\nLive Chart\nNew Glassnode Research: The Great DeFi Deleveraging\n\nThe Ethereum DeFi market is undergoing a dramatic deleveraging, with over $124B in capital flushed out in just six weeks. The Ethereum investor base is now heavily underwater on spot positions, and is locking in historically large realized losses.\n\nRead our latest research piece here.\n\nThe Great DeFi Deleveraging\nLong-Term Holders: On The Verge Capitulation\n\nThe falling dominoes of the current bear market are advancing to a new phase. Alongside miners, Long-Term Holders are now beginning to feel the pressure, forcing many of them to sell at an accelerating rate. Long-Term Holder Supply has declined by 178k BTC over the last week, equivalent to 1.31% of their total holdings.\n\nLive Chart\n\nRevived supply 1yr+ confirms that spending by older coins it taking place, accelerating to rates of 20k to 36k BTC per day. This reflects an influx of fear and panic within even Bitcoins' stronger hand cohort.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can map the motivating financial stress on Long-Term Holders using LTH-MVRV, a ratio between Market price and the LTH-Realized price. The recent market crash to $17.6k pushed this metric to 0.85, meaning LTHs, on average, are holding a 15% unrealized loss. This is a deeper low than was set during the COVID crash and just slightly above the 2018-2019 bear market capitulation bottom.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs Long-Term Holders, unrealized losses amplify, and the intensity of this selling-in-loss can be monitored by LTH-SOPR. This metric compares the market price with the cost basis of the LTHs spending coins each day.\n\nPast capitulations of LTHs have occurred when this metric trades below 1, signifying that LTHs are taking losses after long holding periods. At bear market lows, this metric has previously fallen into the 0.4 to 0.6 range, indicating 40% to 60% losses.\n\nThus, the current spending behaviour by LTHs taking losses coincides with March 2020 but is not quite as severe as the 2015 or 2018 bear market lows.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can also track the net coin distribution of LTHs over a 30-day period to assess relative sell-side activity. Here we normalize values by total LTH supply to gain a comparative overview of these investors' behaviour across previous bear markets.\n\nDuring the recent sharp drop, LTH investors have spent slightly more than 1% of their supply per month, a rate that coincident with the COVID crash and the post-ATH correction in December 2021. This level is almost two times higher than the 2018-2019 bear market maximum outflow.\n\nNote that maximum LTH outflows are actually associated with bull markets (taking profits) rather than bear markets (experienced investors panicking and taking losses).\n\nLive Workbench\nTracing Pain Into The Exchange\n\nExchanges remain the primary trading venue for Bitcoin and thus, characterizing the incoming coin flows can refine our observations of the market response to volatility and drawdowns. The following figure shows only instances where the weekly netflow to (red) or from (green) exchanges surpasses 1% of the Total Exchange Balances.\n\nReviewing the recent notable incidents:\n\nThe 2018-2019 bear market saw a regime of weekly inflows > +1% of total exchange balance persist for over one month.\nThe LUNA crash reached +4% of the total exchange balance in net inflows.\nThe current market has this metric returning a -2.8% net outflow which is similar to the post-COVID crash outflows.\n\nAs such, despite heavy downside price action, exchange balances saw a net balance depletion at a rate of 2.8% of the total this week.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nNext, we can characterize the profitability of inflows to exchanges by the degree of profit and loss realized. Exchange Inflows over the last month have been dominated by realized losses, with the total magnitude surpassing 1.5% of the market cap.\n\nThis exceeds the May-July 2021 sell-off, however, is around half as severe as the extreme lows in the 2018-2019 bear market and COVID crash.\n\nLive Chart in the Glassnode Engine Room\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nThe Bitcoin market has now experienced two distinct capitulation phases since the ATH in November 2021. The first phase was triggered by the Luna Foundation Guard force selling its 80k+ BTC, and the second this week via a massive industry-wide deleveraging, both on and off-chain.\n\nMiners are now under significant financial stress, with BTC trading near the estimated cost of production, incomes well below their yearly average, and hash-rate noticeably coming off ATHs. The aggregate market has realized over $7 Billion in losses this week, with Long-term Holders contributing some 178k BTC in additional sell-side.\n\nAs we have discussed in recent weeks (23 and 24), Bitcoin market participants across the board are at or very near historically high financial pain thresholds. With forced sellers appearing to drive much of the recent sell-side, the market might begin to eye whether signals of seller exhaustion are emerging over the coming weeks and months.\n\nNew Product Launch: Tutorial Dashboards\n\nWe are pleased to release four new pre-set dashboards, video guides, and Written notes designed to help Glassnode users explore and up-skill in on-chain concepts, starting with Bitcoin.\n\nTutorial 1 - Navigating Market Tops and Bottoms\nTutorial 2 - Introduction to On-chain Activity\nTutorial 3 - Fundamentals of Bitcoin Mining\nTutorial 4 - Introduction to Supply Dynamics\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nImprovements to Dashboards: Video module, textbox scroll feature, reformatted sizing\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Darkest Phase of the Bear\n\nWith Bitcoin prices selling off to the mid-$20ks, a plethora of macro indicators suggest the market is entering the deepest phase of this bear cycle. Fundamentals have deteriorated, and even Long-term Holders are now realising significant losses.\n\nUkuriaOC, Glassnode\nJun 13, 2022 • 11 min read\n\nBitcoin and digital assets have experienced yet another chaotic week of downside price action, losing the open of $31,693 and trading down to a new multi-year low of $25,150. Macro headwinds remain a large scale driver, with the latest US CPI print of 8.6% being above expectations and another 2y-10y US Treasury Bond yield curve inversion occurring in the early hours on Monday. This has been met with a large rally in the DXY, as Bitcoin closes with its 10th red candle in 11 weeks.\n\nBitcoin network utility continues to languish, with macro metrics like the RVT entering the uncharted bearish territory. Despite continued accumulation across Shrimps (< 1BTC) and Whales (> 10k BTC) alike, price support remains far from established. Despite many macro valuation metrics continuing to flag oversold conditions, Bitcoin remains correlated with traditional markets, with prices taking a beating accordingly.\n\nIn this edition, we explore how the current bear market is now entering a phase aligned with the deepest and darkest phases of previous bears. The market on average is barely above its cost basis, and even Long-Term Holders are now being purged from the holder base.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Hebrew and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report, which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nA Meeting With The Cost Basis\n\nWith the market trading into the mid-$20k region, it is approaching one of the most significant and fundamental on-chain metrics, the Realized Price. This metric represents the average price of every coin in the supply, valued at the time it was last spent on-chain.\n\nThe Realized Price (at $23,430) is rarely visited by spot prices outside the deepest and latest stages of bear markets. March 2020, and the end of the 2018 bear market were the last instances where the market was on aggregate holding an unrealized loss.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe MVRV Z-Score then compares this spot value of Bitcoin against Realized Price to obtain an oscillator. This tool can help to identify statistically meaningful deviations away from this ‘intrinsic value’ and is used to assess over and undervalued conditions.\n\nValues equal to the mean (black line) typically align with these deep late stage bears. The current market has now fallen to just +0.26 standard deviations above the mean, which historically would be considered a value zone, especially so when weighted for an upwards drift in Z-score.\n\nNevertheless, past bear cycles have shown that negative MVRV-Z values are often seen before a bear market concludes and can persist in that state for some time (order of months in 2018 to a year IN 2015).\n\nLive Workbench\nBitcoin HODLers Soften Up\n\nWithin the structural downtrend that has been in place since November, we have seen a variety of behavioural phases and Bitcoin spending behaviour taking place. We can use these changes in behaviour to gauge how aggregated investor sentiment has changed.\n\nThe Accumulation Trend Score is a useful tool to observe these changes by assessing the magnitude and duration of on-chain Bitcoin balance growth or contraction. It displays the aggregate accumulation/distribution weighted for all cohorts.\n\nDec 2020 to Jan 2021 - Bull market buying, as investors entered the market and created the bullish impulse to the then $64k ATH.\nJan 2021 to Oct 2021 - Softening and general distribution, in part a result of declining spot demand after the GBTC premium turned to a discount (covered in our report here)\nOct 2021 to Jan 2022 - Post ATH buying demand which was later redistributed (as covered in Week 9, 2022)\nJan 2022 to May 2022 - Intermittent accumulation and distribution, culminating in the LUNA-UST motivated sell-off (as covered in Week 20, 2022).\n\nIn the current market, we have seen one month with an Accumulation Trend Score north of 0.8, signifying high positive balance changes across the market. This is a notable shift from the intermittent accumulation before the LUNA sell-off and may suggest an improved investor perception of value at prices at and below $30k.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nWe can also look toward the Liveliness metric to understand the market preference for HODLing or distributional behaviour. Liveliness defines the balance between aggregate Coin Day Destruction and Coin Day Creation. It can therefore be used to provide confluence with destruction and accumulation regimes.\n\nLiveliness has remained in a structural downtrend since August 21. Bitcoin is firmly within a regime of aggregate Coin Day Creation as HODLing dominates. However, as we have explored in previous editions, with only the HODLer class remaining, their demand side remains too light to contain the current action sell-side.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can further confirm this by assessing the 3-month position change for Liveliness (shown in purple below). A general accumulation range can also be highlighted since the Great Miner Migration in Jul 2021. However, this Coin Day Creation regime is losing momentum and trending toward an equilibrium position based on the current trend. This reflects the general uncertainty in markets, which is resulting in increased investor de-risking of spot positions.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe HODLer net position change brings these observations into the supply domain, and can be used to estimate the magnitude of coin volume HODLer base is accumulating or distributing. This metric indicates that based on the degree of coin dormancy at present, approximately 15k-20k BTC per month are transitioning into the hands of Bitcoin HODLers. This has declined by around 64% since early May, suggesting a weakening accumulation response.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe have seen changing phases of investor conviction and spending behaviour over the last 18-months. In particular, we have identified that in both instances at the $30k level (May-July 2021 and currently), the investor buy-side sentiment appears to be stronger than any other price level in this cycle.\n\nA Bifurcated Market\n\nWe have established that investors do appear to perceive value in the sub-$30k region, despite this demand being insufficient thus far in providing price support. Next will break down which cohorts have been participating in the accumulation to further refine these observations.\n\nThe Trend Accumulation Score by Cohort allows a more granular assessment into which wallet-size cohorts are accumulating/distributing and to what degree.\n\nShrimps (<1 BTC) and Whales (>10k BTC, excl. exchanges and miners) cohorts have been aggressively accumulating since the price slump into the $25k-$32k range. This remains in effect throughout the last 2 months of depressed prices.\nCrabs to Sharks (1 to 100 BTC) cohorts have transitioned from a neutral to a distributive phase during the current sell-off. This suggests a potential decline in confidence.\n\nThus the near-perfect scores of 0.9+ seen in the Accumulation Trend Score over recent weeks are being driven by the very large (>10k BTC) and relatively small (<1 BTC) cohorts. It is interesting to note that the whale entities were the driving distributors at the $45k to $35k levels (Zone A) and are currently one of the prime accumulators in the $25k to $32k range (Zone B).\n\nLive Metric in the Glassnode Engine Room\n\nNext, we can assess the 30-day rate of change of supply held by shrimp addresses with less than 1 BTC. The 30-day rate of change provides insight into the raw position change to the number of coins held by this smaller and likely retail-level cohort of investors.\n\nAlthough the current rate of balance growth is waning, it was preceded by the most aggressive and consistent accumulation period post-Bitcoin’s initial rise in the last 18-months. These smallholders have seen a net balance growth of +20,863 Bitcoin since the May 9th Luna crash, providing confluence with Accumulation Trend Score by Cohort.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nOn an absolute magnitude basis, Shrimps have added +96.3k BTC to their holdings since the Nov ATH. This equates to 0.451% of the circulating supply, and 48.6% of new coin issuance over the same period.\n\nWe can visibly see the steepening positive gradient of shrimp owned supply. These small holders appear unfazed, rightly or wrongly, by the prevailing downtrend, as they continue to constantly accumulate spot BTC.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe other cohort of interest to assess is the 10k+ BTC Whale cohort. Looking at the monthly position change of their addresses, we can support our previous observations that the cohort has also been accumulating throughout the $25k-$32k price range. This cohort has a monthly position change peak of ~140k BTC/month, increasing their balance by adding +306,358 BTC since the Nov 2021 ATH.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe Entity-Adjusted Unspent Realized Price Distribution by wallet cohort examines the price points where this supply distribution was last transacted, and by which wallet cohort.\n\nAround the $30k and $40k price buckets, we can see significant supply clusters associated with a diverse range of wallet cohorts, indicating these two price ranges experienced significant volumes of supply changing hands. However, there is little coin volume transacted between $27k and $20k, which may manifest as a region of high volatility, and potentially little support.\n\nLive Chart in the Glassnode Engine Room\nThe Deterioration of Fundamentals\n\nThe RVT Ratio compares the Realized Capitalization against the daily volume settled On-Chain, this provides insight into the daily utilization of the network (On-Chain volume) relative to its intrinsic value (Realized Cap). A general framework for the interpretation of the RVT is:\n\nHigh values and uptrends indicate poor utilization and a slow-down in-network utilization.\nLow values and downtrends indicate high utilization and an uptick in-network utilization.\nStable sideways values indicate that the current utilization trend is likely sustainable and in equilibrium.\n\nThe red band denotes an RVT ratio of 80 or above, suggesting the network valuation is now 80 times larger than the daily value settled. This is indicative of a barren on-chain activity landscape, which is historically a result of extended bearish price action, flushing cost-sensitive participants from the network.\n\nIn past bear cycles, an underutilized network has provided confluence with bear market bottoms. Should network utilization increase and RVT manages to break lower, it may signal improving fundamentals. However, with the RVT ratio currently at its highest value since 2010, a continued break higher would enter the somewhat uncharted bearish territory, where network valuation is even more 'overvalued' relative to network activity.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nThe Entity Adjusted Dormancy Flow model can also be used to compare Market Valuation to network utilization from the perspective of the average coin age being spent in the network. Dormancy measures the average amount of Coin Days Destroyed on a per coin transacted basis. Dormancy Flow then compares the Market Capitalisation to Dormancy (in USD terms), thus capturing deviations in spending behaviour against the market valuation.\n\nDormancy Flow continues to trade at historical lows, suggesting that the market valuation is low relative to the time weighted on-chain transaction volume. Previous instances of Dormancy flow at these levels have typically coincided with bear market capitulation events and periods of maximum pain.\n\nIn line with the weakening Liveliness and HODLer performance, this aligns with a condition where even the oldest Bitcoin holders were purged from the network.\n\nLive Chart\nA Purging Of Even the Strongest Hands\n\nLong Term Holders and Short Term Holders are dichotomous by nature and thus value different things.\n\nShort Term Holders are statistically more sensitive to price volatility, as their cost basis is much closer to the current spot price.\nLong Term Holders generally represent the HODLer cohort, whom are relatively price-insensitive. This cohort is more likely to weather volatility and price drawdowns in the pursuit of long term value (covered in last weeks edition).\n\nThe Spent Price is a model that represents the average cost basis of coins that were spent each day. This can be split to analyze the LTH and STH components to identify divergences between their spending behaviours. It is uncommon for the LTH cohort to spend coins with a higher average cost basis than their sister STH cohort, however this does occur when entering a deep capitulation zone, where even the strongest hands are purged from the asset.\n\nThe chart below compares the spent price of LTH to STH, and we can see that LTHs are currently spending coins with a higher cost basis than STHs. Previous instances of this have coincided with deep bear market finales, lasting between 52-days (2020) and 514-days (2014-15) and accompanied by additional drawdowns in the price of -40% to -65%.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nComparing the aggregate market cost basis (Realized Price) to the LTH-Cost Basis shows that the two are currently converging. The LTH cohort usually has the lowest On-Chain cost basis, and this directly ties in with their trading ideology of buying low prices in value zones thus, their aggregate purchase is lower.\n\nTherefore, with the LTH cost basis approaching the aggregate cost basis (from below), it is an indication that the current holdings of the 'smart money' cohort have not outcome the broader market. Previous instances where LTH Realized Price is higher than aggregate Realized Price also coincide with the deepest phases of a bear market.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe Bitcoin market has entered a phase coincident with the deepest and darkest bear cycles of the past. Prices barely hold above the aggregate cost basis as captured by the Realized price, and on-chain volume fundamentals have deteriorated further. Historically, this phase has taken on the order of 8 to 24 months to pass by as the market hammers out a final bottom.\n\nOf the highest note is that Long-Term holders are currently spending coins with a higher cost basis than Short-Term holders, and their cost basis is barely more profitable than the aggregate market. In the past, this has signalled the start of the final and painful wash-out phase of all remaining sellers, unfortunately, accompanied by a further 40% to 64% price decline.\n\nAll eyes are on the conviction and support provided by the Bitcoin HODLer class now.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nRelease new dashboard for pro users: GN engine room\nAdded 5y zoom option to dashboards metrics cards.\nImprovements applied to Workbench if function.\nSimplified save actions on the Workbench page and added on-click Price option.\nUncharted Newsletter Edition #17 released.\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on-chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on-chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Furthermore, miners appear to experiencing some income stress, with revenues falling, whilst production costs climb.\n\nCryptoVizArt, Glassnode\nJun 6, 2022 • 10 min read\n\nComing out of a bloody nine consecutive red weeks, the market closed its first weekly candle in the green, albeit with a relatively uninspiring weekly gain of 1.57%. The market traded between a weekly high of $31,900 and a low of $29,375.\n\nWith prices trading at the lower end of the 2021-22 cycle range, the vast majority of buyers from the last 17-months are now holding unrealized losses. The intensity of this uncertainty and stress in the market is observable in on-chain data, with a continual reliance on Long-Term Holders to shoulder the load.\n\nWe are also seeing miner revenues decline substantially, despite the climbing difficulty. This suggests that miner operations have expanded, capital has been spent, and production costs have increased as revenues are falling off. As profit multiples compress across the board and financial stress increases, the highest probability is that the market is within the second and historically final capitulation phase of a Bitcoin bear market.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, Hebrew and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further on our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nHistorical Macro Lows\n\nAmong all models mapping the value zones in Bitcoin market, two simple but powerful indicators have been utilized widely by analysts alike; the Mayer Multiple and Realized Price.\n\nThe Mayer Multiple is an oscillator defined as the ratio between price and the 200-day moving average. Therefore the Mayer Multiple represents the deviation from this long-term average price as a tool to gauge overbought and oversold conditions incorporating data points encompassing Bitcoin’s lifespan.\n\nFollowing the original analysis, oversold or undervalued conditions have coincided with the Mayer Multiple falling in the range of 0.6-0.8. These multiples are applied to the 200DMA in the following chart to demonstrate the undervalued zones according to Mayer Multiple; 0.6 MM < Price < 0.8 MM.\n\nThroughout the past four bear markets, market prices have entered this value range in two distinguishable phases:\n\nPhase A- Early in the bear market, as the initial post-ATH sell-off causes investors to panic\nPhase B Late-stage bear market as the market enters the bottom formation and capitulation\n\nIn the current market, prices have been hovering inside this value zone ($25,200 to $33,700) since 5-May, more closely resembling Phase B of the previous bear cycles. From a probabilistic view, Bitcoin prices have only closed below a Mayer Multiple of 0.8 for 7.9% of trading days.\n\nLive Workbench \n\nThe Realized Price Model is the former macro indicator to map the cycle bottoms. The Realized Price is currently trading at $23,600 and represents the estimated average cost basis of all coins in the Bitcoin supply, based on the price when they last moved on-chain. In previous bear market cycles, when spot prices traded below the Realized Price, it signalled elevated probabilities of a macro low being established.\n\nHistorically, the overall market cost basis or realized price has been a very sound cycle support level, with 84.9% of Bitcoin trading days closing above this level. In other words, only 15.1% of trading days have closed below the Realized Price, providing a similar confluence with the Mayer Multiple of 0.8.\n\nLive Workbench\nA Prolonged Bear Market & Profitability\n\nHaving now assessed past bear market structure to model a potential cycle bottom zone, the confidence of this claim can be queried by quantifying the degree of ‘Bear Market pain’ felt across the network. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric maps out the overall unrealized profit and loss of the network as a proportion of the market cap. Thus NUPL can be used as a compass to assess this market pain threshold.\n\nSince early May, the NUPL has fluctuated in a compressed range of 18.6% to 25.0%, indicating less than 25% of the market cap is held in profit. This resembles a market structure equivalent to pre-capitulation phases in previous bear markets. In the event of a capitulation, the NUPL has usually traded down to an unrealized loss of up to -25% times the Market Cap. Given the current realized price of $23,600, the matching price range of $23,600 to $20,560 is where NUPL would imply a full-scale capitulation scenario.\n\nIt is worth noting that NUPL cycle lows have been gradually climbing as a result of both lost and long HODLed coins. This impact may well be further intensified by the introduction of derivatives, which enable the hedging of risk without selling spot exposure.\n\nLive Chart\n\nSince NUPL tracks the unrealized profit and loss in the market, we can supplement with an investigation of the Realized Losses to gauge the actual investor response. Here, the Cumulative Realized Loss (90D) is presented as a ratio with the Realized Cap to normalize for market size. Consistent with the highlighted two-phase bear market pattern in the Mayer Multiple models, the cumulative realized loss chart also is denoting two stages in a bear market.\n\nThe early wave of losses of the current cycle has already been realized via the post ATH crash in May-July 2021 (phase A). At the moment, the market is experiencing phase B where the probability of a capitulation event taking place is elevated, and sustained losses are being realized on-chain.\n\nLive Workbench\nLong-Term Holders Shoulder Losses\n\nOne of the outstanding trends of a bear market is the diminishing share of short-term holders (STHs), as speculators are flushed from the market. As a result, STHs end up holding fewer coins, and Long-Term Holders accumulate and dominate the circulating supply. This trend is the result of two parallel events occurring during a bear market:\n\nPhase A: Short-term holders who purchased near the top are immediately plunged into a loss, reducing their overall Supply in Profit.\nPhase B: Long-Term Holder accumulation persists during the bear, despite prices pushing their newly acquired coins into an unrealized loss.\n\nAt the moment, almost 58% of the circulating supply is in profit while in the last three market capitulations this metric fell down to <50% levels. STH-Supply in profit is just 2.2% meaning the short-term holders are almost entirely at a loss. Meanwhile, LTHs have seen their share of profitable supply drop from 68.5% in April to 55.7% today, indicating they are currently shouldering much of the market's unrealized losses.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo add a new dimension to this observation, we can look into the share of Supply in Profit Held By Long-Term Holders. Here, the growing dominance of long-term holders (or diminishing share of short-term holders) through the late stages of a bear market are noticeable.\n\nIn the last two extended bear markets, the 14 DMA of this metric broke above the 90% threshold line. This means under the psychological pressure of bearish price action, short-term holders were holding < 10% of the profit in the market. With the recent leg down to sub $30K range, this metric crossed over the 90% threshold. Above this level, STHs have essentially reached a near-peak pain threshold, with almost no unrealized profits held while LTHs dominating the remaining profitable supply.\n\nLive Workbench\n\nMoreover, the examination of the unrealized loss distribution among LTHs and STHs suggests the following findings of the current cycle:\n\nPrice currently is trading at the lows of the 2021-2022 cycle, which means almost all buyers since Jan-2021 are now holding unrealized losses.\nThe LTH supply in loss has been increasing since May 2021 but has since plateaued at 26% of supply (vs. STHs with 16%). This indicates that LTHs are shouldering more of the unrealized losses (a constructive reshuffling of coin ownership), and currently holds around 62% of the 2021-22 cycle supply in loss (26% / (26%+16%)).\nSTH Supply in loss is also approximately stable, oscillating around 16% to 18% of supply. Note that 155-days ago (1-Jan-2022) the price was $47k. Thus the majority of STHs accumulated throughout the previous consolidation range in Q1 2022.\nLive Chart\n\nThe behavioural analysis of the LTHs under pressure would not be concluded without examining their reaction to intense price corrections. Here we will inspect the Return Bands of Long-Term Holders’ Realized Profit & Loss metric, specifically for coins deposited into exchanges. In the 2018-19 bear market and the March 2020 Covid crash, the aggregated realized loss exceeded 0.006% of the market cap. This pattern has now reoccurred during the plunge below $30K in early May. To lay a foundation for this investigation, we should emphasize that:\n\nThe LTH losses on coins deposited to exchanges have now reached a magnitude comparable to previous bear markets. However, we do not yet have the duration component, and also the drawdown magnitude is 58% relative to previous >75% drawdowns.\nMiner Earnings Under Stress\n\nAfter determining the severity of the current bear market and exploring the long-term holders’ corresponding behaviour, we will now assess the reaction of miners to declining incomes.\n\nTo lay a foundation for this analysis we first have to quantify the profitability of the market from the miners’ perspective. The Puell Multiple is the ratio of the daily issuance value of bitcoin (in USD) to the 365-day moving average of this value.\n\nAssessing the entire history of Puell Multiple, the two-phase-bear market narrative outlined above is also evident here. At the early stages of the bear market, the Puell Multiple typically falls into the range of 0.6 to 1.0, indicating current incomes are up to 40% lower than the last year on average. Subsequently, in the later stages of a prolonged bear market where the capitulation events tend to take place, the Puell Multiple plunges to the sub-0.5 zone.\n\nThis metric is currently sitting at 0.66, on the edge of entering the capitulation range. Taking the high correlation between this indicator and price into account, a price decline of -10% or more would indicate widespread stress on miner income streams.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn reaction to the prevailing decline in USD incomes since November 2021, we can observe miner balances declining and additional spending taking place. The Miner Net Position Change metric is currently indicating an aggregate miner balance reduction of between 5k and 8k BTC per month.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis signals a distinct change in miner behaviour, as their balance had seen a net accumulation of around 12k BTC during the first drawdown from ATH. In response to the market crash due to LUNA Foundation selling over 80k BTC in an attempt to maintain the UST peg, miners have since distributed 10k BTC adding to the selling pressure in the market.\n\nLive Chart\nA Chronological Divergence\n\nAn intriguing divergence to discuss is the continued climbing of network difficulty, which has risen by 132% since the ATH, despite the financial incentive of total miner revenue dropping by 56.7%. This substantial jump in difficulty suggests that existing miners have expanded their operations, and new miners have joined the network despite a massive income reduction. As such it is likely that recent capital expenses on mining hardware and facilities could add continued pressure to miners’ balance sheets.\n\nLive Workbench\nSummary and Conclusion\nBased on the Mayer Multiple, and the Realized Price, the market has now pushed Bitcoin prices down to levels that have been seen for less than 15% of Bitcoins trading days.\nNetwork unrealized losses are hovering in the twilight zone of late-stage bear markets, however, are not yet signalling complete capitulation. With prices at the lower bound of the 2021-22 cycle, all buyers since 1-Jan-2021 are now underwater.\nLong-Term Holders are currently shouldering the majority (62%) of unrealized losses, signifying that a gradual but constructive change of ownership has taken place throughout this bear market.\nMiners appear to be increasingly under stress, with signs of both balance sheet reduction alongside recent operation expansion expressed through rising difficulty. This means that each coin is now more expensive to mine, whilst the USD denominated reward continues to decline and may portend a potential miner capitulation cycle ahead.\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nAdded shift, if-then, and corrfunctions to workbench. returns function has been renamed as percent_change.\nNew Ethereum Breakdown metrics Gas Usage absolute, Gas usage relative, Transaction type absolute, Transaction type relative\nNew pre-set dashboard: Exploring the etherverse\nRelease new dashboard for pro users: GN engine room\nReleased Whale Activity Metrics; Volume To Exchanges, Volume From Exchanges, Transfers To Exchanges, Transfers From Exchanges\nUncharted Newsletter Edition #16 released.\nNew Research: A Short History of the Etherverse\n\nEthereum is a permissionless platform, and as such, doesn't have an inherent purpose that is enforceable.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nHardened HODLers Double Down\n\nIn the aftermath of the sell-off in early May, a noteworthy shift in accumulation trends is underway. The Bitcoin HODLer class remain the only ones left, however their accumulation behaviour signals a doubling down as prices correct below $30k.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nMay 30, 2022 • 10 min read\n\nBitcoin prices continued to consolidate this week, after initial signs of a potential decoupling between digital asset markets, and traditional equity markets, albeit in the wrong direction. The S&P500 index rallied 7.4% from the lows this week, and the NASDAQ was up 9.6%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin traded down to a low of $28,261, and only rallied early on Monday to recover the weekly high of $30,710. Ethereum also had a tough week, shedding 17.8% of its value to a low of $1,700, before rebounding to $1,900 on Monday morning.\n\nAfter the LUNA motivated sell-off event earlier in the month, there has been a distinct behavioural change in Bitcoin on-chain accumulation trends. In particular, entities with balances < 100 BTC, and those with >10k BTC have been significant accumulators. The remaining wallet cohorts have also transitioned from net distributors, to neutral. This reflects a notable shift in behaviour compared to the Feb-mid May period which was intermittent accumulation and distribution, reflecting uncertainty and a rotating capital.\n\nHowever, on-chain activity remains extremely soft, with little signal of new interest in the asset outside the existing HODLer base. That said, the HODLers who remain, appear to be willing to double down as prices fall, and remain unwilling to spend coins, even if held at a loss.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further on our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nOnly the HODLers Remain\n\nOver recent months, we have highlighted how the on-chain activity for Bitcoin remains both lacklustre, and stable. This is a typical characteristic of past bear markets, where the transaction activity of the network is dominated by the HODLer class, who are far more price insensitive.\n\nAfter the May 2021 sell-off, we witnessed a modest 'purge' of wallets, as investors completely emptied out their coin holdings. This was followed by four month long plateau in wallet growth as uncertainty crept into investor psychology, and marginal buyers were flushed out of the market by the drawdown.\n\nAs we can see in the chart below, the poor price performance of late has put wallet growth on a near term pause, although not on the same scale as in May 2021.\n\nLive Chart\n\nDuring highly volatile events like the LUNA inspired sell-off, we often see an uptick in on-chain activity, as investors panic, sell, or otherwise move coins to post margin and cover positions. In March 2020 and November 2018, this upswing in activity post sell-off initiated the subsequent bull runs.\n\nWhilst this possibility cannot be ruled out, we can see that both Active Addresses and Entities have 'given back' all of this upswing in activity, and returned to the range established since Sept 2021. In other words, the recent sell-off, and lower prices has not yet inspired an influx of new users to the space, and only the HODLers remain.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nA Shift in Accumulation Behaviour\n\nOf course on-chain activity is only a part of the story. Whilst wallet growth and active entities may be stagnant, this analysis does not account for the economic value of the investors and wallets that remain. As prices correct lower, the ability for HODLers to acquire more BTC per dollar increases, which leads us to investigate the domain of supply dynamics.\n\nThe Accumulation Trend Score has seen a noteworthy shift in behaviour. For almost 2-weeks, it has returned near perfect score above 0.9. This indicates that existing entities on the network are adding significantly to their holdings. This is a clear break from the intermittent scores returned during the Jan-April consolidation range (orange) which can reasonably be classified as relatively low conviction accumulation.\n\nPrevious instances of sustained high accumulation trend scores fall into two buckets:\n\nHigh scores during a bull-run (blue) - which usually occur near tops as the smart money distribute their balance, but are matched with an even larger influx of less experienced new buyers.\nHigh scores during bearish trends (green) - which generally trigger after very significant corrections in price, as investor psychology shifts from uncertainty, to value accumulation. A notable exception is the post ATH period of Dec 2021 where 'the dip' turned out to not be THE dip, and many of these coins were redistributed lower at a loss.\nLive Chart\n\nIf we dissect the various wallet cohorts whom are contributing to this high accumulation score, we can identify two particular groups: entities with <100 BTC, and entities with >10k BTC.\n\nInspecting the former, we can see that the gradient of their aggregate wallet holdings increased following the recent sell-off. Furthermore, the aggregate balance of this cohort has increased by 80,724 BTC, remarkably similar to the net 80,081 BTC liquidated by the LUNA Foundation Guard (details here). In effect, the increased demand from < 100 BTC entities at lower prices has offset in the supply liquidated by LFG in the attempt to defend the UST peg.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThe other cohort which has contributed to the high Accumulation Trend Score are whales with > 10k BTC holdings. Over the course of May, these entities have added 46,269 BTC to their balance, and note that this includes the distribution of 80k BTC from the LFG wallet.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThese observations can be largely confirmed by inspection of the Accumulation Trend Score breakdown by wallet cohorts metric. Here we can see that since the sell-off, entities holding < 100 BTC and >10k BTC have returned blue signals indicating a significant increase to their balance in recent weeks.\n\nThis is a notable shift from the relatively weak values (yellow-red) during the lead-up to the sell-off, with Whales in particular being large scale distributors. The remaining wallet cohorts with 100-10k BTC have maintained a more neutral rating around 0.5, suggesting relatively little net change to their holdings.\n\nIn the next section, we will investigate the behaviour of the Long-term Holders to further refine our observations.\n\nLive Metric in the Glassnode Engine Room\nProduct Launch: The Glassnode Engine Room\n\nWelcome to the Glassnode Engine Room, a new product release for our Professional and Institutional members. This suite of exclusive image metrics provides an inside look at the research, innovation and experimentation happening behind the scenes. Engine Room metrics are designed to inspect increasingly bespoke segments of market and network data. Examples include:\n\nBreaking down the URPD into Age, Wallet, and LTH-STH cohorts.\nProfit and Loss bands by cohort and age.\nAccumulation Trend Score by wallet cohort.\n\nYou will find the Glassnode Engine room located under the Bitcoin category in your list of pre-set dashboards. We look forward to releasing new metrics, research, and concepts to the Engine Room on a semi-regular basis, and to hearing your feedback in the Professionals Lounge on Forum.\n\nLong-Term Losses\n\nWe have now established a case for the various wallet size cohorts that participated in recent accumulation on-chain. Next we turn to the Long-Term Holders, whom represent the least likely to spend during volatility to gauge investor conviction. Note that the transition into Long-Term Holder status is approximately 155-days ago, which is located in late December when prices were at ~$47k.\n\nIf we take a look at the URPD metric on 1-Apr-2022, prior to the LUNA sell-off, we can map out the coin distribution profile with a focus on on the 2021-22 cycle.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe now bring this 1-Apr profile and overlay it with today's URPD in blue below. From this we can assess the change in coin distribution and make the following observations:\n\nA sizeable reallocation of 1.5M BTC has occurred from buyers largely in the $42k to $49k range, down to buyers in the current range of $26.7k to $33k.\nThe coin distribution elsewhere remains remarkably similar to the 1-Apr profile, suggesting the relatively price insensitive HODLer cohort continues to dominate the Bitcoin investor profile.\nLive Chart\n\nThe current downtrend in coins younger than 3-months supports this observation. Looking back 3-months captures all coins last spent after 1-March, which is the middle the last consolidation range. When a downtrend in 3m old HODL waves is in effect, it means that on net, coin supply is migrating up to more senior age bans.\n\nThe key takeaway from these two metrics is that the coin holders who accumulated after the Nov ATH appear to be relatively price insensitive. Despite continued drawdowns in price, and a major spot liquidation event of 80k+ BTC, they remain unwilling to let their coins go.\n\nLive Chart\n\nRecalling that the Long-Term Holder threshold is located in late-December, it is no surprise that the total LTH supply has plateaued of late. For the last few months, the LTH threshold was traversing along the downtrend that was in play from Nov-Jan.\n\nTypically, supply accumulation occurs during sideways price ranges. This means that in around 1-month time, the LTH threshold will enter the previous consolidation range established between $33k and $42k. Based on the URPD profile, a very large volume of supply was acquired here between January and April.\n\nLong-Term Holder supply has recently returned to the ATH of 13.048M BTC. Unless significant coin redistribution occurs, we can therefore expect this supply metric to commence climbing over the course of the next 3-4 months, suggesting HODLers continue to gradually soak up, and hold onto supply.\n\nLive Chart\n\nHowever, despite the constructive forward view, there remains a sub-set of LTHs whom are currently spending coins and realizing losses. The LTH-SOPR metric can be viewed as the average profit multiple realized by the LTH cohort each day, and it rarely trades below 1.0.\n\nThis week, we have seen the average LTH spent coin locking in a 27% loss compared to the point of coin acquisition. Such events in the past have only occurred during the final capitulation lows of bear markets such as 2015, 2018 and briefly in March 2020.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWith the concept of LTH-SOPR as a realized profit multiple, we can thus derive the average price from where LTH spent coins are 'coming from', termed the Spent Price. The LTH Spent Price (pink) rarely trades above the market price, but however is currently trading at $32.8k on a 7-day moving average basis. The last time LTHs locked in losses like this was briefly following the March 2020 sell-off event. In the case of the 2018 bear, this preceded many months of LTH losses and culminated in an additional 50% price decline.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe plateauing on-chain activity for Bitcoin has been in effect since September 2021, and as yet, there are few signs of this changing course. What this indicates is that the HODLer class, the Bitcoin buyers of last resort, and the only ones that remain. This can also be observed in the unwillingness to spend held supply, even if it is now held at a loss.\n\nA notable shift occurred in on-chain accumulation trends following the LUNA induced sell-off. Entities with < 100BTC appear to have soaked up an equivalent coin volume to that sold in distress by the Luna Foundation Guard. Alongside a majority of Long-Term Holders an increasingly large volume of BTC appears HODLed and acquired at these lower prices. This trend, unless disrupted, can be expected to propel Long-Term Holder supply above its ATH over the coming months.\n\nKeeping both eyes on the macro environment which Bitcoin remains within, there are signals of a decoupling between digital assets and equities. Whether renewed correlation returns remains to be seen, and as does the ultimate direction of markets in reaction to monetary tightening. Risks of significant scale remain, however, impressively,  so does the population of price insensitive Bitcoin HODLers.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nAdded shift, if-then, and corrfunctions to workbench. returns function has been renamed as percent_change.\nNew Ethereum Breakdown metrics Gas Usage absolute, Gas usage relative, Transaction type absolute, Transaction type relative\nNew pre-set dashboard: Exploring the etherverse\nRelease new dashboard for pro users: GN engine room\nReleased Whale Activity Metrics; Volume To Exchanges, Volume From Exchanges, Transfers To Exchanges, Transfers From Exchanges\nUncharted Newsletter Edition #16 released.\nNew Research: A Short History of the Etherverse\n\nEthereum is a permissionless platform, and as such, doesn't have an inherent purpose that is enforceable.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Bear of Diminishing Returns\n\nPrice performance over the last 12 months has been nothing short of lacklustre, putting a dent in long-term CAGR rates for Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is supported by a dwindling demand for both chains blockspace, as expressed in on-chain fee markets.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nMay 23, 2022 • 10 min read\n\nAfter the industry-wide sell-off alongside the collapse of LUNA and UST last week, markets have entered a period of consolidation. Bitcoin prices traded within a relatively tight range between a high of $31,300 and a low of $28,713.\n\nThe Bitcoin market has now traded lower for eight consecutive weeks, which is now the longest continuous string of red weekly candles in history. This week we will look towards the return profile on both a short-term (monthly) and long-term (4yrs) basis for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. From this, we can see that the current drawdown has put a notable dent in the market performance of the asset-class as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, an assessment of derivative markets suggests fear of further downside remains the outlook, at least for the next three to six months. Looking on-chain, we can see that both Ethereum and Bitcoin blockspace demand has fallen to multi-year lows, and the rate of burning of ETH via EIP1559 is now at an all-time-low.\n\nCoupling poor price performance, fearful derivatives pricing, and exceedingly lacklustre demand for block-space on both Bitcoin and Ethereum, we can deduce that the demand side is likely to continue seeing headwinds.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further on our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nAre Returns for BTC and ETH Diminishing?\n\nThere has been a general consensus formed that with growing market valuation, the return profiles for Bitcoin can generally be expected to diminish. This reflects a number of factors that include (but not limited to):\n\nLarger market sizes requiring more capital to move in either direction.\nIntroduction of institutional capital, more advanced trading strategies, and derivatives for hedging and capturing volatility.\nCompression of information asymmetries, and a better appreciation of risk, performance, correlations and cycle behaviour.\n\nBitcoin has historically traded within an approximately 4yr bull/bear cycle, often associated with the halving events. The chart below plots out the rolling 4yr Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for Bitcoin.\n\nWe can now visualise this long-term compression of returns, with CAGR having declined from 200%+ in 2015, to less than 50% today. In particular, we can see the marked decline in 4y-CAGR following the May 2021 sell-off, which we have argued was likely the genesis point of the prevailing bear market trend.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nIn the shorter term, we can also see that the Monthly Return profile for Bitcoin has been underwhelming, with a negative performance of -30%. In effect, Bitcoin has lost 1% of its market value every day over the last month.\n\nThis negative return is now marginally worse than it was during the 4-Dec deleveraging, but not quite as severe as in May-July. Periods of time with monthly returns this lacklustre are relatively infrequent, however are almost always associated with high volatility drawdown events such as the beginning, and ends of bear markets.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can see a very similar return profile for Ethereum over recent months, although with relatively poorer performance of -34.9%. This demonstrates that correlation of performance between these two assets remains strong, despite numerous differences in their fundamental properties.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFurther to this, we can see an interesting coupling between Bitcoin and Ethereum CAGR performance, specifically during bearish trends. In the post March 2020 period of uncertainty, and again since the bear began in May 2021, the CAGR profiles of both assets have converged. Ethereum appears to also be experiencing a diminishing return profile over time.\n\nETH has generally outperformed BTC during bullish trends, however these divergences do appear to be getting weaker over time (lower upwards divergences). In more bearish trends, it can be seen that the ETH CAGR often tends to underperform BTC.\n\nOver the last 12-months, the 4yr CAGR for both assets has declined from around 100%/yr to just 36%/yr for BTC, and 28%/yr for ETH, highlighting the severity of this bear.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nWhilst Bitcoin remains the largest digital asset by market valuation, it exists within an ever evolving ecosystem of blockchains, coins, protocols, and tokens. Ethereum, being the second market leader for many years now, is often viewed as a bell-weather of market appetite for rest of the digital asset risk curve.\n\nA popular tool for tracking this relative performance and sector rotation is 'Bitcoin Dominance'. The dominance variant below considers only the relative performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum Market Caps. This attempts to distil this macro 'sector rotation' into very specific large-cap relative performance metric. From this we can make a few observations:\n\nDeclining BTC Dominance Divergence (green arrows) is typical of early-mid stage bull markets, as investors start moving further out on the risk curve.\nRising BTC Dominance Divergence (red arrows) is typical of earlier stage bear markets where risk appetite declines, and Bitcoin tends to outperform.\n\nIn the current market, and following the Nov ATH, we have seen a developing divergence in favour of BTC dominance. Given the negative attention drawn to the digital asset risk curve by the collapse of LUNA and UST, this trend may be one to keep track of. It should be noted that Ethereum dominance has remained higher for longer relative to the 2018 bear market, suggesting an improved market appreciation of ETH with age and maturity.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nDerivatives Expecting Further Downside\n\nMoving over to the derivatives markets, we can see another coupling between BTC and ETH exists, this time in futures cash-and-carry yields. Throughout the 2020-22 cycle, an approximately equal 3M rolling yield could be obtained from both assets, with very few periods of divergence. This is another data-point suggesting traders are taking advantage of any and all yield available in the market, wherever liquidity and trade volume allow it.\n\nAt present, the 3M rolling basis yield is around 3.1% for both assets, which is historically very low. However, this is now higher than the US 10yr Treasury yield of 2.78%, which may start giving capital a reason to re-enter the space.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThat said, options markets continue to price in near-term uncertainty, and downside risk, especially over the next three to six months. Implied volatility experienced a significant increase last week during the market sell-off. Short-dated at-the-money options saw IV more than double, from 50% to 110%, whilst 6-month dated option IV jumped to 75%. This is a break higher from what has been a long period of very low implied IV levels.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWith such a heavy bear market in play, and with such poor price performance, it is no surprise that the market has a notable preference for Put options. The Put/Call Ratio for open interest has increased from 50% to 70% over the last two weeks, as the market seeks to hedge further downside risk.\n\nLive Chart\n\nLooking out to the end of Q2, we can see a heavy preference for Put options, with key strike prices of $25k, $20k, and $15k. The pool of open Call options is significantly lower, with open interest mostly concentrating around the $40k strike price.\n\nThis suggests that at least out to the middle of the year, the market has a strong preference for hedging risk, and/or speculating on further downside price action.\n\nLive Chart\n\nHowever on a longer-term basis, options open interest at the end of the year is notably more constructive. There is a clear preference for call options, with concentration around strike prices of $70k to $100k. Furthermore, the dominant put option strike prices are at $25k and $30k, which are at higher price levels than the mid-year.\n\nThus, based on the spread of options open interest, it appears that the market is quite uncertain about the immediate term (2-3months) in particular. Speculators do however seem to be taking advantage of lower implied volatility, and taking on a more constructive view out to years end.\n\nLive Chart\nOn-chain Ghost-towns\n\nPerhaps in strong confluence with the near term fear expressed in derivatives markets, the on-chain activity of both Bitcoin and Ethereum remains unimpressive. Ultimately, high demand for blockspace and utilisation of a network generally manifests as network congestion, and transaction fees spiking. Whilst Bitcoin did see a 2x bump in total fees paid last week during the volatility, it has been languishing around 10-12BTC per day since May 2021.\n\nNote, we covered more of the nuance leading to a low Bitcoin on-chain fee regime in Week 15, although a lack of demand for blockspace remains a primary driver.\n\nLive Chart\n\nDespite having a fairly lively blockchain ecosystem, Ethereum too has seen blockspace demand dry up significantly. Whilst the network sports a great many applications, financial protocols, and tokens, mean gas prices on Ethereum have still fallen, now at just 26.2 Gwei.\n\nWith the exception of a few spikes during high profile NFT mints, and the sell-off last week, Ethereum gas prices have been in a structural downtrend since December. Mean gas prices this low are at levels coincident with the May-July 2021 lows, and the post March 2020 uncertainty period.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA knock on effect of lower demand for Ethereum blockspace is a net reduction in the number of ETH coins burned via the EIP1559 protocol implementation. After hitting an ATH of 38,940 ETH/day burned during the Bored Ape Yacht Club 'Otherside' NFT mint, the burn rate is now at an all-time-low.\n\nThis week, 2,370 ETH were burned, which is a 50% reduction compared to the start of May, and represents a burn rate of 18.4% of the minted supply (i.e. 81.6% of minted ETH is entering circulation). Whilst burning 18.4% is more than 0%, it is possible additional coins entering the supply, during weakened incoming demand can be a headwind for prices.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nTo close out on the relative demand for Ethereum blockspace, we can review the on-chain activity associated with popular DeFi tokens; AAVE, COMP, UNI and YFI. The charts below shows the number of active addresses interacting with these tokens, and the USD denominated volume transferred in each. These are relatively simple metrics and comparisons, however the relationships to price performance are quite apparent.\n\nWhat we see is a strong correlation between on-chain activity and DeFi token price performance, and at present both remain fairly uninspiring across the board. There was a slight uptick in activity last week, but it remains to be seen if this is a reversal of trend, or a flash in the pan.\n\nLive Dashboard\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nBear markets can take their toll, and this particular bear has done just that. Until the market approaches some form of sustained bottom, bears usually get worse before they get better. What we have observed in the sections above is a relatively cohesive story of poor price performance, diminishing long-term returns, fear being priced into near-term derivative markets, and a side of lacklustre on-chain activity.\n\nThis effect is relatively universal across the digital asset market, with both Bitcoin and Ethereum seeing dramatically lower utilisation and demand relative to the bull market. For DeFi tokens, even more so. There are signals that internal capital rotation is towards BTC at this time, perhaps punctuated by the LUNA and UST collapse last week. Such a rotation is a historical characteristic of bear markets, as investors move towards perceived safer assets.\n\nWith that said, the last 12-months of price performance of the industry relative to the US Dollar remains unfortunate, and this bear has made a non-trivial dent in long-term return profiles.\n\nNevertheless, bear markets do have a way of ending, perhaps just not right now. As the saying goes however, 'bear markets author the bull that follows'.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nAdded shift function to workbench.\nReleased Whale Activity Metrics; Volume To Exchanges, Volume From Exchanges, Transfers To Exchanges, Transfers From Exchanges\nUncharted Newsletter Edition #15 released.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\n\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nUnstable Coins\n\nThe Bitcoin market experienced a week for the history books, with the $40B LUNA/UST project hyper-inflating and collapsing, 80k BTC sold by LFG, the Tether $1 peg coming under pressure, Stablecoin supplies contracting by $7.5B, and a near visit to the Realized Price\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nMay 16, 2022 • 12 min read\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets experienced a week of historic volatility and chaos, with the exchange rate for two stablecoins, UST and USDT taking centre stage. Over the course of just a few days, two top 10 digital assets by market cap (LUNA and UST) erased nearly $40 Billion in investor value. UST lost its $1 peg completely, and LUNA collapsed to a price of $0.00001 as its supply hyper-inflated. As a result, the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) deployed their only recently established reserves of 80,394 BTC to defend the peg, although without success.\n\nLater in the week, and on the momentum of UST de-pegging news, the market temporarily expressed fear over the quality of Tether's peg (USDT). USDT traded briefly down to a low of $0.9565, however recovered within 24hrs, currently trading at a very slight discount of $0.998.\n\nAmidst the stablecoin contagion, and under the weight of $3.275 Billion worth of Bitcoin sold by the LFG, Bitcoin traded down 21.2% to $26,513. This is the lowest price since December 2020 and naturally puts much of the market under financial stress.\n\nIn this weeks newsletter we will cover these three key topics, namely:\n\nThe UST and LUNA market dynamics, what happened to LUNA and UST supplies, and how the LFG Bitcoin reserves were deployed.\nThe brief de-pegging of USDT, and how it affected the market perception of other stablecoins such as USDC, BUSD and DAI.\nBitcoin prices traded down towards the Realized Price, which is historically a significant support level, and the markets observable reaction to this event.\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, Farsi, Polish, and Greek.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further on our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nThe Spectacular and Reflexive Fall of LUNA\n\nOver the past few years, the market has seen stablecoins rise to represent a sizeable portion of the total market cap of all digital assets. On the 8-May, stablecoins captured more than $135 Billion in value between USDT, USDC, BUSD, DAI, and UST.\n\nStablecoins come in a number of flavours, but can generally be represented in three types:\n\nCollatoralised (USDT, USDC, BUSD)\nCrypto-over-collateralised (DAI)\nAlgorithmic (UST).\n\nIn the case of UST and LUNA, the algorithmic design allowed for users to convert 1 UST into $1 worth of LUNA (and vice-versa), irrespective of the market price of both assets. In effect, this means that the LUNA supply contracts (and price often rises) when there is demand for UST. However, this same reflexivity works in reverse, when demand falls, and prices move to the downside, the supply of LUNA can (and did) hyper-inflate.\n\nThe UST peg began to break in the 9-May, where LUNA was trading around $60 (~49.5% off the $119 ATH). Over the next 36-hours, LUNA prices fell below $0.1, and the UST peg traded between extremes of $0.30 and $0.82. This put the protocol redemption mechanism into overdrive, as users both panicked, and arbitraged the exchange of 1 UST for $1 worth of LUNA, inflating the supply and depressing prices further.\n\nAt the time of writing, LUNA is now trading for $0.0002 (down 99.9998% from ATH), and UST is stabilising around $0.1251, well below the desired $1 peg.\n\nThe magnitude of LUNA supply inflation can be seen the chart below, where UST supply (green, RHS) is in linear scale, whilst LUNA supply (red, LHS) is in log scale. Over the course of one week, 7.5 Billion UST were redeemed (40% of supply), whilst the LUNA supply inflated from 343 Million, to over 6.53 Trillion, an annualised inflation rate of 99,263,840%.\n\nAt one stage on 13-May, the LUNA blockchain was even halted as a result of second order effects on network stability and governance due to the hyper-inflating supply.\n\nThe Terra blockchain has officially halted at block 7607789.\n\nTerra Validators have halted the network to come up with a plan to reconstitute it.\n\nMore updates to come.\n\n— Terra (UST) 🌍 Powered by LUNA 🌕 (@terra_money) May 13, 2022\n\nAs the UST peg traded lower, the Luna Foundation Guard began to deploy their recently acquired Bitcoin reserves in an effort to stabilise the peg. Their total reserves had built up to 80,394 BTC over recent months, with the largest acquisitions occurring between 21 March and 5 May. The total realized value of their holdings, with coins valued at the time they were added to the wallet, was $3.275 Billion.\n\nThese wallets were completely emptied over a 21.5 hour window between the 9th and 10th of May.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThe LFG Bitcoin balance was emptied in three tranches as shown below. The first tranche deployed around $750M in value (22,189 BTC) at 3:30 on 9-May as the UST peg traded down to $0.98. The second tranche of 30,000 BTC ($916M) was deployed 15-hours later, and the final tranche of 28,205 BTC ($873M) was emptied from the wallet 6.5hrs later.\n\nA series of equivalently sized exchange inflows (shown in blue) occurred between 18:30 on 9-May and 01:10 on 10-May as coins were moved between custodians by the market makers engaged by LFG. By our assessment, the initial destination of these coins were:\n\n52,189 BTC sent to to Gemini via OTC desks (which were quickly deployed elsewhere, including to Binance)\n28,205 BTC sent to Binance via direct transfer\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThe LFG has since confirmed that almost all of the Bitcoin was sold, and as of 16-May, they have just 313 BTC remaining in inventory.\n\n8/ As of now, the Foundation’s remaining reserves consist of the following assets:\n· 313 $BTC\n· 39,914 $BNB\n· 1,973,554 $AVAX\n· 1,847,079,725 $UST\n· 222,713,007 $LUNA (of which 221,021,746 is currently staked with validators)\n\n— LFG | Luna Foundation Guard (@LFG_org) May 16, 2022\n\nAggregate exchange balances increased by around 88k BTC over this period, which is higher than the 80,394 deployed by the LFG. This signals that these events triggered a contagion effect and panic, as Bitcoin investors added to the sell-side pressure. A large outflow occurred from Coinbase on 14-May, although it does not appear that Coinbase was a recipient venue of LFG sourced coins.\n\nLive Chart\nUnstable Coin Contagion\n\nAs if the week had not already experienced enough chaos, on 11-May, Tether (USDT) which is the largest stablecoin by market cap saw its peg come under pressure. Whilst UST was significant in size ($21B), many consider USDT at $83B in size to be systemically important to the market in its current form, being the dominant quote pair on many exchanges.\n\nOver the period from midday 11-May to midday 12-May, USDT traded below its $1 peg to a low of $0.9565, before recovering within 36hrs to trade at a slight discount of $0.998. During this time, other major stablecoins USDC, BUSD and DAI experienced at a 1% to 2% premium as investors moved towards assets they perceived were less at risk of contagion.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nTether announced on 12-May during the worst of the peg stress that redemptions remained open and active, and that $2B worth were already underway.\n\nTether Continues to Honour All Redemptions from Verified Customers During Market Volatility, On Track To Process 2bn Today https://t.co/p1AugHb9Gn\n\n— Tether (@Tether_to) May 12, 2022\n\nIf we look to the supply of USDT, we can see that indeed, over $7.485 Billion worth of USDT has been redeemed with week. The total USDT supply declined from near the $81.237B ATH to $75.75B. As we noted in last weeks report, the recent stablecoin supply contraction of $2.9B was the largest in history, mostly driven by USDC. As such, an outflow of this scale has now put this week into the pole position by this metric.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe also saw interesting supply changes across the other major stablecoin supplies this week, providing insight on market preference during times of stress. USDC reversed the trend of supply contraction that has been in place since late Feb, expanding by $2.639B. Given the dominant growth of USDC over the last 2yrs, this may be an indicator of changing market preference away from USDT and towards USDC as the preferred stablecoin.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe other stablecoin that saw a dramatic change in supply was DAI, which saw supply fall by 24.4%, as $2.067 Billion was burned. DAI is an over-collateralised stablecoin, backed by other digital assets deposited in the Maker protocol. The DAI supply will contract when debt holders close out their position by repaying and burning DAI.\n\nThis process can be discretionary, or forced in the event of a vault liquidation. However, despite the high volatility in collateral assets, elevated demand for DAI, and liquidation events, DAI managed to maintain a strong $1 peg, albeit trading at a very slight premium.\n\nLive Chart\nHeavy Losses Realized On-chain\n\nAs the LUNA saga unfolded, the coins acquired by LFG were spent on-chain at prices much lower than when they were purchased. With the USDT peg also coming under pressure, prices broke below the $29k support level set in July 2021. This actually put all investors from the 2021-22 cycle into a loss, and precipitated a significant and widespread net loss.\n\nNet losses realized by all on-chain spending hit over $2.5Billion for two consecutive days, which is on par with the largest capitulation events in history (the largest if considered in aggregate).\n\nLFG alone contributed a realized loss of $703.7M to the total aggregate. Note, this reflects losses between when the coins entered, and left the LFG wallet, and does not account for the additional losses that were taken as the BTC was traded for UST and hyper-inflating LUNA.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs the Bitcoin market grows in size, naturally the USD denominated losses can and will be larger over time. Thus, we can establish a 'relative realized loss' metric by dividing daily realized loss across the network by the Realized Cap to compare apples between cycles.\n\nHere we can see that the LUNA capitulation still precipitated one of the largest loss events in the last 5 years, triggering aggregate losses equivalent to 0.28% of the Realized cap. This is comparable to:\n\nThe start and end sell-off events of the 2018 bear market\nThe March 2020 COVID crash\nThe May 2021 sell-off, which interestingly is celebrating its 1yr anniversary this week.\nLive Workbench Chart\nRealized Price Within Reach\n\nThe Realized Price is one of the oldest, and most fundamental metric concepts in on-chain analysis. It is calculated by dividing the Realized Cap, which is the sum of all coin values at the time when they were last moved, by the circulating supply. Thus it reflects an estimate of the aggregate cost basis of all coins in the supply.\n\nHistorically, the Realized Price has provided sound support during bear markets, and has provided signals of market bottom formation when the market price trades below it. The table below shows the previous bear market cycles, and the proportion of time where prices traded below the realized price.\n\nIt can be seen that over time, each bear cycle has spent less relative duration below the realized price. This may be in part a result of general market awareness of its existence (it was first discovered in 2018). March 2020 remains the most notable deviation, with just 7-days spent below the realized price, rather than months as seen in prior cycles.\n\nAs the market hit the weekly price low of $26,513, the Realized Price was trading at $24k. As the market collapsed under the weight of LFGs BTC sales, the destruction of value held in LUNA and UST, and the depeg fear of Tether, spot prices fell within 9.5% of the Realized Price.\n\nAs a result of the aggregate realized losses described above, the Realized Cap declined by $7.92 Billion, representing a capital outflow from the Bitcoin network, and causing the Realized Price to decline by $60 to $23,940.\n\nLive Chart\n\nDespite the volatility however, the bulls in the market appeared to responded strongly as prices fell towards a the Realized Price. The chart and table below show the Accumulation Trend Score, which will return values closer to 1 when a large proportion of the market are adding to their on-chain balances.\n\nOn Thursday 12-May, when the market was at the lowest, the Accumulation Trend Score reversed from very weak values below 0.3, to return values upwards of 0.796. Supporting the Bitcoin price bounce back into the $30ks, the Score returned values above 0.9 for the remainder of the week, suggesting strong buy side activity took place.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis can be further confirmed looking at the various wallet cohorts that participated. What we can see is a swift reversal from weak accumulation (< 0.3, warm colours) across all cohorts in early May, to strong accumulation across most cohorts this week (> 0.7, cool colours).\n\nSmall holders (< 1BTC) were by far the largest accumulators, and were supported by whales with more than 10k BTC (which includes the LFG balance which was completely distributive). Wallet cohorts holding 100 BTC to 10k BTC remained weaker in their net accumulation.\n\nThe takeaway observation is that whilst exchange balances ticked higher, realized losses were taken at a historical scale, and LFG unloaded 80k BTC, the aggregate market still added to their balance. This offset distribution impacts that will have weighed heavily on the Accumulation Trend Score over the last week.\n\nUnreleased metric from the Glassnode Engine Room\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWhat happened this week was historic in nature, however in many ways, aligns with the characteristics of a textbook digital asset bear market. There have been various examples of large name cryptocurrency projects that turned out to be unstable, and ultimately collapse under their own weight. Such events are usually precipitated by the downwards price pressure of a bear market, as demand wanes, and experimental systems (which are often leveraged) come under stress.\n\nAs stablecoins become increasingly integrated as base layer infrastructure in the market, the shockwaves of a de-pegging event, especially in the largest stablecoin USDT will have widespread impacts. The double momentum from UST and USDT depegging, some $40B in LUNA/UST value destroyed, and with LFG adding 80k BTC sell-pressure created a perfect storm. This event will also no doubt attract the regulatory spotlight at a greater pace and urgency.\n\nIt remains to be seen if a full return to the Realized Price is required to put this bear market to rest, and if so whether it is for months, weeks, days or just a short a moment. Perhaps those days are behind us if the accumulation we observed is indicative of the support the bulls are willing to put up in the $20ks range. Note also, there remains a plethora of macro, inflationary and monetary policy forces acting as headwinds. The road ahead will likely continue to be a rocky one.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReleased Whale Activity Metrics; Volume To Exchanges, Volume From Exchanges, Transfers To Exchanges, Transfers From Exchanges\nReleased Entity-adjusted URPD\nUncharted Newsletter Edition #15 released.\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Weakness has appeared across ETF product flows, stablecoin supply contraction, and in investor urgency to deposit coins to exchanges, largely in response to downside volatility.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nMay 9, 2022 • 10 min read\n\nMarkets experienced high volatility and further downside this week, as the market responded to the Federal Reserve's decision to hike rates by 0.5%. Markets initially responded well to the news on Wednesday, with Bitcoin rallying to the weekly high of $39,881. However, the positive momentum was short-lived, with markets selling off heavily on Thursday, and Bitcoin trading down -13.8% to close the week at $33,890.\n\nIn this edition, we will first assess the state of network profitability, and how it has changed relative to the 'bear market pain threshold' case study we proposed last week.

The Bitcoin market is now -49.5% below the November all-time-high.\n\nWhilst this represents a significant drawdown, it remains modest when compared to the ultimate lows of prior Bitcoin bear markets. July 2021 reached a drawdown of -54.2%, and the bear markets of 2015, 2018 and March 2020 capitulated at lows between -77.2% and -85.5% off the ATH.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn last weeks edition, we established a potential case study for a further decline of 10% in overall network profitability (defined as a drop in the percent of addresses, entities and/or supply in profit). In that case study, we estimated that prices would need to fall to around $33.6k to reach a similar 'pain threshold' to previous bear markets, and drop overall profitability to around 60% of the network.\n\nAs prices hit $33.8k week, we have now seen this scenario largely play out, and an additional 10% of the Bitcoin network did indeed fall into an unrealized loss. All three metrics declined from ~72% to between 60% and 62% in profit. These levels are coincident with profitability seen in the late-2018, and late 2019-20 bear markets. However it should be noted that both instances were prior to the final capitulation flush out event.\n\nAs such, further downside remains a risk, and would be within the realm of historical cycle performance.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nGiven these three metrics tend to move in tandem, we can calculate a simple change in the average network profitability over the 30-days. This provides us with an indication of the rate of change in 'financial stress' for Bitcoin investors. Over the last month, the percent of the Bitcoin network that has fallen into an unrealized loss is 15.5% on average.\n\nThis decline in profitability is the fourth most severe over the last 3-years. This is compared with July, and December 2021, which both saw profitability declines of -18.1% to -19.1%. March 2020 remains the the most significant in recent history, with -35.4% of the Bitcoin network falling into the red over just a few days.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nThe On-chain Reaction\n\nBitcoin markets have become increasingly dynamic over the recent years, with a holistic analysis now requiring a view of on-chain coin movements, exchange related volumes, off-chain investment vehicles (e.g. ETFs, ETPs), derivatives markets, and stablecoins. With this in mind, we will now assess the market reaction across these various venues.\n\nThe Bitcoin accumulation trend score indicator has seen a notably softer month, returning values less than 0.2 since mid-April. This generally signals more distributive behaviour, and less accumulation has been in play, and is coincident with weaker market prices.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can further dissect this into wallet cohorts, where we see that across the board, most wallet cohorts from shrimp to whales, have greatly softened in their onchain accumulation trends. Very large entities with balances > 10k have been a particularly significant distributive force over the last few weeks, as can be seen by the large red values returned. Smaller investors (< 1BTC) are the strongest accumulators, however their accumulation is notably weaker than it was in February and March.\n\nUnreleased metric from the Glassnode Engine Room\n\nDuring times of volatility and market stress, it is typical to see an influx of 'urgent' transactions enter the Bitcoin mempool, as investors seek to de-risk, sell, or re-collateralise their margin positions. As the market sold off this week, we did see an burst of 42.8k transactions enter the Bitcoin mempool. This is the highest influx in transaction activity since mid-October 2021 (when we started tracking mempool activity).\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also see that there was a high degree of urgency associated with these transactions, as the total value of all on-chain transaction fees paid reached 3.07 BTC. This is higher than was seen during the 4-December deleveraging event, at which time the market dropped -34.5% in one day (covered in Week 49, 2021), and is again the largest value in our data-set to date.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe dominance of on-chain transaction fees associated with exchange deposits also signalled urgency, reaching the second highest value in history. This further supports the case that Bitcoin investors were seeking to de-risk, sell and/or add collateral to margin in response to market volatility.\n\n15.2% of all on-chain transaction fees paid were associated with exchange deposit transactions, which is higher than the at the apex of the 2017 bull-run (12.1%), and surpassed only by the May 2021 sell-off (16.8%).\n\nLive Chart\n\nOn any given day, large volumes of BTC flow both into, and out of exchanges. Exchange flows of well over $750M (in both directions, $1.5B+ total) have been a typical lower bound for the 2021-22 market cycle.\n\nDuring the sell-off this week, over $3.15B in value passed in or out of exchanges, with a net bias towards inflows, which accounted for $1.60B (50.8%). This is the largest aggregate exchange related volume peak since the market was made all-time-highs in Oct-Nov last year. It is also equivalent to the inflow/outflow levels at the 2017 bull market peak.\n\nThe scale of recent history, when compared to last cycle, demonstrates just how much larger typical USD denominated capital flows are across the Bitcoin network.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nAssessing the Off-chain Response\n\nAs noted above, the Bitcoin market has become increasingly dynamic, requiring a view of both on-chain and off-chain dynamics to establish likely drivers of price movements, market momentum, and investor sentiment.\n\nOver the last two years, numerous spot ETF products have come to market, with three of these investment vehicles trading on Canadian exchanges. Whilst inflows to these products have generally been strong since November, the last two weeks have seen this trend reverse significantly.\n\nOn a 7-day change basis, over 6.66k BTC has flowed out of these instruments per week, which has largely corresponded with recent weakness in price.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nIn the derivatives space, Futures Open Interest has been relatively quiet given the magnitude of volatility this week. In the days leading up to the Federal Reserve announcement of rate hikes, approximately $1B in open interest entered Bitcoin futures markets.\n\nHowever, much of this leverage was quickly closed out, and total open interest actually stabilised after the sell-off on Thursday, holding at around $14.3B.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can see the initial whipsaw action leading up to the Federal Reserve announcement in the 1-day change of futures open interest. Open interest increased by a total of 30.4k BTC on 3-May, before 25.48k BTC in value was closed out the following day.\n\nWhilst these values are non-trivial in size, they remain relatively small in comparison to the major deleveraging events over the last 12-months. As such, it appears less likely that excessive futures leverage was a core driver of price action this week.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can add further confidence to this assessment by looking at the total liquidations occurring in futures markets. Generally speaking, during a futures market deleveraging event, we expect a large relative volume of positions being forced closed via liquidations.\n\nHowever this week, at the peak of the sell-off, a maximum value of $135M in futures positions were liquidated. This represents less than 0.2% of traded futures volume. As expected, long positions took the brunt of the damage, with a 61.5% dominance of all positions liquidated. Overall, it seems that much of the recent weakness in price action is driven more by poor investor sentiment, capital outflows, and de-risking, rather than a futures driven de-leveraging.\n\nLive Chart\n\nLastly, to establish a gauge on capital flows into the market, we can look to the stablecoin market. Stablecoins have been one of the primary areas of explosive growth in the industry over the last few years, and represent a primary vehicle for capital inflow and outflow.\n\nSince the March 2020 sell-off, the aggregate supplies of the major stablecoins (USDT, USDC, BUSD and DAI) has increased from $5.33B, to over $158.25B. This is an astonishing growth of 2,866% in just over two years. USDT remains the dominant asset, accounting for 52.6% of the major supplies, and is followed by USDC at 30.8% dominance.\n\nHowever since the start of April, the aggregate stablecoin supply has plateaued, and now contracted by $3.285B. This is coming off an ATH supply of $161.53B. The majority of stablecoin redemption are being driven by USDC which has declined by $4.77B since the start of March. USDT on the other hand has seen its supply continue to expand, increasing by $2.50B over the same period.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThe chart below shows the 30-day change in aggregate stablecoin supply (blue) alongside the contribution by USDC (red).\n\nIt can be seen that particularly since May 2021, USDC has been a major contributor to total stablecoin supply growth. We can also see that this recent stablecoin supply contraction is a rare event, with the total supply contraction hitting a rate of -$2.9B per month. USDC is the primary stablecoin asset that is experiencing redemption, and this signals a degree of net capital outflow is occurring from the cryptocurrency industry at large.\n\nOverall, there are a number of signals of net weakness in the space, many of which indicate that risk-off sentiment remains the core market position at this time.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nAs the Bitcoin market matures, and more institutional capital enters the space, it has become increasingly apparent that the market responds to macroeconomic shocks, and tighter monetary conditions. Wider markets responded in a volatile manner to the Federal Reserve announcement of further rate hikes, which whilst expected, does confirm increasingly tight liquidity across markets.\n\nThis week we sought to take a holistic view of the market, assessing the response both on- and off-chain. There appears to be aggregate weakness across almost all sectors, however it does appear to be primarily driven by poor investor sentiment, and a risk-off mentality, rather than a derivatives led deleveraging. Furthermore, a significant contraction in stablecoin supplies, particularly USDC, suggests capital a net outflow from the space is underway. This supports our recent observation of net capital outflows from derivatives markets as available yields compress towards 2% to 3%.\n\nBitcoin remains highly correlated to the broader economic conditions, which suggests the road ahead may unfortunately be a rocky one, at least for the time being.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReleased Options 25 Delta Skew Suite\nReleased Entity-adjusted URPD\nAdded crypto.com to the list of supported exchanges\nFeature Release: Workbench Charts are now available in Dashboards, and all Dashboards now support full data history.\nUncharted Newsletter Edition #14 released.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nPeering Into the Abyss\n\nBitcoin investors are hanging onto the edge of profitability, with short-term price action threatening to put them back into the red. Meanwhile, a constructive confluence of macro indicators are developing into a clearer picture of a potential bear market floor.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nMay 2, 2022 • 10 min read\n\nMarkets worldwide continue to recoil in the face of inflationary pressures, tightening monetary conditions, and compounding uncertainties and risks. This week saw significant weakness across equities, bonds, and cryptocurrency markets, with Bitcoin trading down to a new monthly low of $37,614.\n\nDespite trading down this week, Bitcoin markets have actually remained surprisingly robust, on a relative basis. Whilst the S&P500 and NASDAQ indexes traded to new local lows of the prevailing bearish trend, Bitcoin prices remain range-bound, and continue to lack any definitive macro momentum in either direction. With that said, correlations between Bitcoin and traditional markets remain near all-time-highs, and a broader perception of Bitcoin as a risk asset remains a significant headwind.\n\nA very large proportion of Bitcoin investors are peering into the abyss of holding unprofitable positions, creating the potential tinder for a much discussed capitulation event. Simultaneously however, numerous long term macro indicators are signalling historical undervaluation levels are in play, reaching values rarely seen outside late stage bear market floors. In this edition, we will explore this notable divergence between the drivers of bearish short-term price action, and the medium-to-long term fundamental trends for Bitcoin.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, and Farsi.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further n our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nLooking Over The Edge of Profitability\n\nOver recent weeks, we have explored how a significant proportion of the BTC supply has been redistributed and sold to new owners entering in the $33k and $42k price range. However, with global markets continuing to slip lower, the risk that these new investors will also fall into an unrealized loss is growing.\n\nAt present, the proportion of both Addresses, Entities, and Supply held in profit is hovering around 70% (meaning 30% are held at a loss). Previous bear market lows set in 2018-19, and March 2020 saw far more severe declines in market profitability, with between 45% and 57% of the market in profit.\n\nFrom this, we can establish a case study to analyse further; what would happen should an additional 10% of the market fell into an unrealised loss (the result being 60% of the market is in profit)? This provides us with an example gauge on the price that the market would need to hit before a similar 'pain threshold' is reached to past cycle lows. This '60% in profit threshold' also accounts for the observable uptrend in these floor values over time (an artefact of lost coins, HODLers from past cycles etc).\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThe URPD metric provides us a view on which prices the current Bitcoin supply was last moved at.\n\nWith prices trading at $38.5k at the time of writing, the market would need to fall to $33.6k in order to plunge an additional 1.9M BTC into an unrealized loss (10% of supply). This would reach our example 'pain threshold' of 60% supply in profit and put almost all buyers from the last 16-month cycle into the red (with buyers of the May-July 2021 lows being the only exceptions).\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe cohort that is most at risk of selling in a panic are the Short-Term Holders (STHs), a cohort that we identified (in Week 16) have accumulated an extraordinary volume of coins over the last three months. If we look to the STH-MVRV Ratio (Z-Score), we can observe the magnitude of their current unrealized profitability.\n\nIn the chart below, we can see the following:\n\nThe on-chain cost basis of STHs is at $46,910, putting the average coin held by a STH at an unrealized loss of -17.9%.\nThe STH-MVRV oscillator is currently at -0.75 standard deviations from the mean, which shows that the this is a statistically significant magnitude of financial pain for the STH cohort.\nMore severe profitability for STHs is not uncommon, but is typical only during the worst sell-offs in bear markets (where oscillator is below the below blue line).\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nOn the other side of the equation are the Long-Term Holders (LTHs), whom we also established were capitulating at the greatest extent in history. This trend appears to continue with an incredible deviation developing between two metrics taking place, identified first by TXMC:\n\nLong-Term Holder Reazlied Price (blue): This metric shows the average purchase price of all coins in the LTH cohort, and it is currently declining at the most significant rate in Bitcoin history. This indicates that LTHs from the 2021-22 cycle are capitulating, spending, and redistributing their coins, specifically during the last 3 months.\nLong-Term Holder Spent Price (pink): This metric shows the average purchase price of coins being spent by LTHs that day. It is breaking notably higher this week, meeting with the spot price, and signalling that LTHs are panic selling at break-even on average.\n\nBoth of these metrics add significant substance to the argument that the newest entrants to the LTH cohort from 2021-22 are capitulating, and fearful of further downside.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nCharacterizing Long-Term Holder Spending\n\nWe can further characterize these LTH spenders, and narrow in the typical age range of their coins using a variety of on-chain tools. First we will review a new metric that is under construction in the Glassnode engine room that presents two traces:\n\nOscillator (grey, 30DMA) showing the proportion of BTC volume sent to exchanges by Long-Term Holders that is in profit. We can see it has declined significantly since September 2021, and is now hovering around 60% (adding weight to our previous pain threshold estimate).\nPrice chart coloured by raw profitability relative to the last year, with red signalling high relative losses, and green/blue signalling heavy relative profits. The bear markets of 2014-15, 2018-19, and 2021-22 become quite apparent, with heavy LTH losses realized for many months.\n\nThe only LTHs whom could realize losses and trigger this result are those from the 2021-22 cycle with a higher cost basis, suggesting they dominate LTH spending behaviour into exchange at present.\n\nUnreleased metric from the Glassnode Engine Room\n\nNext we look at Revived Supply 1yr+ which captures all BTC on-chain volume that was purchased prior to the mid-May 2021 sell-off. What we can see is that this metric is actually declining and is near relative lows. Usually very low readings of revived supply occur in deep bear markets where accumulation is the preferred behaviour of LTHs.\n\nLive Chart\n\nBinary Coin-days Destroyed largely corroborates this observation, with a near identical trend and notable markers. On a 7-day average basis (at hourly resolution), this metric is indicating than 18.5 hours out of each week are seeing greater than average lifespan destruction. In other words, 89% of the time, owners of older coins are choosing to keep them dormant, and are not contributing to spending sell-side pressure.\n\nBoth of these metrics further supports the notion that LTH sell-side pressure at the moment is primarily driven by owners of coins between 155-days, and ~12-months (aka 2021-22 buyers).\n\nLive Chart\nFundamentals of a Bear Market Floor\n\nOn-chain tools can provide us with both an assessment of current investor behaviour (above), but also with fundamental valuation tools to help us map out and navigate various market cycles.\n\nThe chart below is a variant of Realized Profit (green) and Loss (pink), calculated by dividing each by the Realized Cap. This effectively normalises the USD value investors bring in/out of the market, to the relative market size, enabling us to compare cycles. From this we can broadly identify three market phases:\n\nBull Markets (green zone), where sufficient inflow of demand exists to allow investors to realize significant profits, right into the market cycle top (net capital inflows).\nBear Markets (red zone), where the converse is true, and declining prices result in a dominance of losses being realised by investors (net capital outflows). In 2019 and arguably late 2021, we saw profits taken into a brief bullish relief rally, that was ultimately sold into.\nDisbelief Recovery to Early Bull (orange zone), where the market trades sideways to upwards, typical of a re-accumulation period or disbelief phase, and realized profits start to exceed losses on a consistent basis.\n\nIn the current market, we remain within the Bear Market phase, where the market is yet to provide sufficient demand and price appreciation to enable sustainable profit taking and capital inflow. Should realized profits begin to outpace losses on a sustained basis, alongside stable prices, it may suggest a transition to Phase 3 is underway.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOne of the most well known Bitcoin indicators, and a crowd favourite, is the Mayer Multiple. This oscillator is calculated as a simple ratio between price and the 200DMA. Despite its simplicity, it has provided a robust and reliable long-term bottom and top formation indicator for Bitcoin cycles.\n\nHere, we have mapped out a Mayer Multiple of 0.8 (green trace) as a historical 'undervaluation' level. The basis for this is that less than ~15% of Bitcoins trading life has been at, or below this level, providing a more probabilistic view. With the 200DMA trading at $47,275, this 20% discount level is currently trading at $37,820.\n\nBear market floors of past cycles are typically hammered out in two phases relative to the 0.8xMM level, first in the early stage of the bear (#1), and then again following a major capitulation event (#2). The market is currently hovering just above this key level in what could be argued to be a part of the 2021-22 cycle Phase #2.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Reserve Risk metric provides another macro view on bear market bottoms, and is an oscillator that is heavily weighed down by when accumulation and HODLing is preferred (see our video guide). Historically, Reserve Risk has dipped below the 0.0025 threshold (green) in late stage bear markets (pre-bottom formation), and resurfaced part way through the subsequent bull market.\n\nThis indicator suggests that we have passed the initial late-bear-market entry point and could be well into the second half. However, based on prior cycles, it also suggests that the road ahead may still have some time, and/or downside to go.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn support of the notion that longer-term HODLers remain unfazed, the Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple is oscillating around relative lows. This indicates that the value and magnitude of coin-days destroyed right now is small relative to the last year. This provides confluence to the Binary CDD, 1yr+ Revived supply, and Reserve Risk metrics that the dominant behaviour by long-term investors (1yr+ holding) is HODLing.\n\nBy this metric, the bear market commenced around May 2021, and is approaching a similar duration to those seen in previous cycles.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFinally, we will assess the RVT Ratio, which divides the Realized Cap by the network transaction volume (both in USD, and with a 28DMA applied). This oscillator is a slow, but higher conviction variant of the NVT Ratio, and has the following properties:\n\nUptrends and High values are historically bearish, signalling that transaction volumes (and thus network utilisation) are declining relative to on-chain valuation (over-valued). Bear market bottoms are typically set at RVT values > 30, and confirmed by a reversal into a downtrend.\nDowntrends and Low values are historically bullish, conversely signalling that network utilisation is increasing relative to on-chain valuation (under-valued).\nSideways sustained trends signal a relative equilibrium, and typically suggest the prevailing market trend is sustainable.\n\nThis oscillator has now set a lower high relative to that in July 2021, and is reversing into a downtrend. Should this trend be maintained, it indicates that there is a potential influx of on-chain settlement volume, and growing network utilisation. This has historically been constructive for market prices.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe current market structure for Bitcoin remains in an extremely delicate equilibrium, with short-term price action and network profitability leaning bearish, whilst long-term trends remain constructive. The capitulation of Long-Term Holders appears to be continuing, with further evidence and analytical colour added to this concept this week.\n\nWhether macro forces and correlations with traditional markets drag Bitcoin lower remains to be seen, however numerous fundamental indicators at at or approaching noteworthy points of undervaluation. There is a constructive confluence across numerous macro indicators, ranging from technical analysis (Mayer Multiple), to coin lifespan analysis (Reserve Risk, VDD Multiple), and even fundamental network health and utilisation (RVT Ratio).\n\nA capitulation event, alongside developing divergences in short- and long-term trends continues to make Bitcoin one of the most fascinating assets to monitor within this macroeconomic environment.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReleased Options 25 Delta Skew Suite\nReleased Entity-adjusted URPD\nAdded crypto.com to the list of supported exchanges\nFeature Release: Workbench Charts are now available in Dashboards, and all Dashboards now support full data history.\nUncharted Newsletter Edition #14 released.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Growing Dominance of Perpetual Swaps\n\nYields, implied volatility and trading volume in Bitcoin derivatives markets continue to compress, leading to an aggregate decline in capital inflows. On-chain volumes also remain muted, however, more constructive medium to long term fundamental trends are starting to develop.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nApr 25, 2022 • 10 min read\n\nVolatility and trading volume continues to compress across the Bitcoin market, as prices remain bound within the $38k to $42k consolidation range. Market prices weakened slightly again this week, trading off a high of $42,893, and losing ground at a weekly low of $38,729.\n\nThe market has now traded within an increasingly tight price range for almost three months, leading to historically low yields available in futures markets cash-and-carry trades, alongside a persistent decline in trade volumes. Implied volatility priced into options markets has also broken below 60% this week, which is significantly lower than the 80%+ volatility that characterised much of 2021. Furthermore, transaction volumes on-chain remain muted, albeit with a growing trend of high value ($10M+) transactions, and a macro decline in volumes associated with exchange inflows and outflows.\n\nIn this edition, we will focus on a number of these big picture trends that are developing in Bitcoin markets, including:\n\nCompressing trade volumes, low implied options volatility, and rolling basis yields persistently below 3% in futures markets. All are leading to a leaking of capital out of Bitcoin markets as investors seek higher returns elsewhere.\nThe dominance of perpetual futures markets continues to grow, as these instruments have clearly become the preferred source of leverage.\nDeclining on-chain settlement volume, however with a growing dominance of large size transactions ($10M+).\nCyclical divergence between exchange related inflow/outflow volume, and total transaction volume. This accompanies a potential shift in momentum with respect to network utilisation, and provides a potentially constructive reversal in the fundamentally implied valuation for Bitcoin.\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, and Farsi.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further n our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nPerpetual Futures Dominance On The Rise\n\nOver the last five years or so, the market for Bitcoin derivatives has grown and matured in leaps and bounds. It has transitioned from a small fraction of spot trade volume in 2017, to now represent the dominant venue for price discovery. Futures trade volume now represents multiples of spot market volume.\n\nNevertheless, the aggregate futures trade volume has been in a macro decline since Jan 2021. During the first half of 2021, trade volumes between $70B and $80B per day were typical. In the current market however, futures trade volumes are down over 59%, currently around $30.7B/day. There was barely an uptick in Oct-Nov 2021, even as prices pushed to new all-time-highs.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOpen interest in futures markets is also notably lower than it was during peak bullish periods, currently hovering around $15 Billion, with a 2:1 split between perpetual futures, and calendar expiring futures. Current open interest is similar to levels seen in the May-Sept 2021 period, but remains 36.8% below the $22.5B+ peaks set in April, and again in November.\n\nLive Chart\n\nPerpetual futures are increasingly becoming the preferred instrument for trading, a trend that can be clearly visualised in the dominance chart below:\n\nBlue represents the dominance of perpetual swap trade volume compared to the total futures volume, showing a remarkable 92.4% dominance at present. This has increased from 75% dominance in Dec 2020 as the market broke through last cycles $20k ATH.\nPink represents the same dominance concept, but applied to futures open interest, which has risen from 50%, to over 66% dominance since Dec 2020.\n\nIn many ways, this trend is expected, and is likely a result of a few key factors:\n\nPerpetual swaps more closely match spot index pricing, thus making it easier and more intuitive for traders to manage positions and leverage.\nLow storage and delivery costs associated with digital assets negates many of the benefits of calendar futures when compared to physical commodities. Calendar futures provide useful tools for hedging risk, and pricing future production and delivery costs for physical commodities, however these costs approach zero for Bitcoin.\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThis trend also be seen in the Futures Leverage Ratio, which remains in a structural uptrend. This reflects a growing trend of the market deploying capital preferentially into perpetual swap markets, rather than calendar futures. The current open interest in perpetual swaps is equivalent to 1.3% of the Bitcoin market cap, which is approaching historically high levels.\n\nHowever it should be noted that the aggregate leverage ratio for all futures markets has actually declined over the last two weeks, falling from 2.1% in early April, to 1.9% today. As such, whilst perpetual swap open interest is relatively high, there is an even larger aggregate transfer of capital and leverage out of calendar expiring futures, creating a net decline in overall leverage.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nYield and Volatility Compression Continues\n\nA declining leverage ratio across all futures markets, despite increasing leverage in perpetual swaps, suggests that a reasonable volume of capital is actually leaving the Bitcoin market. This is further supported by the declining trade volumes shown above.\n\nIf we look at perpetual swap funding rates, we can see that the majority of 2022 has seen very low available yields, and little directional bias. This is a stark contrast to the hyper-bullish long speculation in H1-2021 and again from Aug-Nov, and periods of extreme bearishness in May-July 2021.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we annualize the perpetual funding rate, and compare it to the 3-month rolling basis available in calendar futures, we can see a likely reason behind why capital is rotating out of Bitcoin markets.\n\nYields available in futures markets have compressed to levels barely above 3.0%, which is hardly superior to the yield available from a 10y US treasury bond (2.9%), and significantly lower than the recent US CPI inflation print of 8.5%. It is likely that declining trade volumes and lower aggregate open interest is a symptom of capital flowing out of Bitcoin derivatives, and towards higher yield, and potentially lower perceived risk opportunities.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nWe can also see that options markets are pricing in historically low implied volatility, breaking below 60% over the past few weeks. There are very few instances in the last year where implied volatility has been this low, most of which are during the current consolidation range which has contained almost all of the year-to-date price action.\n\nWith low implied volatility in options markets, options short sellers are in a similar, low yield boat, as cash-and-carry futures traders.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also see a general shift in sentiment and risk management in the Put-to-Call ratios associated with both options trade volume (blue) and open interest (pink). Demand for call options dominated much of 2021, through til September, where bullish sentiment appears to wind down. As 2022 commenced, a distinct market preference emerged for put options, as more bearish sentiment took hold, and the demand for hedging downside risk increased.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nDivergence in On-chain Volumes\n\nTransitioning away from derivatives markets, we can see a similar trend of declining aggregate volume exists within on-chain settlement volumes. The Bitcoin network is currently settling between $5.5B and $7.0B in value per day, which is around 40% lower than the $9.5B to $11.0B/day seen at the bull market peaks.\n\nSettlement volumes do however remain notably higher than the ~$2.0B/day seen throughout 2019-20, suggesting a net increase in network utilisation has occurred.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe breakdown of transaction size also appears to have structurally changed, most notably after October 2020. The chart below shows the relative breakdown of transaction volume by USD value, and the explosion of dominance for $10M+ transaction size (dark green) is quite clear. Prior to October 2020, these large size transactions barely accounted for 10% of transfer volume on a big day, however now reflect a fairly consistent 40% dominance.\n\nNote that these charts utilise our entity-adjusted data, which filters out non-economic transactions such as exchange internal wallet management, and entity self-spends. It is likely that this sustained dominance of large transactions reflects a very real growth in value settlement by institutional sized investment/trading entities, custodians, and high net worth individuals.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTransfer volumes in and out of exchanges have always represented a significant share of overall transaction flows and are important to assess in context. The chart below shows the total entity-adjusted volume (blue), in comparison with exchange inflows (green) and outflows (red), all with a USD denomination.\n\nFirstly, we can see that inflows and outflows are often quite similar in scale, with traces generally overlying each other, at least visually at this scale. Total exchange flows currently represent around $2.1B per day, with a slight dominance towards outflows ($1.1B/day vs inflows of $1.0B/day).\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nWe can then take a ratio between total exchange flows (inflows + outflows), and total transfer volume, in an attempt to observe cyclical patterns associated with exchange transaction dominance.\n\nParticularly since 2016, on-chain volume associated with exchange inflows/outflows generally increases during more speculative and bullish periods, such as the 2016-17 bull run, and again from July-2019 to May-2021.\nConversely, during later stage bear markets, such as 2018-19, and since May 2021, the share of exchange related activity generally declines relative to aggregate value settlement.\n\nVolume in and out of exchanges currently represents between around 32% of all value settled, which is relatively low. This perhaps suggests there is a gradual transition away from pure speculation, and towards more fundamentally driven demand flows such as OTC transactions, HODLer accumulation, and custodial multi-signature setups etc.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nFinally, we can take these observations of aggregate transaction volumes, and model them as a fundamental pricing model, via a methodology first proposed by Willy Woo. The NVT price model takes the 2-year median of the NVT Ratio, and multiplies it by current transaction volume. The resulting model thus establishes an implied valuation based on the current utilisation levels of Bitcoin for value settlement.\n\nA 28-day (green) and 90-day (pink) period are used to establish a fast and slow signal respectively. These two models currently value Bitcoin between $32.5k (90-day) and $36.1k, with both starting to bottom out and potentially reverse. Of note is the recent positive momentum cross-over, with the faster 28-day breaking above the 90-day.\n\nHistorically, such cross-overs have been constructive medium to long term signals. However, as shown in blue below, these signals do require the confirmation of time to properly prove that positive momentum is in play. Greater value settlement on-chain would trigger both of these models to increase, implying stronger underlying fundamentals (and vice-versa is also true).\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nBitcoin derivatives markets have matured significantly over recent years, and the underlying structure of them continues to evolve. We have seen a distinct shift in the preferred instrument away from calendar expiring futures, and towards perpetual swap markets, which is expected given the ease of price interpretation, and low storage and delivery costs of digital assets.\n\nOver the course of the last 12-months, we have seen trade volumes, implied volatility, and available cash-and-carry yields compress to historical lows, which appears to be motivating some capital to leave the Bitcoin space in search of higher returns. With cash-and-carry yields persistently below 3.0%, and headline inflation running at 8.5%, this becomes increasingly probable.\n\nInterestingly, despite on-chain settlement volumes being similarly muted, there is a growing (but early) trend of strength developing in underlying fundamentals. Transactions larger than $10M have sustained ~40% dominance since late 2020, and the dominance of speculative exchange inflows and outflows, often associated with bull markets, appears to be in decline.\n\nImplied valuations of the NVT price model remain in the low to mid $30k region, which does indicate the bulls have their work cut out for them. However, these models are perhaps starting to bottom out and reverse, which is a trend worth keeping an eye on over the coming weeks.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nFeature Release: Workbench Charts are now available in Dashboards, and all Dashboards now support full data history.\nReleased Options 25 Delta Skew Suite\nBug Fix: Fixed bybit related futures perpetual metrics.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nShort-Term Pain, But Long-Term Gain?\n\nThe Bitcoin market has traded back below $40k, as weakness continues to pressure prices lower. However, under the surface, a deep, and widespread capitulation event appears to have been absorbed by persistent, robust and quiet demand.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nApr 19, 2022 • 10 min read\n\nBitcoin investors have weathered another weak week, with prices briefly trading back below $40k, completely retracing the March rally. Prices peaked at a high of $41,446 early in the week, before sliding to set a new local low of $38,729.\n\nThe Bitcoin market remains strongly correlated with traditional equity markets, which themselves have struggled to catch any serious or sustained bid, running up against numerous macro headwinds. The current broader market environment is one of rapid change, with a wide array of commodity markets breaking to new highs, bond yields trading strongly higher, and a seemingly ever worsening supply chain disruptions and headline inflation. As a relatively new, globally traded, and persistently active market, it is unsurprising that the Bitcoin price often reacts to a very wide scope of market forces.\n\nAbsorbing information across so many market segments is exceptionally challenging. However, if we consider Bitcoin to be an asset that appears to increasingly respond to broad market forces, then a study of its holding behaviour can provide a somewhat distilled view into the investment decisions and sentiment of other market participants.\n\nIn this edition we will deep dive into two important cohorts of Bitcoin holders, which we have defined based in their statistical likelihood of spending coins; the Long and Short-Term Holders. By analysing these two groups, we can identify holding patterns, capitulation potential, and whether risks and opportunities can be identified via the study of their aggregate behaviour.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, and Farsi.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further n our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nInvestor Value Zone\n\nIn the last few newsletter editions, we have explored how the $35k to $42k price zone for Bitcoin has seen fairly significant investor demand inflows, with a large number of coins changing hands in this price range. What we have yet to see is a follow on impulse of demand to break free of this range, and as a result, it continues to act as a source of gravity on the market.\n\nIn the first two charts, we will explore how the price distribution of coin supply has changed between the $33k low set on 22-Jan, and today.\n\nThe current price low of $33k was set on 22-Jan, putting a pause on the 2.5 month price decline from the ATH set in early November. On the 22-Jan, the range of prices at which the Bitcoin supply had last transacted was relatively well distributed between $35k and $63k (think of this as an on-chain volume profile in technical analysis).\n\nThis shows a relatively consistent demand was in place for BTC both on the way up (Aug-Nov) and on the way back down (Nov-Jan).\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we compare this (blue) to the current coin price distribution, we can identify the following insights:\n\nA large amount of coin supply has been re-accumulated between $38k and $45k, which is the primary price range of the current market consolidation.\nBlue: Much of the volume profile from 22-Jan remains intact. Despite an additional 2.5 months of sideways consolidation, a large proportion of the market appears unwilling to spend and sell their coins, even if their coins are held at a loss. This suggests price insensitive HODLers hold much of the supply > $40k.\nGreen: Coins that have been redistributed at a profit since the $33k low appear to come mainly from dip buyers ($32k and $36k), as well as a sizeable volume of ~60k BTC from the $3k to $4k price range.\nRed: pockets of redistribution at a loss have occurred as buyers who purchased after the Nov ATH realised that the dip was not over, and realised losses on the way down.\n\nThe overall takeaway observation is that the pattern of both profits and losses realised over the last 2.5 months suggest that investors continue to see the $35k to $42k range as a value zone for accumulation.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe define the threshold between Short and Long-Term Holders as 155-days, which at the time of writing, is positioned just after the Nov ATH. In simple terms:\n\nAlmost everyone who purchased after the ATH is a Short-Term Holder. This cohort is the most likely to spend their coins in reaction to market volatility.\nAlmost everyone who purchased before the ATH is a Long-Term Holder. This cohort are the least likely to spend their coins, preferring to accumulate in anticipation of the next macro bull market.\n\nThe chart below presents the current volume profile, however broken into LTH (blue) and STH (red) cohorts. We can draw the following conclusions:\n\nShort-Term Holders (red): Very few remain between $50k and $60k, suggesting most 'top buyers' have likely already capitulated. Conversely, a huge amount of new STH demand is clustered between $38k and $50k, affirming that investors continue to see value in this price range (new buyers).\nLong-Term Holders (blue): LTHs currently hold 15.2% of the coin supply at a loss, with coins held even at prices above $60k. These investors have weathered significant volatility, yet continue to hold. This supports the notion that these investors are a relatively price insensitive bunch, and remain the least likely to exert sell-side pressure.\nAn unreleased metric from the Glassnode Engine Room\nHistoric Growth in Unrealized Losses\n\nNow that we have profiled the various price ranges that investors hold their coins, we can dive deeper into the potential risk profile of additional sell-side pressure. The chart below presents the proportion of coins held by LTH (blue) and STH (red) that are at a loss.\n\nWe can see an approximately even split of 15.2% LTH : 15.0% STH, with a total of 30.2% of the coin supply held in loss.\n\nThe current market profitability is significantly better off than it was in the 2018 or 2020 bear markets. Back then, LTHs alone held more than 35% of the coin supply at loss. Furthermore, we can see a macro increase in coins held by the less price sensitive LTHs (black arrows). This is the result of accumulation and LTHs making value acquisitions, whilst also being willing to weather any price drawdowns that follow.\n\nWe can however see that compared to the May-July 2021 period, market profitability is in a worse position, with LTHs in particular holding significantly more supply at a loss compared to this period.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can construct an oscillator (Z-Score) for the rate of change for LTH coins held in loss. Here, we are attempting to see how quickly the profitability of the market is changing.\n\nIn simple terms:\n\nThis oscillator will be positive when lots of LTH coins are returning to profit. This will be the result of prices rallying, after heavy LTH accumulation.\nThis oscillator will be negative when lots of LTH coins fall into a loss. This will be the result of prices falling, and LTHs being caught by surprise by a correction.\n\nWhat we can see is that the recent correction pushed a historically significant volume of LTH coins into an unrealised loss. This means that the amount of buying between August and November, which has now become underwater HODLing, is some of the most significant of all time.\n\nLots of LTHs were caught off-side by this correction. Previous instances of such high readings have usually been in late stage bear markets, most of which preceded a final capitulation shake-out event.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nIf we shift our focus to the Short-Term Holders, we can see a similar pattern is in effect. The massive positive value reached in October is very similar to the 2019 rally, where a large proportion of the market returned to profitability in a relatively short timespan (A).\n\nWhat followed in both instances (B) was a long and painful drawdown that plunged all buyers who believed the bear market was over, back into an unrealized loss. Both the 2019, and current bear market trends are historically significant by this metric.\n\nThe takeaway from this study is that a historically large volume of investors who were active between August 2021, and January 2022 have seen the market price plunge below their cost basis, which has catalysed a large scale redistribution of the Bitcoin supply to new hands.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nHave We Capitulated Yet?\n\nThe notion of an investor capitulation is widely understood and talked about in markets, and they usually precipitate the end of a bear market trend. Capitulation events are typically characterised as a complete and total loss of confidence, large scale sell-pressure, and high volume, that effectively exhausts any and all remaining bears from the market.\n\nTo quickly recap so far, we have established:\n\nA great majority of investors who currently hold coins purchased above $40k are Long-Term Holders (pre-ATH), and have weathered significant volatility. This suggests they are price insensitive HODLers, and less likely to apply sell-side pressure.\nThe majority of Short-Term Holders who purchased after the ATH, and above $50k have already capitulated and redistributed their coins. This sell-side is largely exhausted.\nInvestors continue to see value between $35k and $42k, with accumulation trends remaining very constructive in this region, albeit lacking the momentum to break higher (or lower) just yet.\nThe rate at which both LTH and STH coins fell into an unrealized loss during this correction has been historically significant, suggesting the confidence and conviction of Bitcoin investors has been thoroughly tested.\n\nThe question now becomes, with such significant financial pain already weathered by the market, what will it take to precipitate a final capitulation flush out?\n\nIf we look at the rate of decline of the Short-Term Holder realized cap (cost basis, Z-Score), we can see that it has fallen by yet another historical margin. The magnitude of STH realized losses has only been at a similar magnitude twice in the past, both occurring in the worst phases of the 2018 bear market.\n\nBy this metric, a STH capitulation has already occurred, and it is twice as severe as during the July 2021 bottom at $29k.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nAnd finally, when we perform the same study for Long-Term Holders, we see something even more impressive. The degree to which the Long-Term Holder realized price (currently trading at $14.6k) has declined is the deepest in history, and is without an equal.\n\nThere are only three mechanisms by which the LTH realized cap can decline:\n\nLarge volumes of coins are crossing the 155-day age threshold, and have a much lower acquisition price than the aggregate. This is common after periods of heavy accumulation. Given the 155-day threshold is at the November ATH, this mechanism cannot be the primary contributor as coins maturing of late will have much a higher cost basis than $14.6k.\nExisting LTHs are adding to their balance at prices that are lower than their personal average cost basis. This is a plausible mechanism for class of 2021 LTHs whom have a cost basis > $40k. However, this mechanism is a weak contributor given the aggregate LTH Realized price is much lower at $14.6k.\nLTH held coins that were held at a cost basis much higher than the aggregate ($14.6k) are capitulating. They are leaving the LTH cohort, and redistributing their coins to new STH buyers. This effectively removes high cost basis coins from the aggregate, giving coins with much cheaper cost bases (such as coins from previous cycles) more weight.\n\nPoint 3 is by far the most probable mechanism, signalling that many LTHs who were caught by surprise by the current correction, have now capitulated out of the market...right into the hands of buyers who see value between $35k and $42k.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe Bitcoin market is global, and trades 24/7, making it highly responsive to macroeconomic conditions, shocks, and correlation to traditional assets like equities and bonds. With the current environment having its fair share of headwinds, analysis of Bitcoin market participants on-chain can provide insight into the sentiment and decisions of a cohort of contrarian investors.\n\nWhat we have seen over the last 5-months is a 50%+ correction that appears to have significantly reshuffled the ownership structure of BTC. A great many Long-Term Holders with coins above $50k appear completely unfazed, whilst others have been totally shaken-out, at a historically significant rate.\n\nMany investors are awaiting a complete and total capitulation of of the market, which may well be around the corner given the volume of coins held at a loss, and weak price structure. However under the surface, it appears as though a huge swathe of the market has already capitulated, in a statistically significant manner, and a resilient inflow of demand between $35k to $42k range has quietly absorbed this sell-side in its entirety.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nFeature Release: Workbench Charts are now available in Dashboards\nBug Fix: Fixed bybit related futures perpetual metrics.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nBitcoin as Pristine Collateral\n\nAs the 19 millionth bitcoin is mined, a number of large public buyers have sparked renewed interest in Bitcoin as pristine collateral. Shrimps and Whales are leading widespread coin accumulation, alongside the Luna Foundation Guard who added over 21k BTC to their balance in nine days.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nApr 4, 2022 • 9 min read\n\nIt has been an eventful week in the Bitcoin market, with an uptick in large public buyers such as MacroStrategy, and the Luna Foundation Guard, announcing, or completing significant Bitcoin purchases. With Bitcoin having a deterministic supply schedule and ultimate supply hard-cap, these events represent yet another step towards Bitcoin being perceived by the market as a form of pristine collateral.\n\nThe market traded relatively range-bound this week, between a low of $44,427, and a high of $48,083, consolidating after the recent price rally.\n\nThe perception and utilisation of Bitcoin as a form of financial collateral has been a steadily growing trend, and continues to span into new applications and use-cases. The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) was a dominant buyer throughout last week, with the ultimate intention to use accumulated BTC as a backstop for the UST algorithmic stablecoin. In addition, inflows into wrapped WBTC, Canadian ETFs, and general investor accumulation on-chain has been historically strong, especially following the local price lows set on 22-January.\n\nIn this edition, we will explore a range of major supply sinks for Bitcoin, and characterise the accumulation behaviour over the recent weeks. Accumulation is being driven by both Shrimps (< 1BTC) and Whales (> 1k BTC), alongside these specific public entities (read more on our research describing Shrimps, and Whale holding denominations).\n\nExecutive Summary\nExchanges continue to see significant net coin outflows, with aggregate exchange balances hitting multi-year lows. BTC is flowing out of exchanges at a rate of over 96k BTC/month, signalling historically strong accumulation is taking place.\nAccumulation is being driven by Shrimps (<1 BTC) and Whales (>1k BTC), both of whom have added significantly to their balances over recent weeks.\nLarge scale accumulation by the Luna Foundation Guard has taken place, with an increase of total holdings by 21,163 BTC over the last 9-days. Additionally, the total supply of wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum (WBTC) has grown by 12.5k BTC showing a continuous demand for BTC as collateral in DeFi products.\nCoins have continued to flow into Canadian Bitcoin ETF products, with total holdings increasing by 6,594 BTC since 22-Jan This is a 10.5% growth in coin holdings, despite the plethora of macro and geopolitical risks and headwinds that are in play.\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, and Farsi. Note, we are seeking a new translator for our Italian edition of the newsletter.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further n our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nBitcoin Milestone: 19 Millionth BTC Mined\n\nThis week the total Bitcoin supply reached the 19-millionth coin mined, leaving less than 9.52% of the final 21M supply left to be mined over the next ~118 years. At the time of writing (block height 730,278), the total BTC supply was 19,001,529.68 BTC, with a daily issuance of 918 BTC/day (14-day median basis).\n\nLive Chart\nA Week of Historically Strong Accumulation\n\nAs noted in the introduction, it has been a particularly impressive week for BTC accumulation trends, with both discrete public buyers, and the wider market adding to their balances.\n\nThe Accumulation Trend Score is one of our latest tools released to track the relative on-chain balance change of the market at large. Values closer to 1 (purple) indicate that whales and/or a large proportion of market entities are adding significantly to their balances. This week returned a consistent stream of values upwards of 0.65, which indicates a general trend of accumulation is underway.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can see that exchange balances have also experienced a historically significant period of BTC outflows in response, reaching an outflow rate of 96.2k BTC/month. Outflows of this magnitude are uncommon, having happened on only several occasions through history.\n\nA very noticeable transition from net inflows (green), into a regime of dominant outflows (red) remains in play, a trend that started immediately following the March 2020 market crash.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe impact of such a sustained, and high magnitude of BTC outflows is that the total balance held on exchanges has proceeded to multi-year lows. Over the course of March, over 96k BTC flowed out of the exchanges we track, reaching levels last seen in August 2018. Note that this represents a notable break downwards from the generally sideways plateau in exchange balances that was established from September 2021.\n\nLive Chart\n\nDiving deeper into specific exchanges, we can see that the majority of outflows are coming out of the largest exchanges in the industry. Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, Kraken, Bittrex and Bitstamp have seen significant net outflows of late, despite many of these seeing net balance increases over the last 12-24months. Binance in particular, which saw its coin balance dominance explode higher in 2021, has seen over 20.8k BTC in outflows over the last 2-weeks.\n\nLive Chart\nSo Who is Accumulating?\n\nHaving established that a general trend of accumulation is taking place, we can now characterise the types of buyers participating. We can see that the Accumulation Balance continues to climb. This supply represents coins that are held in addresses with more than one deposit, and no history of spending. This metric excludes exchanges and miners, but will include large entities like custodians, LFG, and MacroStrategy.\n\nThe total balance held in Accumulation Addresses has risen by 217k BTC over the last four months, measured since the market deleveraging event on 4-December. This represents a growth rate of 1,800 BTC/day which is 2x the daily issuance to miners. Note that this also breaks away from a generally sideways balance trend established through most of 2021.\n\nLive Chart\n\nNext we look at on-chain entities with balances less than 1BTC, often referred to as Bitcoin Shrimp. These buyers are most likely to be retail level, or individuals, and this cohort has been aggressively accumulating since the local price lows set on 22-Jan. Over the course of the last ~2 months, Bitcoin shrimp have accumulated 0.579% of the circulating supply, which is 1.7x more coins than were mined over the same time.\n\nBitcoin Shrimp currently hold 14.256% of the coin supply in aggregate (note that this does not include any supply held by exchanges, which represent an additional thousands to millions of retail level customers in aggregate).\n\nLive Chart\n\nNext we look to the average supply held in each address associated with larger Bitcoin holders with 100 to 10k BTC in holdings (sharks to whales). Since August 2021, the average volume of BTC held in each address by this cohort has plateaued between 570 and 585 BTC per address. This is the result of both supply held, and address counts in this cohort remaining fairly stable over this time. This generally suggests that this wallet cohort are contributing the least to the current accumulation trends.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFinally, we can confirm and refine the above observations by looking to an unreleased metric from the Glassnode Engine Room, which breaks down the Accumulation Trend Score into wallet cohorts. Here we can see that smaller buyers (up to 100 BTC) have been the heavy accumulators since late-Jan, with the smaller balances (<1 BTC) being the most aggressive (green zone).\n\nWe can also see the 100-1k BTC wallet cohorts have contributed the least to the overall accumulation (red zone), whilst Whale cohorts (>1k BTC) have commenced serious accumulation over the last two weeks. This includes entities such as LFG, which we will explore more in the next section.\n\nUnreleased metric from the Glassnode Engine Room\nMajor Bitcoin Supply Sinks\n\nWe have established that a very large volume of BTC is being accumulated by Whale entities (> 1k BTC) over the last two weeks. One of the most public entities has been the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), which has now amassed a trove of 30,727 BTC. With an initial purchase of 9,564 BTC in late-Jan, valued at $358.6M at the time, the LFG balance has now grown by 21,163 BTC over a nine-day period. The total value of the LFG balance is now over $1.40 Billion.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe trend of wrapping Bitcoin into a tokenised variant, for deployment on other blockchains has also been a steady over recent years. Over 1.449% of the Bitcoin supply (275,236 BTC) is now held by the custodian BitGo, and issued as a tokenized version WBTC on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSince the market lows on 22-Jan, the WBTC supply has grown by an additional 12.5k BTC, demonstrating an increased demand for Bitcoin collateral in DeFi, despite the chaotic macro and geopolitical conditions.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThere has also been notable inflows into various Canadian ETFs, with Purpose ETF receiving the lions share of inflows. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF currently holds 35k BTC, seeing net inflows of 5,521 BTC since the 22-Jan price lows. This is a net growth of 18.7% of total BTC holdings in this time, amidst a storm of macro and geopolitical headwinds. The Purpose Bitcoin ETF now has $1.627B in assets under management.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn aggregate, the total holdings of all Canadian ETF products has risen by 6,594 BTC since late January, reaching an all-time-high of just over 69k BTC (0.36% of circulating supply).\n\nIt is quite impressive to observe such strong outflows from exchanges (spot holdings), as well as inflows into both ETF products, DeFi applications, and on-chain accumulation wallets, despite the numerous macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds of recent months.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe Bitcoin market has seen a number of weeks of historically strong accumulation, which has been fairly widespread in relation to participation across wallet cohorts. Shrimp and Whales are the most aggressive accumulators of late, with a number of large public buyers such as LFG and MacroStrategy adding renewed emphasis on Bitcoin as pristine collateral.\n\nWhat is most impressive is the general increase in Bitcoin demand across ETF products available in Canada, despite the plethora of headwinds such as conflict in Ukraine, commodity price rises and shortages, and tightening monetary condition.\n\nIn general, the market appears to be viewing Bitcoin and its role in the future economy with a somewhat renewed optimism. This is most clearly reflected in the net trend of outflows from exchanges, and into self or assisted-custody, a trend which started immediately following the March 2020 liquidity crisis.\n\nWith the 19 millionth coin now mined, and general accumulation exceeding daily issuance by many multiples, the scarcity and pristine nature of Bitcoin as collateral may well be returning to the foreground once again.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nMetric Release: Luna Foundation Guard Balance\nUncharted Newsletter Edition #12 released.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Road to Recovery\n\nBitcoin markets have rallied higher this week, as supply older than 1yr pushes towards new all-time-highs. In this analysis, we explore the longer term road to recovery, and how supply dynamics have historically signalled when bearish markets are coming to a conclusion.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nMar 28, 2022 • 10 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has seen a stronger week, rallying off the lows of $40,710, and breaking out of the consolidation range to a new local high of $47,649. This is the first sustained rally after many months of sideways choppy price action.\n\nOver the last few months, we have outlined various cases and angles that describe Bitcoins market structure as being in what is most likely a bear market, arguably commencing as far back as May 2021. However, as the market saying goes, bear markets author the bulls that follow.\n\nThe process of bottom formation and investor capitulation in a bear market is often a lengthy and painful process, and Bitcoin is by no means out of the bearish woods yet. Nevertheless, in this edition we seek to look further out, in an attempt to identify metrics that are indicate whether a constructive recovery is underway in the longer term.\n\nExecutive Summary\nThe proportion of coin supply aged 1yr+ is rapidly approaching all-time-highs, as coins accumulated in Q1 of the 2021 bull market remain unspent in investor wallets.\nThis generally signifies that Bitcoin investors maintain a strong conviction in the asset, despite the many macro and geopolitical headwinds.\nComparing these supply dynamics to past cycles, it is most likely that Bitcoin is well into the second half of the bear market.\nThere is however modest spending taking place by owners of more mature coins (possible smart money divestment), however heavy accumulation appears to have taken place between $35k and $42k absorbing the sell-side pressure.\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, and Farsi.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nOld Supply Approaches New Highs\n\nOne of the foundational tools we use to assess investor conviction in on-chain analysis is coin lifespan (or coin age). Lifespan is broadly defined as the period of time since the coin was last moved (time since UTXO creation).\n\nStatistically speaking, the longer a coin remains dormant, the more likely it is to remain so. Given Bitcoin's characteristic volatility, investors who hold coins for an extended period of time are more likely to experience wild price swings, and are thus more likely to be experienced, and higher conviction HODLers.\n\nAs we approach the end of Q1-2022, we can see an extraordinary increase in the proportion of coins aged 1yr+, which has risen by 9.4% of circulating supply over the last 8-months. These coins largely reflect BTC volumes accumulated in the Q1-2021 phase of the bull market and the owners have thus held through two 50%+ drawdowns, and three all-time highs. This recovery is quite similar in scale and duration to the 2018-19 recovery.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhilst the chart above shows BTC volume > 1yr as a proportion of circulating supply, it is also useful to know how much USD denominated 'wealth' is held in those coins. The reality that most investors make decisions regarding portfolio allocations in relation to its fiat denominated value, and cost basis, and thus proportional USD value is very relevant.\n\nThe Realized Cap HODL waves  are the ideal tool for this assessment, and the chart below is filtered for these same 1yr+ old coins. We can see the following:\n\nQ2-Q4 of 2021 has many similarities to past bear markets where the total wealth held in 1yr+ coins reached a cycle minimum from May to Dec 2021.\nBear Phase 1: When a low proportion of wealth is held by older, more experienced investors, it means the converse is true, and much of the wealth is held by newer, less experienced investors, which is top formation and bear market material.\nBear Phase 2: This wealth disparity is recovering strongly as more coins transition into 1yr+ age bands, and more wealth, with a higher cost basis is is HODLed (setting a higher floor value than the last cycle).\n\nThe current market is in the process of recovering (Phase 2), however it can be seen in past cycles, this process can take many months for a price floor to fully form, and find sustained upside momentum.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOn-chain analysts will often consider an abundance of 'older coins' as a signal of market strength and conviction for the following reasons:\n\nMacro increases in the aggregate lifespan of the coin supply show a desire to hold BTC, despite volatile price swings, suggesting higher investor conviction, and future value expectations.\nIt reflects a general reduction in 'liquid' coin supply available for marginal buyers purchase as a result of historical accumulation by 'smarter money' buyers.\n\nThe RHODL Ratio captures this behaviour into a single elegant oscillator. It calculated as the ratio between 1-week old, and 1yr-old Realized Cap HODL Wave bands. It will peak when a maximum USD wealth is held by new investors (market tops) and bottom when more of the wealth is held by 1yr age bands (market bottoms).\n\nHere we can see a macro downtrend is in now play, reflecting the growth in 1yr+ coins moving into the metric denominator. RHODL currently describes a balance between new, and experienced HODLers that is coincident with late stage bear markets, and also with early stage bull markets. Note however that only in 2012 was RHODL in a macro downtrend, whilst market pricing was in a bull market.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAnother oscillator that captures an impressive amount of investor psychology one elegant curve is Reserve Risk. This metric will trade at low levels when there is heavy investor accumulation and HODLing is the preferred market strategy. Conversely, it is extremely reflexive to the upside (requires a log scale) when these experienced investors exit their positions.\n\nReserve Risk has traded at historically undervalued levels for 77-days so far, although this is far shorter than the multi-year periods seen in 2015-17 and 2018-20. Note however that Reserve Risk generally signals undervaluation well into the bull market as HODLers typically commence distribution only after a new price ATH is set (explored further here).\n\nLive Chart\n\nVisit our Reserve Risk metric user guide, or video tutorial below for more information.\n\nShort Term Support meets Long-Term Spending\n\nAs is seen in the above metrics, the transition from bear to bull is rarely obvious at the time, and usually takes long periods of time to play out. An underlying reason for this is that even the strongest of hands may take exit liquidity during bear market rallies to conserve and maximise capital efficiency.\n\nIf we look to the Spent Volume Age Bands (SVAB), we can see that a sizeable portion of the 6-month+ aged coins have increased their spending throughout March. Around 2% of all on-chain transaction volume is associated with these coins which is relatively significant.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis is confirmed by looking to Revived Supply 1yr+, which demonstrates that between 7k to 10k BTC aged 1yr+ have been spent per day over the last 30-days. There are two takeaway interpretations from this:\n\nOlder coins are on the move during this price consolidation, which suggests a degree of investor uncertainty, and de-risking is taking place. This is likely to create overhead supply that must be absorbed.\nMarket prices have not broken to new lows despite this additional sell-side pressure, suggesting that there has been sufficient demand to absorb this expenditure.\nLive Chart\n\nReturning the the Realized Cap HODL waves, we will now look to the younger coin bands, aged 1-month and less. Here we can see that around 16.23% of the USD wealth stored in Bitcoin is currently held in these younger age bands. These bands will swell only when the above older coins are spent and change hands to newer buyers.\n\nDuring late stage bears, these age bands tend to reach relative minimum values, as all remaining speculators and market tourists leave the space, and smarter money accumulate coins at cheaper prices. The proportion of value held in these age bands is similar to the 'disbelief and exit liquidity' periods of 2012, 2016 and 2019-20.\n\nLive Chart\n\nSupporting the suite of observations above, we have the Realized Price Distribution of the current UTXO set (TA analogy: on-chain volume profile). This version is an unreleased version of the URPD that is broken into Long-term and Short-Term Holder cohorts.\n\nWhat we can see two important observations:\n\nLong-Term Holders still hold a very large proportion of supply that was acquired at higher prices (> $45k). These coins are holding an unrealized loss, and likely have been for a number of months. It is notable that these investors are yet to liquidate, suggesting strong sentiment persists.\nShort-Term Holders have accumulated a large proportion of the supply between $38k and $45k. This indicates that many investors see the current consolidation range as a value zone, and this has similar characteristics to the $30k to $40k range of May-July 2021 (explored in Week 29, 2021)\n\nRisks remain that these buyers may be sensitive to any downside volatility. However, the degree of accumulation that appears to have taken place during this consolidation range, especially in the face of world changing macro and geopolitical risks, is truly a signal of strength and conviction in Bitcoin.\n\nUnreleased Metric from the glassnode Engine Room\nShort-Term Pain for Long-Term Gain\n\nBitcoin bear markets have historically ended with one last major flush out. A capitulation event that shakes out even the most hardened HODLers. Examples include Jan 2015, Nov 2018, and March 2020, all of which saw Bitcoin prices drop over 50% in just a few days.\n\nDuring these events, All remaining sellers are exhausted, and we typically see both profitable coins and underwater coins sold at scale. The chart below presents the degree of profit/loss realised on coins specifically sent to exchanges (most likely for sales).\n\nWe can see that we have experienced two such events in the last 12-months, although they are of notably smaller magnitude relative to the 2018-20 bear cycle. Given two 50% drawdowns in this time, it is more likely this reflects increased investor confidence in Bitcoin as a viable asset on the macro stage.\n\nUnreleased Metric from the glassnode Engine Room\n\nThe concept of 'realized value' is captured entirely within the Realized Cap, which reflects the aggregate investor cost basis for the Short-Term and Long-Term Holder cohorts. The chart below shows:\n\nThe Short-Term Holder Realized Cap (pink) is more volatile, and typically provides resistance in a bear market (investors selling at their cost basis). It is currently trading at $45.9k. This is a key level to watch in case the market can break and hold it, which may suggest a regime shift towards greener pastures.\nThe Long-Term Holder Realized Cap (blue) is much slower moving, lags the standard Realized Price (orange) by ~155-days, and rarely trends downwards.\n\nA downtrend in the LTH Realized Cap indicates that the aggregate LTH cost basis is declining. This can only happen when\n\nLTHs who bough the top capitulate, or\nWhen 155-days ago LTHs accumulated large coin volumes at cheaper prices.\n\nGiven 155-days ago was the October ATH, this makes point 1) the more likely outcome, suggesting LTHs have, or are well into the process of capitulation.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo Finalise this observation, we introduce the LTH Realized Cap Net Position Change Z-Score. This metric:\n\nCalculates the 30-day change in LTH realized cap as a gauge for USD denominated capital inflow/outflow into this cohort.\nConverts to a Z-Score to enable comparison to past cycles where USD valuations were much smaller.\nHigh Values indicates that large volumes of USD value are maturing into LTHs status, lifting their aggregate cost basis.\nLow Values indicate that the LTH cost basis is declining significantly, driven by points 1) and/or 2) above.\n\nWhat we see is that LTHs are currently experiencing the largest decline in their aggregate cost basis in history, with the Z-Score is trading 2.33 standard deviations below the mean. When coupled with the URPD metric and the Profit/Loss bands to exchanges metric, this describes a very healthy redistribution of coin supply from higher prices, into a new floor range between $38k and $45k.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nBitcoin bear markets can be long, painful, and drawn out, however they have the ultimate result of reshuffling supply ownership away from weaker, and towards stronger hands. Bitcoin has seen fairly heavy accumulation occur between $35k and $42k, suggesting many investors see a value zone in the current consolidation range.\n\nThere is modest spending taking place over the past few weeks, with much of it being coins held at a loss. As a result, the aggregate cost bases of both Long- and Short-Term holders are in decline, the former to a historically significant degree. So far the Bitcoin bulls have provided adequate support\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nMetric Release: US Month-over-Month Price Change, EU Month-over-Month Price Change, Asia Month-over-Month Price Change\nReleased new metric Accumulation Trend Score.\nReleased new metric Supply by TxOut Type.\nUncharted Newsletter Edition #11 released.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nHigh Volatility Is On the Horizon\n\nBitcoin futures and options markets are pricing in higher volatility in the near future. Meanwhile, on-chain activity remains firmly in bear market territory, but continues to recover meaningfully.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nMar 21, 2022 • 11 min read\n\nBitcoin markets have seen another week of low volatility and price consolidation, trading up from $37,680 and towards the range high of $42,312 over the weekend. As prices trade within this narrow range, and volatility is squeezed out of the market, the odds of higher volatility in the near-term builds.\n\nIn this edition, we will focus on three core areas of the market, in an attempt to characterise the most likely mechanisms driving the next major move in the market:\n\nGeographical dominance of buy and sell-side pressure using a suite of newly released metrics.\nOn-chain activity and supply maturation metrics which describe the recovery of the network user-base in bear markets.\nDerivatives markets which price in current, and future volatility, as well as provide insight into behaviours associated with risk-neutral cash and carry positioning.\nExecutive Summary\nCurrent buy side demand appears to be dominated by US and EU markets, with the majority of sell-side sources during Asian trading hours.\nBitcoin network utilisation and on-chain activity remains firmly within bear market territory, albeit is recovering. A sustained upwards impulse in network activity would likely be constructive, whilst deterioration likely favours the bears.\nThe amount of BTC supply absorbed during the current drawdown is similar in magnitude to the period after the March 2020 sell-off. However it remains modest at best, and is a key metric to keep an eye on in coming weeks.\nDerivatives markets are currently pricing in historically low implied volatility, and futures premiums. Such market structure has historically preceded periods of very high volatility, and most often to the upside.\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, Portuguese, and Farsi.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nWestern Markets Bid, whilst Asia Dominates Sell-side\n\nWe released a suite of three new metrics last week, which track the cumulative 30-day price change in US, EU and Asian trading hours. These metrics provide insight into which geographic areas of the market are leading, or lagging in buy and sell-side pressure, particularly in reaction to fundamental changes in market structure.\n\nOver the course of 2020 to 2022, US and EU markets have acted similarly with the following general structure:\n\nGeneral accumulation and bid support following the March 2020 sell-off. This is likely in response to the expansionary monetary policies, and fiat currency debasement enacted by western central banks at this time.\nHeavy buy side during late 2020 to early 2021 bull market. US markets led this demand side through to January, with demand from European market bid support being heaviest in the Mar-May 2021 top.\nBoth regions capitulated throughout May-July, although the US notably led buy side recovery into September. There was notably less buy side from US and EU at the November top relative to August.\nEurope is providing the largest bid support at present, although overall price changes are only moderately positive, and yet to signal the return of sustainable bull market style demand.\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nAsian markets tell a notably different story. In the chart below, we show US (blue) and EU (purple) ghost traces for ease of comparison. For Asian markets:\n\nPrimarily sell-side pressure after March 2020, potentially signalling a very different market expectation regarding the impact COVID would have on the global economy.\nNotably lower participation and buy side demand throughout Q1-Q3 of 2021, however notably, demand in Asia peaked around the lows of bull market corrections.\nWide-scale sell-side at the lows in July 2021, with demand only peaking at the Oct-Nov All-time-highs. All three regions 'bought the top' at this time, but Asian demand eclipsed both US and EU.\nHeavy sell-side dominance during the current draw-down, which has been sustained since December 2021, and is likely in response to heavier buy-side at the top.\nLive Workbench Chart\nNew Glassnode Content\n\nPart 3 of the Bear Market Survival Guide is live, focusing on late stage bears, and observations related to the final Capitulation Event.\n\nThe On-chain Recovery Grinds On\n\nA useful tool-set for tracking Bitcoin demand is the analysis of on-chain activity, ranging from active addresses, new on-chain entities, transaction counts, and transfer volumes. Typically we see these style activity metrics collapse during early bear markets, and begin to signal recovery as smart-money demand increases at depressed prices.\n\nNote that a new On-chain Entity is defined as a cluster of addresses that have no association with existing clusters. This metric therefore reflects new entrants to the network, or existing entities whom are not interacting with their existing addresses (e.g. HODLers with good privacy practices who avoid address re-use and combining UTXOs).\n\nWe can clearly see the accelerated growth rate in new on-chain entities a bull (blue), followed by a heavy collapse at the start of a bear (pink). Bear markets are characterised by a fairly persistent grind higher in new entities entering the Bitcoin network.\n\nThe current rate of 110k new on-chain entities per day is similar to the peak of the 2019 mini-bull, and is on a modest upwards trajectory.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA similar trend is observable in transaction counts, although the current rate of 215k Tx/day is lower that what was observed throughout 2019.\n\nFor metrics like active addresses, new on-chain entities, and transaction counts, an accelerated growth rate higher would be a constructive signal, and likely support a healthy recovery in prices. Conversely, a deterioration in network utilisation would be a more bearish observation, and one to watch out for as a sign of demand exhaustion.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOne piece of data that is not captured by the analysis of active addresses/entities and transaction counts is the economic weight of these network users. Where the general characteristics of the above metrics are similar to the 2019-20 bear market recovery, transaction volumes and value settlement are notably different.\n\nThe 2017 bull market top was followed by a near complete 'destruction' of the new transaction volume that pushed prices to the cycle all-time-high of $20k. Throughout 2018 and 2019, daily settlement volume languished at around $1.5B/day, a level first established in July 2017. Large size transactions (>$1M in value) represented between 10% and 30% of all volume at this time.\n\nIn the 2021-22 bear market however, total daily value settlement has continued to trend higher, as measured at the lows of both 50%+ draw-downs. Large size transactions also now represent a sustained 65% to 70% dominance.\n\nNote that transaction volumes are currently at the lows of this established range, and a severe decline may signal a reduction in network utilisation, and would likely favour a bearish case.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe current drawdown has now been in play for 132-days since the Nov ATH, and the tail of our 155-day threshold used to define Long-Term Holder status is approaching the October price high. As such, we can make a broad assertion that Long-Term Holders own coins before the market high, and Short-Term Holders own coins purchased during or after the market top.\n\nWith this in mind, we can see that Long-Term Holder (LTH) supply holdings have stagnated since the October peak. This suggests that the volume of coins maturing into LTH status, is being met by equal spending pressure by this cohort.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo assess whether Short-Term holders are likely to become LTHs, we can look to the 3m-6m old HODL wave band. This age band is selected due to these coins being accumulated and HODLed through the worst phase of this drawdown. This likely increases the odds that the owners are more price insensitive (else they would have spent and redistributed already, as many have, described in Week 9).\n\nThe volume of coins that have now entered this age band is currently at 480k BTC, which is large on paper, but remains well below what we have seen preceding significant bullish impulses in 2019 and 2021. It is however similar to the March 2020 accumulation of 510k BTC, which is noteworthy given the scale of that economic shock is comparable to current conflict, commodity inflation, and supply chain disruptions.\n\nContinuation of an uptrend in both of these supply held metrics would be constructive, however declines in both would suggest a lack of incoming accumulation alongside increasing spending by LTHs (Bitcoins stronger holders).\n\nLive Chart\nDerivatives Price in Volatility Ahead\n\nIn our newsletter published in mid-Feb (Week 7) we described how derivative markets were pricing in uncertainty and risk, largely associated with impacts of the Federal Reserve rate hike in March. With the Fed having announced an expected 0.25% to 0.5% rate hike this week, both futures and options markets are beginning to price in higher implied volatility in the short-term.\n\nThe futures market term structure remains either flat, or in backwardation for all exchanges through to April, with only a 4.46% annualised premium priced out to years-end.\n\nLive Chart\n\nImplied volatility priced into at-the-money options markets is also climbing in recent weeks. This is despite prices trading in a sideways range which usually lead a compression in implied volatility.\n\nOptions implied volatility is coming off relatively low levels between 60% and 80%, which have historically been followed by periods of extremely high volatility. Such high volatility events in 2021 include the May sell-off, the short-squeeze in July, and the October rally to ATHs.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we look to the degree of leverage in Futures markets, we can see that open interest is on a steady ascent, reaching 1.94% of the Bitcoin market cap. Through 2021, leverage ratios of more than 2.0% of market cap have historically been high risk periods, often followed by a violent de-leveraging event (either a short or a long squeeze).\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nNote that given the relatively poor price performance of markets of late (both Bitcoin and TradFi) in recent months, there are two likely mechanisms driving this basis compression:\n\nRisk neutral cash and carry trades, as investors seek any available positive rates of nominal return.\nShort sellers and risk hedging via futures in preference to the sale of spot to reduce net exposure (explored in the Week 7 newsletter).\n\nAs a result of increased demand to capture futures premium during this drawdown, we can see that the 3-month rolling basis has compressed to an annualised return of just 3.5%. Basis compression to this extent has only been seen in Sept 2020, and at market the lows in June-July 2021, both of which preceded very violent upside rallies.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOf particular note is the open interest leverage in perpetual futures markets. Here we can see that the total value of open interest in perpetual swaps is now 1.28% of the Bitcoin market cap, which is a historically high risk zone. It also demonstrates that the market is currently preferentially deploying capital into perpetual swaps, rather than expiring futures.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nIf we calculate the annualised rolling basis from perpetual funding rates (pink), we can compare to the rate of return available from the rolling premium priced into 3-month expiring futures (blue). From this study, we can draw the following conclusions:\n\nPerpetual futures basis are significantly more volatile than that of expiring futures. This is likely a result of demand for leverage in an instrument that closely tracks spot markets via price indexes, and the subsequent incentive that funding rates creates for traders to take the other side of the trade.\nPeriods where perpetual basis trades lower than 3M basis have historically reflected periods of near-term undervaluation (marked in green), either at the lows of bull market corrections, or during more prolonged bearish trends.\nConversely, periods where the perpetual basis is significantly higher than 3M basis have signalled short-term market tops when the demand for leverage in perpetual markets creates an oversupply as traders arbitrage down high funding rates.\n\nThe perpetual futures basis has now traded below 3M basis since mid-November, and is in the process of breaking above it. In combination with the above observation that 3M rolling basis is historically low, this suggests that a regime change in market structure, and higher volatility likely lies ahead.\n\nIt also suggests that a maximum number of traders are in risk neutral positions (cash and carry), and perhaps waiting for confirmation to deploy capital into a trend.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe Bitcoin market has now been in a drawdown from the November ATH for 132-days, and prices have consolidated inside the present trading range for over 2-months. This has lead to a compression of yields available from cash-and-carry trades in futures markets, and lower implied volatility in options markets.\n\nAt the moment, we have implied volatility climbing, and leverage ratios in futures markets approaching overheated levels, particularly across perpetual futures. Market structure such as this has preceded periods of very high volatility, as was seen in May 2021, and Aug 2021, and thus suggests a regime of higher volatility may be around the corner.\n\nOn-chain activity and supply dynamics remain firmly in bear market territory in magnitude and trend, but are somewhat directionless in their forward bias. Should evidence of strength appear in the form of accelerating on-chain activity, and increased supply migrating into long-term holder hands it would favour the bulls, especially given volatility expectations. Similarly, deterioration would favour the bears.\n\nThe market spring appears to be coiled, and a period of higher volatility just over the horizon seems increasingly likely.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nMetric Release: US Month-over-Month Price Change, EU Month-over-Month Price Change, Asia Month-over-Month Price Change\nReleased new metric Accumulation Trend Score.\nReleased new metric Supply by TxOut Type.\nUncharted Newsletter Edition #11 released.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nShort-Term Supply Dwindles\n\nBitcoin accumulation trends have softened in the short term, despite extremely constructive long-term demand trends. The potential energy for a capitulation event is in place, but is yet to manifest as it has in previous market cycles.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nMar 14, 2022 • 9 min read\n\nBitcoin prices continue to consolidate this week, compressing into an increasingly tight range between a low of $37,274, and a high of $42,455. As was covered in the previous edition, the market currently exists in a delicate balance, amidst a backdrop of high macro and geopolitical uncertainty playing out on the global stage.\n\nWe are now two years on from the major capitulation event in March 2020 that saw Bitcoin prices plummet over 52%, fall from $8k to $3.8k in two trading days, and marked the end of the 2019-20 bear cycle. Capitulation events like this often signify a complete and total flush out of all remaining sellers, turning the tides in the favour of the bulls.\n\nIn this edition, we will assess the current balance between buyers and sellers in an attempt to gauge how close we may be to the end of the current bear cycle.\n\nExecutive Summary\nUncertainty and macro risks are a current headwind, which are manifesting as softened short-term accumulation trends.\nSpending by older coins over the last week is also marginally more bearish than recent weeks, although is still not at levels that signify widespread fear or loss of conviction.\n82% of the supply held by Short-Term Holders (2.51M BTC) is currently held at an unrealised loss, whilst total supply held by Long-Term Holders is near all-time-highs.\nDespite weaker short-term demand, HODLing remains the preferred strategy, with the proportion of younger coins now at all-time-lows. This is historically associated with late stage bear markets.\nWe introduce a new concept called market inflation rate which shows that on an annualised basis, Long-Term Holders are adding to their balance at a volume 7.6x larger than mining issuance. This is constructive longer-term.\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, and Portuguese.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nUncertainty Softens Short-Term Accumulation\n\nTo set the stage, we begin with a metric newly released this week, the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score. This tool is designed to monitor the big picture aggregate accumulation, or distribution of investor wallets. This tool tracks when large entities (aka whales) and/or large portions of the market (aka shrimps in large numbers) are adding to their coin holdings, whilst also filtering out miners and exchanges.\n\nThe metric trades between values of 0 and 1 with the following interpretation:\n\nValues closer to 0 (yellow/orange) indicate the market is distributing, or there is little meaningful accumulation taking place (bearish).\nValues closer o 1 (purple) indicate that the market is in net accumulation with investor wallet balances increasing meaningfully (bullish).\n\nWe can see that the period from October 2021 to Jan 2022 was one of very strong accumulation (> 0.9, dark purple), likely by price insensitive HODLers. However, for most of 2022, this metric has fluctuated between a value of 0.2 and 0.5. This highlights the impact of global macro uncertainty on investor sentiment, with weaker accumulation taking place as a result.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe have also released a video guide to the Accumulation Trend Score below.\n\nThis week we have also seen a notable increase in older coins being spent. Older coins are held by investors who have more experience with the characteristic volatility of Bitcoin markets, and are often considered synonymous with 'smarter money'.\n\nAs such, when we see older coins being spent at higher levels, it can indicate a more bearish tilt in sentiment within the HODLer class. Coins older than 6mths represented 5% of all spending volume this week, which is a notable uptick from recent months.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also see this in the Binary Coin-days Destroyed metric with a 7-day moving average applied. This metric will trade higher when older coins are spent in a sustained manner. Low values (green zones) are typical of accumulation phases in a bear market, whilst elevated values (red zones) are typical of bullish trends, as long-term investors sell into market strength.\n\nSince September last year, Binary CDD has traded consistently higher than a typical accumulation phase. This further suggests that there remains some degree of long-term investor de-risking taking place.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe unit we measure to track the aggregate age of coins being spent is called a coin-day. It represents the amount of time a coin has remained dormant in an investor wallet. On a more macro view, the aggregate sum of coin-day destruction over the last 90-days remains historically low.\n\nDuring bear markets, the CDD-90 metric trades at low levels as investors slowly accumulate coins and there is an aggregate preference for HODLing. It will however spike higher following capitulation events, as fear and panic creates a final wave of sell-side pressure, which exhausts all remaining bears.\n\nThis metric does suggest that accumulation and HODLing is the preferred behaviour pattern at present. We have yet to see a final capitulation event in this bear cycle however, which has happened in all previous cycles. It remains to be seen if this time is different.\n\nLive Chart\nShort-Term Supply Shrinks\n\nThe chart below shows the relative proportion of the coin supply held by Short-Term Holders (STHs) who accumulated within the last 155-days. This cohort are statistically the most likely to sell their coins in the face of market volatility, especially during a final capitulation flush out.\n\nSupporting our observations above, we continue to see the amount of coin supply held by the Short-Term Holder cohort decline. This can only occur when large portions of the coin supply are dormant and crossing the 155-day age threshold, becoming Long-Term Holder supply. STH supply reaching low levels is historically associated with the later stages of bear markets, as patient buyers send coins to cold storage for the long hold.\n\nSTH supply is currently near all-time-lows which is constructive for prices. However, 82% of these coins (2.51M BTC) are currently held at a loss, and are in turn the most likely source of sell-side pressure.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe HODL waves are also showing that coins younger than 6-months old are at all-time-lows. 24.53% of the circulating supply is in this young age cohort, which means that 75.47% of the supply has remained dormant for more than 6-months.\n\nThis is again a relatively constructive observation for prices and indicates that HODLing is dominating investor behaviour, even with the prevailing macro risks as headwinds.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhilst a the proportion of young coin supply is declining, it holds an increasingly large proportion of the realised value compared to previous cycles. In other words, an increasingly large amount of the USD denominated capital invested in Bitcoin is currently held in coins accumulated in the last 6-months.\n\nLate stage bear markets are similarly characterised by lower proportions of capital held by these younger coins, as coins mature in longer-term investor wallets. The 3m-6m age band in particular (top yellow band in chart below) is currently swelling significantly, indicating that a large volume of the supply purchased between September and December last year remains held tightly.\n\nLive Chart\nSigns of Long-Term Demand Persist\n\nHaving now established a macro context of sell-side supply, we now look towards signals of longer range demand (3mths+).\n\nCoinbase in particular has seen a very large net outflow this week, totalling 31,130 BTC ($1.18B). This is the largest net outflow since 28-July-2017. The regime of net outflows (red bars) following March 2020 is also quite apparent in the chart below. This remains a strong signal that investors increasingly see Bitcoin as a relevant asset in modern portfolios.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis outflow has dropped the total balance held on Coinbase to 649.5k BTC, bringing it back to levels last seen at the 2017 bull market top. The total Bitcoin balance held by Coinbase has now declined by 375.5k BTC (36.6%) from the ATH reached in April 2020.\n\nLarge outflows like this one are actually part of a consistent trend in the Coinbase balance, which has been stair-stepping downwards over the last two years. As the largest exchange by BTC balance, and a preferred venue for US based institutions, this further supports the adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset by larger institutions.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIf we look at the Illiquid Supply Shock Ratio (ISSR), we can see a significant uptick this week, suggesting that these withdrawn coins have been moved into a wallet with little-to-no history of spending.\n\nThis metric will trend higher as more coins move into such wallets, and we can see that it currently has a similar market structure to the 2018-20 bear market, albeit on a shorter time scale. The ISSR metric is currently at 3.2, which means that the amount of supply held in Illiquid wallets is 3.2x larger than Liquid and Highly Liquid supply combined.\n\nThis metric does indicates that a persistent demand is present, despite struggling prices.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo close, we introduce a concept that has been recently developed in collaboration with David Puell (Ark Invest) that we call the 'market inflation rate'. This metric is a measure of annualised accumulation or distribution rates by LTHs.\n\nFirst we consider Bitcoin issuance to miners relative to circulating supply as the nominal inflation rate (yellow trace), which is assumed to be a persistent sell-side pressure.\n\nNext we annualised the daily change in Long-Term Holder supply relative to circulating supply as a measure of market demand. We multiply the value by negative 1 such that LTH accumulation will return a negative rate (bullish), whilst LTH divestment will return a positive rate (bearish).\n\nFinally, we add this LTH accumulation rate to the nominal inflation rate to calculate the market inflation rate (green trace). What we can see is:\n\nDuring late stage bear markets, market inflation rates are deeply negative (available supply is deflationary), hitting -14% to -15%. This means LTHs are accumulating ~15% of the circulating supply per year over and above miner issuance.\nAt bull market tops, market inflation peaks above nominal inflation, indicating that LTHs are adding significantly to sell-side pressure via divestment (available supply is very inflationary). This ultimately leads to an oversupply and initiates a bear market.\n\nAt present, the LTH market inflation rate is at -10.9%, which means LTHs are currently adding to their balance at 7.6x the rate of issuance. This is approaching historical lows that have signalled bear market lows in past cycles, and is another constructive long-term undertone.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nUncertainty associated with the many macro and geopolitical risks risks have weakened shorter-term on-chain accumulation trends since January. We can also see marginally elevated spending by older coins this week, although it is still not suggestive of any widespread loss of investor conviction on a macro scale.\n\nWith over 2.51M BTC held by Short-term Holders at an unrealised loss, there remains a risk that sellers have not yet been fully exhausted. The 'potential energy' for a capitulation event is there, and such an event would be consistent with all prior bear cycles.\n\nHowever, HODLing does continue to dominate investor behaviour, and the longer-term accumulation trends are still impressively constructive.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReleased new metric Accumulation Trend Score.\nReleased new metric Supply by TxOut Type.\nImprovement: we now exclude coinbase transactions in the Entity-Adjusted transaction metrics for BTC.\nUncharted Newsletter Edition #10 released.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nA Delicate Equilibrium\n\nThe Bitcoin market is in a delicate equilibrium, with limited incoming demand, alongside a slowing sell-side. In this edition, we analyse exchange flows specifically to assess the characteristics of Bitcoin sales.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nMar 7, 2022 • 9 min read\n\nBitcoin prices have traded within a volatile consolidation range this week, opening at weekly low of $37,333, rallying to a high of $45,039, and then giving back the majority of the gains, closing at $39,220. As the global macro and geopolitical stage continues to create uncertainty in markets, Bitcoin bulls attempt to set a price floor. The bulls have been absorbing a modest but persistent sell-side pressure for over two-months now, largely sourced from by short-term holder divestment.\n\nWith prices trading sideways in recent weeks, a relative equilibrium has been established. However, given the limited incoming fresh demand, this delicate balance can be disrupted by any significant degree of seller exhaustion, or conversely a re-invigoration of sellers.\n\nThus the question to be answered is whether the capital support being provided by the bulls will be sufficient to keep the bears at bay. As such, in this edition, we will assess the current on-chain volume space, with a specific focus on flows into exchanges. This aims to best reflect the magnitude of sell-side pressure and investor divestment.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, and Portuguese.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nA Tale of Two Exchanges\n\nMonitoring of exchange activity is a powerful strategy within on-chain analysis, although it does require an appreciation of data mutability (covered here). The tracking of aggregate exchange flows, especially over longer time periods (months), provides useful insight the balance of supply and demand.\n\nTo start, we will note of the following high level nuances for interpreting exchange balance metrics:\n\nBitcoin HODLers (of all wallet sizes) tend to be fairly religious regarding self-custody, and are thus the most likely cohort to withdraw their coins.\nNewer retail level market entrants are the far less likely to withdraw coins, preferring the simplicity of custody solutions, and trading options provided by exchanges.\nInstitutional treasuries are similarly likely to take advantage of exchange custody solutions or similar), preferring the expertise and risk management offered by such firms. These coins are also more likely to be traded via OTC desks and held in specialised multi-signature arrangements.\nWith the proliferation of derivatives markets, Bitcoin units can also be used as collateral, and thus exchange inflows may also be a result of providing additional coin margin.\n\nNote that 3-of-4 of the above characteristics have a skew towards exchange inflows. This is in part what makes the aggregate outflow of 575,876 BTC from exchanges (3.655% of supply) since the March 2020 sell-off so impressive. Note also how a relative equilibrium has been established since September 2021.\n\nLive Chart\n\nDuring the highly volatile macro and geopolitical events of the last few weeks, exchange net-flow volumes are also reasonably stable, despite a slight bias towards inflows this week. Around 1k BTC per day in net inflows deposited to exchanges this week, with Bitfinex and FTX receiving the lions share.\n\nThis magnitude of presumes sell-side supply remains fairly modest, particularly given the global macro context.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOver the last year in particular, exchanges have more-or-less fallen into two dominant camps based on their balance change: those with Net Inflows, and those with Stable Balances to Net Outflows.\n\nSpecifically, Binance, Bittrex, Bitfinex and FTX have seen non-trivial growth in their held Bitcoin reserves. In combination, these exchanges have seen combined BTC inflows of 207k BTC since the end of July 2021, a growth of 24.3%.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe other camp includes the remaining exchanges we monitor, and has seen a collective outflow of 253k BTC since late-July. Of these exchanges, Huobi (purple) represents by far the largest overall decline, having fallen from over 400k BTC in March 2020, to just 12.3k BTC today. More than half of this balance decline has occurred following the Chinese government ban on Bitcoin mining, and further restrictions placed on investor activity in May last year.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFTX and Binance in particular stand-out in this study, having seen extraordinary growth in market share dominance (measured by relative BTC balance held). Note that both Binance and FTX host a diverse range of spot and derivative products, and thus it is likely a reasonable proportion of BTC held is being used as margin collateral.\n\nThe total volume of BTC held by FTX is currently estimated to be 103.2k BTC, which is extraordinary growth from the mere 3k BTC held in March 2020. This represents a balance dominance increase from 0.8% in July 2021 to 4.0% today.\n\nIf we remove the BTC held by FTX from the total exchange balance metric (result in pink), we can see this measure of aggregate exchange balances is probing new multi-year lows, showing the sizeable footprint FTX now has.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nBinance however takes the crown for most impressive growth in market share dominance, rising from a relatively stable 8% BTC balance dominance in 2018-20, to over 22.6% today. The total balance held on Binance has increased by 315k BTC since March 2020, an increase of 120% in just two years.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nAlongside BTC balance growth, both Binance and FTX have seen their dominance over Futures markets more than double since Dec 2020. Binance's share of Future OI has increased from 15% to 30%, whilst FTX has risen from 6.7% to over 14.8% (a 2.2x increase).\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe increase in Futures volume dominance is even more impressive, with Binance now representing half of all traded futures volume. FTX has seen a similarly impressive increase in volume dominance, rising by 2.5x since Dec-2020 to now capture 9.2% of traded futures volume.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOur high level conclusions from this study of exchange activity:\n\nNet inflows remain relatively small given then scale of market uncertainty at present, and overall exchange balances appear to be in equilibrium.\nThere are two cohorts of exchanges with respect to BTC balance change over the last year.\nBinance and FTX represent the stand-out exchanges in market share increase over the last two year, both of which have a corresponding increase in futures market dominance.\nThis suggests a preference of investors to use derivatives to hedge risk, rather than the sale of spot BTC, an observation which corroborates our report from Week 7.\nCharacterising Exchange Inflow Volumes\n\nHaving now explored the relative equilibrium of exchange balances, we can now look to explore the investor profile of coins being sent to exchanges. To start, we will analyse three estimates of investor cost basis (realized prices) to inform our interpretation of sentiment and the likelihood of a sale:\n\nThe Short-Term Holder realized price is currently trading at $46.4k, and thus holds an aggregate unrealized loss of 15%. This metric is a reflection of all coins that were moved within the last 155-days.\nThe HODLer Implied Price is currently at break-even ($39.2k), and reflects an estimate of 'fair value'. It is calculated by weighting the standard realized price by the degree of accumulation and HODLing behaviour.\nThe Realized Price is currently at $24.1k, and is the average price of all coins valued when they were last moved on-chain. Historically, this has been a very sound cycle support level, and suggests that the aggregate market is still holding an unrealized profit of 63% (heavily weighted by longer-term investors with a lower cost basis).\nLive Chart\n\nOne obvious thesis from this is that:\n\nShort-Term Holders (STHs) are the most likely to sell since they are underwater on their position.\nConversely, Long-Term holders (LTHs) are more likely to be in profit, and thus are less likely to sell.\n\nThe next chart shows the shows the degree of profit or loss realized by STHs on coins sent to exchanges. We can see that non-trivial daily losses have been sustained for over two months, equivalent to of around 0.5% of the Market Cap per day. Whilst significant, losses of this magnitude are nowhere near the extreme capitulation levels seen in the 2018 bear market, March 2020, or in May 2021.\n\nThis largely confirms our first observation that STHs are creating sell-side pressure, although it is of much lower magnitude than has been seen in previous bear cycles.\n\nUnreleased Metric from the Glassnode Engine Room\n\nSimilarly, the chart below shows the profit or loss realized by LTHs sending to exchanges. We can see that the degree of spending has been in decline since Jan 2021, which confirms our second observation that LTHs comprise a small portion of sell-side activity. Note that we are yet to see a major LTH capitulation event as was seen at previous cyclical bottoms.\n\nThe historically low magnitude of both STH and LTH losses may be signalling increasing probabilities of aggregate seller exhaustion. However, the risk of a final, and complete capitulation of both STHs and LTHs should remain on the radar, and has numerous historical precedents.\n\nUnreleased Metric from the Glassnode Engine Room\n\nThe proportion of on-chain volume that is in profit is also near historically low levels, reaching 47.5% this week. Flipping this observation around, we can deduce that over half (52.5%) of all transaction volume is currently spent at a loss. For context, final stages of previous bear cycles (marked in red) were punctuated by over 55% of all transfer volume being in loss (capitulation events).\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo close out, we look to the 30-day change in the Realized Cap. This metric indicates the total magnitude of profit/loss across the network, mapped out as a statistical deviation from the long-term average (Z-Score).\n\nWhat we see is that investor losses during this bear market are statistically significant, extending 1 standard deviation below the mean. Realized losses of this magnitude are coincident with all significant bear market lows (local and global) over the last 5-years.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe current drawdown is historically significant across a number of on-chain metrics and measures, despite being shallower (-50%) than past bear markets (-85%). This describes characteristics that are similar to previous late-stage bear market trends. However whilst the degree of on-chain 'panic selling' is significant on a statistical basis, it is notably lower relative to market size.\n\nThe investors who are divesting are preferring to sell coins that are held at a loss, an activity which has been dominated by Short-Term Holders. Meanwhile Long-Term Holder sell-side has continued to decline since Jan 2021 a signal of growing conviction in the face of high macro uncertainty.\n\nWith the introduction of derivative markets, FTX and Binance in particular have seen significant increases in market share. This adds another data-point to the market's utilisation of futures to hedge risk, rather than the sale of spot BTC to reduce exposure.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReleased new metric Supply by TxOut Type.\nCluster labels adjusted following wBTC internal transfers.\nFix applied to NVT Entity-Adjusted variant.\nRelaunched Uncharted Newsletter Edition #10.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

On the flip-side, the cohort of HODLers continue to accumulate, seemingly unfazed by macro and geopolitical risks.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nFeb 28, 2022 • 9 min read\n\nGlobal markets have faced a very sobering week, as armed conflict breaks out between Russia and Ukraine. As a global macro asset, and with markets that never close, the price of Bitcoin was quite volatile in response. This week the market traded down to a low of $34,474, before rapidly recovering to a high of $39,917.\n\nHaving now been in a drawdown from the November ATH for 138-days, the conviction of many Bitcoin investors, mostly those whom bought near the top, has been significantly challenged this week. In this edition, we will analyse what looks like a flush out of top buyers, and draw comparisons between current market structure and the May-July 2021 period.\n\nWhat we will observe is that top buyers have almost completely capitulated now. However, the remaining distribution of holders appear to be of a far higher resolve, arguably reflecting the unwavering conviction of the buyers of last resort: Bitcoin HODLers.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Turkish, French, and Portuguese.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nWe will start this analysis with a deep dive on the URPD metric, which shows the distribution of coin supply at the price it last moved on-chain. What we wish to explore here are the similarities and differences between investor behaviour during this drawdown, to the similar scale one in May-July 2021.\n\nWe will analyse the URPD metric from four dates:\n\n10-May-2021 just before the liquidation cascade sell-off event\n20-July-2021 at the $29k low before the rally to ATH in late 2021\n9-Nov-2021 at the current market all-time-high\n27-Feb-2022 at the time of writing.\n\nStarting with the May-July period, the coin distribution was skewed to be very top-heavy, with a large proportion of the coin supply held between $54k and $60k. Whilst this showed a degree of demand at higher prices, it also made for a fragile market with many 'top buyers' who would be sensitive to any major price correction.\n\nLive Chart (10-5-2021)\n\nWhat eventuated was a major market capitulation. Both spot and derivative markets were flushed of all exuberance, the on-chain activity on the Bitcoin network collapsed, and it can be reasonably argued that this was the start of the present bear market.\n\nDuring this 2.5 month long period of consolidation, a great deal of supply was transferred by top buyers into exchanges for sale. This supply was then gradually soaked up by higher conviction buyers, with the cost basis of these coins becoming more heavily weighted between in the $29k to $40k price range.\n\nThis behaviour describes a broad scale weak hand to strong hand redistribution event.\n\nLive Chart (20-July-2021)\n\nMoving to the present market correction, and we can see a remarkably even distribution of the coin supply was established during the rally from July 2021, into the Nov ATH. This distribution indicates the following:\n\nMany investors who accumulated in the May-July correction took profits on the way back up. This created volume nodes around $35k, $47k and $62k.\nBuyers saw value and entered the market throughout the August to November rally. This is despite on-chain activity indicating that the majority of 'market tourists' had left, and only the HODLers remained.\nLive Chart (9-11-2021)\n\nThis brings us to the present day, where we can see that much of this evenly distributed supply from November remains in place. Despite a 50%+ correction, these investors have not liquidated their positions.\n\nFurthermore, the primary redistribution appears to be coming from investors who bought the $60k+ range around the all-time-high, which has found new owners around the current price range of $35k to $38k.\n\nThis spending behaviour describes a market dominated by price insensitive HODLers, who appear unwilling to liquidate their coins, even if held at a loss. Meanwhile top buyers have been significantly flushed out, and represent a far smaller proportion of the investor cohort when compared to May-July 2021.\n\nLive Chart\nTop Buyers May Have Already Capitulated\n\nThe news events of this week are world changing. If there was to be a time that Bitcoin investors would capitulate, especially those who see it as a risk-on asset, the break out of kinetic war would be a likely catalyst.\n\nHowever, the degree of on-chain capitulation that occurred during this week's sell-off was lacklustre to say the least. In fact it exhibits similar characteristics to the 20-July-2021 sell-off to $29k (Point 3 below) which simply didn't have the bearish follow through to break prices down to new lows.\n\nThis week saw a net realized losses of $713M which is significantly less than the $2.0B+ capitulation events experienced earlier in the correction.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe have also seen a persistent decline in the number of investors depositing to exchanges (pink), falling from 74k /day at the Nov ATH, down to 41k/day today. Meanwhile, exchange withdrawals are holding very steady at around 40k to 48k/day, again indicative of a consistent pool of HODLers withdrawing rain, hail, or shine.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nOf course the number of exchange deposits or withdrawals is only part of the picture, and it is the volume carried by each that helps establish the balance between of supply and demand.\n\nThe chart below shows a 30-day EMA of exchange net flows and we can see that since July, the market has favoured coin withdrawals (red, outflows). The trend in exchange outflows has softened over this time, however we still have not seen inflows anywhere close to that experienced in May-July last year, even with all the macro headwinds that are in play.\n\nThe current market does not appear to have lost confidence in Bitcoin as a macro asset.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also see this in the revived supply metric looking at the volume of coins older than 1yr that were spent this week. If there was widespread loss of conviction amongst the Bitcoin HODLer cohort, we would expect this metric to see a significant uptick.\n\nHowever this has not eventuated yet, and revived supply remains below 5k BTC/day which is fairly typical of previous accumulation periods.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThere is one cohort who have dominated on-chain spending to exchanges over the last few weeks; the investors who bought the dip, only to find out that there were many more dips to come. Investors with coins aged younger than 3months have dominated at loss spending over the last 30-days. The spending of these young coins have realized a collective loss of -0.05% of the market cap per day for the last month, commensurate with bear market lows through the first half of 2018.\n\nWith the exception of June-July last year, widespread market bottoms are usually characterised by a mass exit of both new and old investors, as broad scale fear takes hold.\n\nGiven we have not seen a similar long-term holder capitulation yet, perhaps Bitcoin HODLers are built differently this time? Or, perhaps there is yet another painful dip to come to flush absolutely all remaining sellers out of the market.\n\nThis is an early look at an unreleased chart from the Glassnode Engine Room.\nStrong Hands Keep Stacking\n\nWith top buyers largely flushed out of the network, and evidence it is a HODLer dominated market, we will close out with three charts that help describe what this long-time horizon cohort may be doing.\n\nFirst up is Illiquid Supply, which tracks the volume of coins held in wallets with little to no history of spending. These often represent cold storage and the wallets of HODLers who withdraw religiously whilst undertaking a dollar-cost average style strategy.\n\nAs a proportion of circulating supply, Illiquid Supply has now surpassed the May 2021 peak, reaching 76.3%. This has now returned to the same level as the 2017 market top, reversing a four year long increase in coin wallet liquidity. Note however that both of these instances preceded major sell-off events, an thus it remains to be seen if these coins are truly in cold storage.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTelling a similar story, the Realized Cap HODL wave bands older than 3mths are pushing to new local highs of 72%. This means that 72% of the USD value 'stored in Bitcoin', is held by coins 3mths and older.\n\nThis is typical of bear markets where long-term investors see value and simultaneously slow their spending (as was seen in Revived Supply above). Note that much of this recent uplift is driven by the 3m-6m old age band in orange at the bottom. These are coins that are in approaching or in process of crossing the Short-to-Long-Term Holder boundary of 155-days (~5mths).\n\nLive Chart\n\nAnd finally, to demonstrate just how much coin volume has been absorbed by HODLers over the last 3 months, we look at the coin volume crossing the 3mth+ age threshold over the last 30-days.\n\nAt present, over 335k BTC are maturing to 3mth+ ages per 30-days, which is 12.2x the daily coin issuance to miners. A similar magnitude of HODLing behaviour was observed in mid-2020, and Jun-Sept 2021, both of which preceded powerful upside moves.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe current market is extremely interesting from both an on-chain, and a macro perspective. Given the enormous magnitude of uncertainty and risk that a kinetic conflict introduces, must be prudent with an expectation of further de-risking, investor panic, and capitulation events. So far however, we have not seen a widespread capitulation event, with exception of very short-term holders whom purchased the ATH or premature dips during this drawdown. Keep note that many signals of 'hype demand' remain well below bull market levels (covered last week).\n\nDespite this very uncertain macro and geopolitical backdrop, the behaviour of Bitcoin HODLers maintain a remarkably bullish conviction. Coins continue to be withdrawn from exchanges, are moving into increasingly illiquid wallets, and are maturing into increasingly senior age bands at a high rate. These look like Long-Term Holder coins in the making.\n\nIt is now key to watch in case these coherent trends begin to reverse, which may signal broad-scale loss of confidence. However in lieu of such a reversal, these observations continue to paint a favourable and constructive future for Bitcoin, somewhere over the horizon.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nFix applied to NVT Entity-Adjusted variant.\nRelaunched Uncharted Newsletter Edition #9.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nBitcoin Faces Sell-Side Headwinds\n\nBitcoin bulls face a number of headwinds, ranging from dwindling demand on-chain, to over 4.7M BTC held at an unrealized loss. In this edition, we explore this potential sell-side energy carried by underwater investors.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nFeb 21, 2022 • 8 min read\n\nBitcoin markets have continued to struggle, with prices trading down from the weekly high of $44,659, and closing below the psychological $40k support level at $38,144. Weakness in both Bitcoin, and traditional markets, reflects the persistent risk and uncertainty associated with Fed rate hikes expected in March, fears of conflict in Ukraine, as well as growing civil unrest in Canada and elsewhere.\n\nAs the prevailing downtrend deepens, the probability of a more sustained bear market can also be expected to increase, as recency bias and the magnitude of investor losses weighs on sentiment. The longer that investors are underwater on their position, and the further they fall into an unrealized loss, the more likely those held coins will be spent and sold.\n\nAs such, we will focus this newsletter on the 'potential sell-side energy' that remains within the coin supply, primarily the volume of supply held at an unrealized loss, and whom it is held by.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, and Turkish.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nThe Bear Market Channel\n\nOne of the distinct signals of bearish Bitcoin markets is a lack of on-chain activity. This can be identified using tools such as Active Addresses/Entities as a proxy for users, or via blockspace demand metrics such as Transaction Counts, and On-chain Fees spent as users bid for inclusion in the next block.\n\nThe chart below presents the number of Active Entities using the Bitcoin network over the last 5yrs.\n\nBull markets can be clearly identified as periods of growing demand from users, typically with an increasing number of active entities during each subsequent bullish impulse (net user growth).\nBear markets are characterised as periods of relatively low network activity, and diminished interest from retail, marked out in the red channel below. The lower-bound of this channel has historically increased in near-linear fashion, suggesting that the pool dependable Bitcoin users (the HODLers) is still growing over the long-term.\n\nThis week however the degree of on-chain activity is languishing at the lower-bound of the bear market channel, which can hardly be interpreted as a signal of increased interest and demand for the asset.\n\nLive Chart\n\nSupporting this observation is the 30-day change in non-zero balance addresses. Whilst a relatively crude measure of user-base demand, periods of high demand and supply accumulation are usually accompanied by an increase in UTXO creation, and growth in non-zero address counts (and vice-versa).\n\nWhilst the  macro trend in non-zero balance address creation is upwards, over the last 30-days, there has been a softening of the trend. This is the result of some investors emptying their address balances completely. Over the last month, around 219k addresses (0.54% of the total) have been emptied, which is a metric to watch in case this is the start of a period of net outflows of users from the network (as was seen in May 2021).\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nA probable cause for this spending behaviour is associated with the financial cost, and psychological pain of holding an underwater investment. We can see in the chart below that the proportion of on-chain entities in profit is oscillating between 65.78% and 76.7% of the network.\n\nThe flip side of this observation is that more than a quarter of all network entities are now underwater on their position. Furthermore, approximately 10.9% of the network has a cost basis between $33.5k and $44.6k, with many of them purchasing in recent weeks. If the market fails to establish a sustainable uptrend, these users are statistically the most likely to become yet another a source of sell-side pressure, especially if price trades below their cost basis.\n\nLive Chart\nLong and Short-Term Holder Losses Mount\n\nOne of the primary tools we use to assess the probability of a coin being spent (and assumed sold) is lifespan, defined as the time since the coin was last moved on-chain. On a statistical basis, the longer a coin remains dormant, the more likely it is to remain dormant.\n\nThis leads into our definition of Long-Term (> 155-day, blue) and Short-Term (< 155-day, red) holders, which is a representation of coins that have a low and high probability of being spent and sold, respectively.\n\nUsing these cohorts, we can break down the distribution of prices where each coin in the supply was last moved. We do this to assess price levels associated with a large cluster of investor cost basis. What stands out is the high concentration of supply held by STHs between $42k and $50k.\n\nWith prices currently trading underneath the lower end of this range, and alongside dwindling on-chain activity, the coins held by this price sensitive cohort market represent a likely source of sell-side pressure, unless balanced by an equivalent influx of demand.\n\nNew Content: Short-Term Holder Shake-out\n\nIn case you missed it, our latest video analysis attempts to isolate which on-chain cohorts are the most likely source of sell-side pressure in the current environment. We analyse Short-Term Holders in particular using supply dynamics and spending behaviours.\n\nAs a gauge of just how underwater Short-Term Holders are, we can calculate the STH Realized Price (aggregate cost basis) by dividing price by the STH-MVRV Ratio (result in blue). This indicates that STHs have an average on-chain cost basis of $47.2k, which at the time of writing (BTC price $38.1k) is an average unrealized loss of -19.3%.\n\nFurthermore, the STH realised price is currently trading above the Liveliness Price ($38.6k) which reflects an estimate of 'HODLer Fair Value'. In both the 2013-14, and 2018 bear markets, when STHs hold coins well above this fair value estimate, it has signalled that the bearish trend has some time left in it to reestablish a price floor.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThe STH-NUPL metric presents the magnitude of losses held by these Short-Term holders in proportion to the Bitcoin Market Cap. Here we can see that STHs have been underwater, in aggregate, since 4-Dec-2021. The total unrealized losses held by STHs is currently equal to 17.9% of Bitcoin's Market Cap.\n\nAt the recent price lows of $33.5k, STH-NUPL reached -39.2%, a level of extremely poor supply profitability, and a level that is rarely exceeded outside the deepest of sell-offs during bear markets. STHs have held coins at a loss for over 2 months now, which could be argued to be a sign of resilience, but should equally be considered a probable source of overhead resistance.\n\nLive Chart\n\nLooking at both cohorts, we can see a near even split in supply held at a loss between LTHs and STHs. Note that the supply percentages shown below are in proportion to the total supply that is not held in exchange balances (termed Sovereign Supply).\n\nSTH supply in loss is currently 15.6% of Sovereign Supply (2.56M BTC).\nLTH supply in loss is currently  13.1% of Sovereign Supply (2.14M BTC).\n\nThe total magnitude of coin supply held in an unrealized loss is now higher than it was during the May-July 2021 period, but is only half as severe as the worst phase of the 2018 bear market, and March 2020 flush-out.\n\nNevertheless, with 28.7% of Sovereign Supply currently underwater (4.70M BTC), which again poses headwinds for to bulls to establish a compelling market recovery.\n\nLive Chart\n\nShifting our focus to the Long-Term Holders, we can review the LTH-SOPR metric to assess the profitability of coins that are being spent on-chain by this cohort.\n\nHigher values of LTH-SOPR indicate greater profits realized, typically observed near bull market peaks.\nLower values of LTH-SOPR indicate diminished profitability of spent coins, usually the combined result of bearish price action, and lower aggregate LTH cost basis (155-days ago, the market price was ~$40k)\n\nAt present, LTH-SOPR is returning a relatively low value of 1.46, suggesting that the coins that are being spent by LTHs are realizing a fairly modest 46% profit on aggregate. Historically, declining LTH-SOPR values are characteristic of macro sideways, to bearish market trends.\n\nLive Chart\n\nUsing this concept of LTH-SOPR as a 'realized profit multiple', we can therefore estimate the LTH Spent Price (pink). This model reflects the average price at which today's spent LTH coins, were accumulated in the past.\n\nThis model is currently trading at $28.5k, which is very near the midpoint between the LTH Realized Price (LTH cost basis), and the Liveliness Price (HODLer 'Fair Value'). Once again, this style of behaviour is indicative of a lack of macro-direction in the market, and was seen particularly throughout the 2019-20 bear market.\n\nPerhaps this leaves room for a final capitulation event where LTH Spent Price falls back to the LTH Realized Price. Or perhaps the general trend of LTHs holding their spot coin supply and using derivatives to hedge risk makes for a more constructive bear than we have seen in the past.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nOverall, the Bitcoin market has numerous bearish headwinds in play, ranging from very weak on-chain activity (a proxy for demand), to large volumes of supply held at a loss (potential sell-side). With a total of 4.70M BTC currently underwater, and 54.5% of it held by STHs whom are statistically more likely to spend it, the bulls certainly have their work cut out for them.\n\nHowever, despite the prevailing drawdown that has been in play for over three months, the underlying supply dynamics remain markedly more constructive that previous bears. As was covered in the last three WoC editions (weeks 5, 6 and 7), Bitcoin investors appear far more likely to hold on for dear life (HODL), and use derivatives to hedge risk, rather than selling spot to reduce exposure.\n\nIt looks like a bear market. But do keep in mind, that longer term, the bear authors the bull that follows.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReleased new metrics SegWit Adoption,  Taproot Adoption, and Share of Spent Transaction-Output Types\nReleased Mt.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nInvestors De-Risk Ahead of Hikes\n\nBitcoin investors have de-risked as global macro headwinds increase. In particular, traders eye the proposed Fed rate hikes in March, opting for protective insurance over speculative calls.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nFeb 14, 2022 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market continues to grapple with numerous macro headwinds, from the tightening of Fed policy expected in March, and now fears of a potential conflict escalation in Ukraine. This week has seen Bitcoin derivatives markets pricing in this uncertainty, with a flattening out of the futures term structure curve until March. Futures premiums out to the end of 2022 are notably low, trading at just 6% annualised, and the market is expressing a strong preference for protective put options.\n\nSimultaneously, on-chain supply dynamics are remarkably stable, a likely indication that investors are prepared to ride out whatever storm lies ahead, preferring to utilise derivatives to hedge out risks. Overall, this speaks to the continuing maturation of the Bitcoin market, as liquidity deepens, and more comprehensive risk management instruments become available. This differs greatly in comparison to historical Bitcoin market cycles where de-risking was possible only by the sale of coins in spot markets.\n\nQuite to the contrary, current spot holdings and flows on-chain continue to display to be constructive characteristics, rather than a mass exit driven by fear or panic.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, and Turkish.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nUncertainty Priced in for March Rate Hikes\n\nAs Bitcoin derivative markets mature and liquidity deepens, we can draw increasingly useful information from futures and options pricing. Across all of the exchanges we track, the futures term structure has flattened out through to March, coincident with the expected rate hikes proposed by the Federal Reserve. This speaks to a clear investor uncertainty regarding the wider economic impact of a tighter US dollar, given the preceding decades of loose monetary policy.\n\nFutures out to the end of 2022 are currently trading with a very modest 6% annualized premium, suggesting the market is quite far from anticipating a wild bullish impulse any time soon.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThere has also been a notable de-leveraging across futures markets this week, however not a result of the infamous liquidation cascade that punctuated so many moments in 2021. The primary driver appears to be traders opting to close out their futures positions, rather than a forced sale/bid due to liquidations and volatile pricing. The market appears to be de-risking and curtailing leverage in response to the plethora of macro uncertainties.\n\nTotal futures open interest has now declined from 2.0% to 1.76% of market cap. Relative leverage of this magnitude has shown to be a considerably more stable range for the market throughout 2021, and was last reached after the 4-Dec-21 de-leveraging event.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also see a strong preference for put option protection with the Put/Call open interest ratio continuing to climb. The transition from traders favouring speculative call options, and into protective put options is quite clear following the October and November 2021 ATHs, indicative of a new regime of investor sentiment.\n\nLive Chart\n\nHigher put/call dominance is also apparent when looking at the open interest distribution for the 4-March contract. The market has a clear preference for puts with a strike between $38k and $40k, carrying more than 2.5x the open interest of the highest volume call option strikes, between $48k and $50k.\n\nOverall, the pricing signals available in derivatives markets indicates a preference for protection, conservative leverage, and a cautious approach to storm clouds on the horizon. Based on both futures and options pricing, uncertainty appears to be principally centred around the impact of Fed rate hikes expected in March. Next up, we will review the performance of on-chain metrics to meld these observations with investor sentiment in spot markets.\n\nLive Chart\nSpot Supply Dynamics Remain Stable\n\nAs noted above, investor de-risking in prior Bitcoin market cycles was best expressed by the sale of coins in spot markets, as investors reducing their exposure. In this instance, we would usually expect to see a period of net coin inflows to exchanges, a phenomena that was observed from May to July 2021.\n\nHowever, in the current market, we continue to see net coin outflows at a non-trivial rate. Across all exchanges we track, BTC is flowing out of reserves and into investor wallets at a rate of 42.9k BTC per month. This trend of net outflows has now been sustained for around 3-weeks, supporting the current price bounce from the recent $33.5k lows.\n\nLive Chart\n\nLong-Term Holder (LTH) supply has continued to hold a sideways trend, with a total supply held of around 13.341M BTC. There is almost always a consistent flow of coins maturing from Short into Long-term holder status. As such, this indicates that the degree of LTH spending is approximately equal and opposite to the degree of coin maturation.\n\nSince the October ATH, LTHs have spent only 175k BTC on net, demonstrating a remarkably resilient cohort of hodlers, despite the prevailing macro headwinds.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Short-Term Holder cohort (STHs, coins younger than ~155-days), currently hold 18.85% of the supply that is outside of exchange reserves (note: LTH supply + STH supply + exchange Balance ~ Circulating supply).\n\n7.20% out of this 18.85% has recently returned to an unrealised profit during the price rally above $44k. This indicates that 1.178M BTC were spent (assumed to have changed hands) as prices traded between $33.5k and $44.0k. In other words, 7.2% of the coin supply held outside exchanges has been re-accumulated over the last three weeks, providing an indication of underlying demand in the current price range.\n\nLive Chart\n\nMiners also continue to display an intriguing preference for coin accumulation or distribution. The chart below presents two different cohorts of miners, whom have divergent behaviour in their treatment of mined supply:\n\nBinancePool (blue) has been a strong net accumulator of mined coins since mid-2020, having amassed a reserve of 33.2k BTC. However throughout 2022, miners associated with BinancePool have been spending in semi-regular tranches of between 1.2k and 1.6k BTC.\nAll other miners and pools (orange) have been much heavier distributors throughout 2020-21, with aggregate balances reaching multi-year lows of around 690k BTC in Oct-Nov last year. Countering the recent spends by BinancePool, this miner cohort have added between 5k to 7k BTC to their aggregate reserves in 2022.\n\nOverall, miner balances are climbing in aggregate, however the chart below demonstrates that the majority of this accumulated supply is driven by miners associated with BinancePool.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also investigate large wallet holdings, often referred to as whales, to see if there is a net accumulation or distribution in play. However, it is important to note that interpretation of 'whale holdings' requires a very nuanced analysis approach, and is rarely as straight forward as watching changes in an aggregate wallet cohort.\n\nThe chart below presents two curves, reflecting wallet balances of millions of USD in value:\n\nSupply held by entities with 100-1k BTC (teal)\nSupply held by entities with 1k-10k BTC (dark blue)\n\nWhat we can see is an almost equal and opposite change in total supply held in these two cohorts throughout 2021. As the supply held by 1k-10k cohorts declined by 520k BTC, the supply held by 100-1k cohorts increased by 488k BTC. Finer grained analysis would reveal whether these coins were bought, sold, or simply reconfigured into a greater number of smaller value UTXOs.\n\nIn aggregate however, through the course of 2021-22, this leaves a net of -32k BTC that migrated out of these wallet cohorts. This is arguably a small coin volume when spread over a year long process of redistribution, and also relative to the present monthly rate of exchange outflows (42.9k BTC/mth).\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn summary this week, it appears that investors are deleveraging and utilising derivatives markets to hedge out risk, and buy downside protection, with a keen eye on the Fed rate hikes expected in March. Meanwhile, overall on-chain supply dynamics appear to be in a form of equilibrium. Both Long- and Short-Term holder supplies are range-bound, miner balances are on aggregate flat to slightly higher over the last few weeks, and whale supply (100-10k BTC wallets) have been flat since December.\n\nUnlike previous Bitcoin cycles, the sale of spot holdings does not appear to be the preferred de-risking strategy. This reflects an increasingly mature market, with a growing suite of derivative instruments available for risk managers.\n\nWeekly Feature: New Bitcoin Supply Metrics\n\nAs Bitcoin market dynamics change over time, analysts must pay attention to a growing set of 'locations' where Bitcoin may be locked up, and flow in/out of. The section below introduces a number of new metrics available on Glassnode Studio to track various concentrations of Bitcoin supply.\n\nThere are now three Bitcoin ETFs trading in Canada:\n\nThe Bitcoin Fund QBTC.U (orange)\nPurpose Bitcoin ETF (purple)\nCoinshares BTCQ.U (pink)\n\nCollectively, these ETFs now hold a total of 62,628 BTC, representing 0.33% of the circulating supply, with the Purpose ETF representing 47.6% of the total.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe wrapping of Bitcoin into wBTC for use within the Ethereum ecosystem has been in impressively high demand, having now absorbed 271,167 BTC, over 1.43% of circulating supply. wBTC supply has expanded by 140% since the start of 2021, growing by 158.2k BTC.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFinally, as the long-running Mt Gox rehabilitation proceedings continue, metrics presenting the balance of coins held by the Mt Gox Trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, are now live. After a series of sale tranches in 2017-18, the total balance of coins controlled by the Mt Gox Trustee currently stands at 137,890 BTC, equal to 0.72% of the circulating supply. This metric will respond in the event any of the coins held are spent and moved by the Trustee.\n\nLive Chart\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReleased new metrics SegWit Adoption,  Taproot Adoption, and Share of Spent Transaction-Output Types\nReleased Mt.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nIs a Bitcoin Bottom in?\n\nAs Bitcoin prices bounce from multi-month lows, we investigate the likely driving mechanisms, and evaluate the quality of support provided in the $30k-$40k range.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nFeb 7, 2022 • 9 min read\n\nAfter three months in a persistent downtrend, the Bitcoin market has caught a bid, with the market trading above and holding the psychological $40k level. However, with numerous macro and market headwinds in play, the question is whether this is THE bottom, or just A local bottom within a longer time-frame bear.\n\nIn this week's edition, we will assess the underlying support that established the recent price lows, as well as the various mechanisms that are driving the market higher. Prices have bounced off a number of fundamental levels that have historically signalled undervaluation or a 'fair value' price. We also discuss whether the short squeeze discussed in the previous edition has played out, and the spending patterns of short-term holders in response to market upside.\n\nWe also provide some commentary on the recent spend of 96.4k BTC associated with the Bitfinex hack in 2016, and how this was detected in various on-chain metrics.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, and Turkish.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nFundamental Support\n\nThroughout 2021 and 2022, the $30k to $40k price range has proven to be a sturdy support level for the Bitcoin bulls. In 2021, this range was defended after the 50%+ drawdown in May-July, provided support in the September correction, and has once again been a source of bid support in Jan-Feb this year.\n\nThe URPD metric shows the distribution of realised prices for the current Bitcoin UTXO set. Here we can see that 2.351M BTC (12.41% of supply) have last transacted between $36.2k and $41.2k. Even with these coins being redistributed to lower realised values, the market remains top-heavy, with more than 25% of the circulating supply having last transacted at higher prices.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs the market pushes higher, one mechanism driving it may be the squeezing of late entry shorts as discussed in last week's edition. Inspecting the Long Liquidation Dominance charts shows that shorts have been on the back-foot this week, with a minor skew towards short side liquidations.\n\nHowever, the magnitude of this metric remains fairly lacklustre, indicating that it is unlikely that price upside is being primarily driven by a short squeeze.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis is largely confirmed by the 1-day change in Futures Open Interest, where we have not yet seen the characteristic de-leveraging event, where a large volume of open contracts are forced closed. Futures Open Interest does however remain elevated at around 1.91% of the Bitcoin Market cap (~$15Billion).\n\nThis may indicate the probability of a short squeeze is lower than first estimated, or that such an event remains possible should the market continue higher, reaching clusters of short seller stop-loss/liquidation levels.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nLooking to the spot/onchain markets, we can see that the Bitcoin network saw an impulse of new net entities this week, pushing up to a net growth of 18.5k entities per day. Through 2021, large impulses of net entities have occurred around volatile periods such as bull market corrections in Q1-Q2, and during the 50%+ sell-off in May.\n\nJune to Dec 2021 was a period of quiet accumulation with a stable baseline of 12.5k net entities entering the network per day. As such, the recent spikes in Jan and Feb may suggest a tentative transition out of HODLer dominated accumulation, or at least a renewed interest in Bitcoin after trading down to more attractive entry prices.\n\nLive Chart\nNew Glassnode Content\n\nWe are pleased to release our latest research report and metrics on Segwit adoption by exchanges. In this piece we introduce a new metric called SegWit Utilisation, as well as critically evaluate SegWit adoption rates by the largest consumers of Bitcoin blockspace.\n\nWe have also released three new metrics associated with this research:\n\nSegWit Adoption, Taproot Adoption, and Share of Spent Transaction-Output Types\nExchanges on the Road to SegWit Adoption: on Pioneers, Stragglers and Holdouts\nWe take the recent release of Taproot as opportunity to investigate ways to measure the adoption of SegWit-related Bitcoin improvements in a meaningful way; simultaneously, we put a spotlight on exchanges and their SegWit adoption.\nGlassnode Insights - On-Chain Market Intelligence\nJohannes Hofmann\nShort Term Momentum Swings Upwards\n\nFor the first time since late November, Short-Term holders (STHs) have seen a profitable day, with STH-SOPR breaking above 1.0. This indicates that coins that were spent, and younger than 155-days, realised profits on aggregate this week. This follows more than two months realising losses every day as STHs who bought the top, were shaken out of their coins at lower prices.\n\nA similar STH-SOPR pattern can be seen in two instances since March 2020. After a long period of losses, the market managed to break into a bullish uptrend, with a STH-SOPR retest of 1.0 to confirm. Should we see STH-SOPR break higher again, it indicates renewed profitability and demand inflows are absorbing coins. Conversely, a break back below 1.0 would be a bearish indicator, and suggests there is insufficient demand to support sell-pressure from STHs.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also see a fairly dramatic bullish divergence playing out on the 14-day Market-Realised Gradient (MRG) oscillator. This metric models the degree of momentum in market pricing relative to the natural capital inflows, captured in the Realised cap. General interpretation is as follows:\n\nSuccessive Higher/Lower peaks indicate increasing momentum to the Upside/Downside, respectively.\nBreaks above/below 0 indicate that a new uptrend/downtrend is in play, with an anticipated swing duration of ~14-days.\n\nWhere the market top in Mar-Apr 2021 showed a bearish divergence (declining market momentum with higher highs in price), the current period reflects a bullish divergence. With each new price low set, there is reducing momentum to the downside, and the 14-day MRG has now convincingly broken above 0. The 28-day MRG actually shows similar market structure, providing confluence and magnitude to the argument for at least a local market low being established.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThis upswing follows a fairly persistent three month downtrend, which pushed the monthly return profile for Bitcoin well into negative territory. The chart below shows Bitcoin returns (as %) over a rolling 30-day window, with negative returns of -30% historically signalling oversold conditions. Monthly returns have only been this poor in five periods in the last 5-years:\n\nThe corrections in Jan-Apr 2018 which started the bear market.\nThe November 2018 bear market capitulation event.\nThe March 2020 market wide sell-off as COVID locked down global economies.\nThe May 2021 sell-off and de-leveraging event.\nThe YTD performance in 2022.\nLive Workbench Chart\nEstimates of Bitcoin's Fair Value\n\nThere have been many approaches and models proposed to valuing Bitcoin over the years, and the assessment of any set should be accompanied by confluence between numerous metrics and indicators.\n\nOne of the simplest, but still very powerful tools for this is the Mayer Multiple, calculated as a ratio between price and the 200-day moving average. The 200DMA is widely observed as a long-term bull/bear indicator in technical analysis, and as such steep deviations below it can indicate a degree of undervaluation relative to a long-term mean. The Mayer Multiple traded below 0.8 this week, representing a 20%+ discount relative to the 200DMA. The price level representing a Mayer Multiple of 0.8 is $39.1k, which the market has now reclaimed (calculated as 0.8 x 200DMA).\n\nSimilar to the Monthly Returns metric, previous instances of a Mayer Multiple trading below 0.8 typically correlate with severe drawdowns in bear markets, and particularly during market-wide capitulation events (e.g. Jan 2015, Nov 2018 and Mar 2020).\n\nLive Chart\n\nAnother metric that reflects a 'fair value' is the Realised-to-Liveliness Ratio (RTLR) which is proposed to estimate the 'fair value' of Bitcoin as priced by the HODLer cohort. During periods of heavy coin dormancy, Liveliness declines, and the realised price is thus amplified when Liveliness is placed in the denominator (and vice-versa).\n\nThis metric has provided support in late 2020 prior to the main bull market impulse, and again in June and July 2021. The market traded below this level last week, but has since reclaimed the RTLR level of $39,958, which is reasonably consistent with the support level with a Mayer Multiple of 0.8.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nOn the 2016 Bitfinex Hack Wallet\n\nThis week a number of on-chain metrics detected a very large spend of 94,643 BTC associated with wallets from the 2016 Bitfinex hack, with a market value of $3.67 Billion. Given the large size, both in coin volume, USD value, profit realised, and lifespan destroyed, this makes for an interesting case study in assessing how anomalous on-chain events affect metric interpretation.\n\nWe can see in 5yr+ revived supply that this spend is the largest 5yr+ old spend in history, eclipsing the previous high of 71.825k in Jan 2019 when prices were $3,629.\n\nLive Chart\n\nCoin-days destroyed also spiked to multi-year highs with a total of 195M coin-days destroyed, of which 190M (97%) are associated with the Bitfinex wallets.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs noted above, a declining Liveliness metric indicates that across the entire coin supply, a greater volume of coins are dormant and accumulating lifespan (coin-days), compared to those being spent, destroying coin-days. This is typical of periods of HODLer accumulation, and is often synonymous with bear markets.\n\nLiveliness is in an established downtrend, with the notable exception of a vertical increase this week in response to the Bitfinex spend, which lifted this macro scale metric by 0.38% on the day.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOne lifespan metric that can be deployed to cut through anomalies such as this one, where a small number of wallets spend very large/old coins, is ASOL. Average Spent Output Lifespan measures the average lifespan of spent coins on a per UTXO basis, ignoring coin volume completely (which is measured by CDD and Dormancy for example).\n\nASOL did not respond meaningfully to the Bitfinex wallet and is actually breaking down to lows last visited in June 2021. Uptrends in ASOL are typical when there is widespread distribution by older coins, usually in bull markets. By contrast, downtrends such as the one in play suggest HODLing is the preferred behaviour, which is consistent with the macro scale downtrend in Liveliness.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary\n\n\nAs the Bitcoin prices bounce from multi-month lows, we investigated the potential driving mechanisms, and evaluated the support provided by investors in the $30k-$40k range. The market lows of $33.5k set last week were associated with historical undervaluation across a range of metrics including the Mayer Multiple, RTLR, and the monthly return profile.\n\nThe market remains top-heavy in supply distribution, with over 25% of all BTC holding unrealised losses. However, there is a reasonable degree of momentum behind this rally, with STHs returning to profitability, and the short-range MRG oscillators flipping positive. Key to watch moving forward is whether Long-term holders and older coins take exit liquidity, and whether the rally can be supported by renewed demand which has been lacking in general since the May sell-off.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReleased new metrics SegWit Adoption,  Taproot Adoption, and Share of Spent Transaction-Output Types\nReleased Mt.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nLevered Shorts vs Spot Demand\n\nBitcoin enters its 82nd day of the prevailing drawdown, as derivatives traders bet on further downside. Meanwhile, on-chain demand models suggest a more bullish undertone is in play.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJan 31, 2022 • 9 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has continued to slide lower, reaching $33,424 on Monday, the lowest traded price since July 2021. Prices have now been in an established downtrend for 82-days, and negative sentiment has spiked higher, particularly across derivatives markets. Funding rates for perpetual swaps traded into negative territory, and we have seen a notable reversal in options markets, where put option volumes have increased markedly.\n\nIn our previous newsletter, we examined the prevailing supply dynamics and network profitability, which we argued resembles a classic Bitcoin bear. In this week's edition, we shift our focus to an assessment of demand, in order to capture the other side of the equation. On-chain tools can provide insight into both supply and demand, and with the established macro bearish outlook as a background, we now seek to identify whether the underlying demand profile is sufficient to start establishing a market bottom.\n\nTranslations\n\nThis Week On-chain is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nNegativity Enters Derivative Markets\n\nOver the course of 2021, trading volumes in futures markets have been in macro decline, falling over 50% from $80B/day in March 2021, to under $40B/day in January 2022. As is commonplace during high volatility events, this week's sell-off to $33k was met with a significant uplift in trading volume, hitting just under $60B/day.\n\nBinance remains the dominant venue, hosting the lions share of futures trade volume, representing over 52.5% of all contracts this week.\n\nLive Chart\n\nEven with relatively low trading volumes, futures open interest remains remarkably elevated, particularly for perpetual swaps. As a percentage of the Bitcoin market cap, open interest in perpetual swaps (purple) is hovering around 1.3%, which is historically high, and often as precursor to a deleveraging event.\n\nOpen interest across all futures markets (including perpetual swaps) is elevated at 1.9% of market cap (orange), however this is closer to the middle of the range in typical values. This observation indicates that a great majority of current futures leverage is held by traders of perpetual contracts (heavily concentrated on Binance).\n\nLive Chart\n\nWith this elevated leverage and relevance of perpetual swap markets, we can look to funding rates to get a sense of market bias and direction where leverage is most heavily applied. Funding rates have traded negative for much of January, indicating that a modest short bias exists in perpetual swap markets.\n\nLive Chart\n\nSimilar negativity is seen in options markets, with the Put/Call ratio rising to 59%, a multi-month high. This indicates that traders have shifted their preference away from calls, and towards buying downside insurance, even as the market trades to 6-month lows.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWith this observable shift from long into short bias across derivatives markets, the dominance of futures liquidations has started to creep towards the short side. With high negativity, elevated leverage, and a overall short bias, a reasonable argument could be made for a potential counter-trend short squeeze in the near-term.\n\nLive Chart\nAssessing On-chain Demand\n\nAssessing the demand of the market using on-chain tools is nuanced, and requires an understanding of market participants, and the destinations of spent coin volumes (i.e. in/out of exchanges, in/out of HODLer wallets etc). This week we will focus on demand from on three key areas:\n\nWallet growth and accumulation/distribution trends.\nFlow of funds in/out of exchange reserves.\nNetwork utilisation as a settlement layer to gauge 'fair value'.\n\nFirst, we look at a fairly foundational and simple metric, the number of non-zero wallet balances. Generally speaking, when the Bitcoin network experiences a large scale investor flush out (such as the 2017 blow-off top), investors spend many UTXOs from their wallets, deposit coins to exchanges, whom then consolidate that supply into a small set number of large balance wallets.\n\nSuch a wallet purge is quite obvious following the 2017 top, and a smaller flush out can be seen in May last year. In both instances, the number of non-zero address resumed an uptrend once the dust had settled, usually around the middle phase of the bear market that followed as buyers recommenced accumulation.\n\nThe current upwards trajectory of non-zero wallet counts appears to be largely unaffected by the last three months of depressed prices, sporting similarities to the mini-bear of 2019, and hitting a new ATH of 40.16M addresses.\n\nLive Chart\n\nRetail size wallets, holding < 1BTC (shrimps), also appear unfazed by this correction, with supply held in these wallets continuing to climb. The rate of supply growth for this cohort has seen two macro increases, first after March 2020, and again after May 2021. Given Bitcoin's history as a grassroots phenomena, this speaks to a growing class of 'sat stackers' and HODLers who remain throughout all market conditions.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn order to further classify the coin supply, we use groupings termed Illiquid, Liquid and Highly Liquid supply, based on the spending patterns of wallets (methodology here). When mapped as a proportion of market cap, the percent of Illiquid supply (blue) has now reached 76.2% of circulating, returning to Dec 2017 levels. These coins are held in wallets with little-to-no history of spending, and thus reflect a cohort of wallets that are likely in accumulation mode.\n\nBearish periods (red zones) such as 2018 and May-July 2021 are punctuated by large declines in Illiquid supply. This means an large volume of coins were spent out of cold storage, and must be subsequently absorbed by new buy side demand.\nBullish periods (green zones) such as post-March 2020 typically see Illiquid supply increase, as accumulation takes place, and demand soaks up sold coins.\n\nInterestingly, prices in the current market are declining (bearish), whilst Illiquid supply is in a marked uptick (bullish). This week alone, over 0.27% of the supply (~51k BTC) was moved from a Liquid to Illiquid state. Within a macro bearish backdrop, this does raise the question as to whether a bullish supply divergence, similar to May-July 2021, is in effect.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nExchange balances are one of the larger constituents of the Liquid and Highly Liquid supply metrics, and thus it makes sense to look at flows in and out to validate the observations made above. The exchange net position change is a metric showing this net monthly flow of coins in (green), and out (red) of the exchanges we track.\n\nThis week, we have seen net outflows of a reasonably high magnitude, with rates between 45k and 59k BTC per month. This has confluence with the increase in Illiquid supply (~51k BTC), indicating that some portion of the exchange withdrawn coins may have moved to colder storage.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs a result, total exchange reserves have declined to multi-year lows, reaching 13.27% of the circulating supply. It is important to note that this is very different to the market reaction observed in the May-July 2021 drawdown:\n\nBoth periods experienced over 50% price drawdowns from the ATH.\nMay-July 2021 saw over 164k BTC (0.84% of circulating) in net inflows to exchanges, alongside a decline in Illiquid supply equal to of 1.5% circulating supply.\nThe current drawdown has seen exchange balances decline by 42.9k BTC (0.28% of circulating) since the November ATH, whilst Illiquid supply has increased by 0.86% of circulating supply.\n\nDespite equivalent scale drawdowns, the trends in exchange reserves and coin liquidity are trending in opposite directions. The current environment has a markedly more bullish undertone of supply absorption, and far fewer coins being spent and sold in fear.\n\nLive Chart\nNetwork Utility On the Rise\n\nBitcoin is many things to many people, and one of those things is a settlement layer for value. In theory, the more value Bitcoin settles as a network, the more utility is served, and the higher the network should be valued, and vice-versa.\n\nThe blow-off top in 2017 was marked by an explosion in settlement volumes, peaking above $10B/day. This was quickly followed by an equally incredible 80% decline back to $2B/day, all within just a few months. The mania phase came and went with gusto.\n\nThe market since Oct 2020 has been very different.\n\nDuring both of the aforementioned 50%+ drawdowns, settlement volumes declined significantly from the peaks. However, the floor value has continued to grow, even during bearish trends (red zones). This speaks to a more sustained, and even growing utility of Bitcoin as the market cap, holder base, and value stored increases.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe make-up of these settlement volumes has also seen an undeniable shift since October 2020, away from retail sized transactions (<$100k), and towards high-net-worth and institutional sized values (>$1M).\n\nTransactions $10M+ in size now dominate 45% of settled volume, whilst sizes > $1M dominate over 70% (on an entity-adjusted basis). Large size transactions have sustained this elevated dominance throughout 2021, and have actually peaked higher over the course of this correction.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFinally, we can construct an implied pricing model using the NVT Ratio, which maps network settlement volume (utility), to an implied price (methodology by Willy Woo). The market price is currently trading between the faster 28-day (green) and slower 90-day (pink) NVT price models, arguably putting Bitcoin in a zone of 'fair value' right now.\n\nTaking a ratio of price and the 90-day NVT price gives an 'NVT Premium', which is currently trading at lows that are historically considered undervalued. Previous instances where settlement volumes have been this high relative to the market cap have preceded strong bullish impulses in bear markets, or at macro market bottoms such as Dec 2018, and Mar 2020.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nSummary\n\nIn our previous report, we explored the current supply dynamics, and determined they are characteristic of most historical Bitcoin bear markets. This week we shifted gears to look into the underlying demand side of the equation, which reveals a marked difference between current market structure, and the most recent bearish period in May-July 2021.\n\nWhilst both experienced 50%+ drawdowns in price, the current market appears to have a resilient and persistent class of HODLers, whom appear to be accumulation mode through rain, hail or shine. On-chain settlement volumes are down from the highs, however are increasing relative to market valuation, suggesting Bitcoin is now closer to a 'fair value', than it is to a cycle top.\n\nMeanwhile, derivatives markets appear to be betting on further downside. Within the context of a macro bear, this begs the question; is the market late to hedge out risk, or is it due for an upside correction to shake-out this peak in leveraged negativity?\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nImprovements to exchange FTX wallets.\nAdded FoundryUSAPool, LuxorTech, MaraPool, SBICrypto, TerraPool, ArkPool, UKRPool, SigmaPool and SpiderPool to the list of supported miners.\nImprovements to BinancePool, Poolin, BTC.com and 1THash&58COIN wallets.\nReleased Mt.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nSizing Up a Bitcoin Bear\n\nAs Bitcoin prices are cut in half from the ATH, the market experiences a large onchain capitulation event, with $2.5B in net realised losses. In response we analyse whether a macro bear has taken the reigns.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJan 24, 2022 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has had yet another challenging week, with prices declining from the weekly open of $43,413, down to a new local low of $34,407. This puts the total drawdown relative to the November ATH at 49.9%.\n\nAlongside declining prices, investors have capitulated over $2.5 Billion in net realised value on-chain this week. The lion's share of these losses are attributed to Short-Term Holders whom appear to be taking any opportunity to get their money back.\n\nIn this week's newsletter, we will seek to assess the damage, and establish the likelihood that a prolonged bear market is in play. Defining a Bitcoin bear market is no easy task, and in this edition we attempt to add some colour to the debate using historical investor behaviour, and profitability patterns as our guide.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nSizing up a Bear\n\nAt the weekly low, Bitcoin prices were just shy of being cut in half from the ATH, reaching a total drawdown of 49.9%. This is now the second worst sell-off since the 2018-20 bear market, eclipsed only by July 2021, where the market fell -54% from the highs set in April.\n\nWith the bulls now firmly on the back-foot, such a heavy drawdown is likely to change investor perceptions and sentiment at a macro scale. Drawdowns of this magnitude are markedly higher than the -20% to -40% range seen in the 2017 and 2020-21 bull cycle corrections.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Net Unrealised Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric presents the overall market profitability as a proportion of market cap. NUPL is currently trading at 0.325 which indicates that an equivalent to 32.5% of the Bitcoin market cap is held as an unrealised profit.\n\nThis comes in stark contrast to the much higher profitability values of ~0.75 set in March, and ~0.68 set in October last year. There are a number of indications from this:\n\nConsidering previous cycles, such low profitability is typical in the early to mid phase of a bear market (orange). One could also reasonably argue that a bear market started in May 2021 based on this observation.\nUnlike 2013 and 2017 bull markets, aggregate network profitability actually declined between the ATHs set through Mar-Apr and Oct-Nov tops. This is a result of coins being distributed at the highs, lifting the overall market cost basis, and thus creating a bearish divergence in this indicator.\nLive Chart\n\nAnother measure of network profitability is the MVRV Ratio, presented below as a Z-Score, tracking standard deviations away from the long-term mean. The MVRV Ratio is calculated as the market cap, divided by the realised cap; and is a useful tool for for identifying periods of high, and poor investor profitability.\n\nWith a current MVRV-Z reading of 0.85, the market is well within territory visited in bearish markets, and a bearish divergence is noted, similar to the NUPL metric above. Generally speaking, such low values of MVRV-Z are reached in the following cases:\n\nSteep corrections in bull markets (blue arrows), which are usually followed by a reversal to new highs.\nEarly bear markets after blow-off tops (pink arrows), as the market panics, investors capitulate, and also often precedes a strong relief bounce.\nMid-to-late bear markets (red boxes) where MVRV-Z trades below 0.85, signifying a period of very poor profitability, low sentiment, and sustained investor loses.\n\nBy this metric, the bulls either need to step up in a big way, else the probabilities favour the bears. That said, a relief bounce in the near term is also probable if history is to act as a guide.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA recently developed on-chain tool is the Realised-to-Liveliness Ratio (RTLR) by Dor Shahar, who a modified the Realised Price using Liveliness in the denominator. It can be though of as a 'Hodler fair value' model, and is designed to amplify, or discount the Realised Price as follows:\n\nRTLR will indicate a higher fair value for Bitcoin when HODLers are accumulating and keeping coins dormant (fair value > cost basis).\nRTLR will converge to the Realised Price as more HODLers liquidate and distribute their coins (fair value = cost basis)\n\nIn the chart below, we can see that the market is now trading below the RTLR price of $39.2k, but above the Realised price of $24.2k. Again, this is often observed during early to mid stage bear markets, adding confluence to the observations above.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nAssessing The Damage\n\nWe have now established that numerous signals point to a macro scale bear trend in play. With this as prologue, we now turn to investor spending patterns, where the week was punctuated by investors capitulating significant losses onchain.\n\nThe Net Realised Profit/Loss metric tracks the amount of market wide profit, minus loss realised by on-chain spending. This provides a measure of daily capital flowing in and out of the Bitcoin network.\n\nAs the market traded down to the weekly lows on Saturday, over $2.5 Billion in net losses were realised, with investors spending coins held at a loss. This marks the largest capitulation event of this drawdown, and almost matches the $2.61 Billion net loss from May 2021 (read our analysis of that sell-off here).\n\nLive Chart\n\nOver the last 7-day period, the total sum of realised losses has now exceeded $7.57 Billion, again in a similar ballpark to major capitulation events over the past 12 months. It can be seen in the chart below that large realised loss events typically correlate with local market lows, as investors who bought the recent top capitulate, and stronger hands and traders drive the market into a relief rally.\n\nNote however that the current drawdown has seen sustained and elevated losses since early November, indicating that this correction has been a particularly painful one.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nShort-Term Pain...For Long Term Gain?\n\nLooking at the cross-sections of investors whom realised the majority of these losses, we can determine that it is largely the Short-Term Holder (STH) cohort. Coins are considered to be owned by STHs when they are younger than ~155-days, and are statistically more likely to be spent in the face of volatility.\n\nThe STH-SOPR metric has accelerated downwards this week, after finding resistance at a value of 1.0 throughout this drawdown. Psychologically, this suggests that recent buyers are taking exits at, or below their cost basis to 'get their money back', creating sell-side pressure and resistance. Lower values indicate heavier losses are taken by STHs, who in this instance are disproportionately top buyers.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAssessing the supply dynamics, we can see that Short-Term Holders are currently in possession of approximately 18.3% of the coin supply (excluding coins held by exchanges). The light red area in the chart below represent the proportion that are currently held at a loss, and as of this week, almost the entire STH supply is underwater.\n\nThis yet again creates a psychological barrier whereby the coins that are already the most likely to be spent and sold, are now also holding an unrealised losses, which further increases the chances of a sale.\n\nLive Chart\n\nInterestingly, STH supply remains near multi-year lows, which is indicative of their counter-part, the Long-Term Holders (LTHs), who appear impressively unfazed by such a severe drawdown.\n\nThe proportion of LTH supply has actually returned to a modest uptrend, which indicates a general unwillingness for this cohort to liquidate. Faced with what looks like a bear market, LTH coins are firmly in cold storage, which remains a constructive undertone.\n\nLike STHs, the LTH cohort are not without financial pain, with 6.04% of the 81.7% supply held by LTHs falling into an unrealised loss this week. This is the highest volume of LTH supply held at a loss since the March 2020 sell-off.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAnd finally, to close out our analysis for the week, we highlight  that the total coin volume older than 1yr has been on a remarkable ascent since October. Over 59.3% of the circulating supply has now been dormant for over 1yr, increasing by 5.8% of circulating supply in the last three months.\n\nThese coins reflect those last moved onchain between Oct 2020, and Jan 2021 during the early, and more exciting phase of the bull cycle. Whilst a rising, and large proportion of mature coins is generally considered constructive, it once again bears similarities to a bear market, a time when only the HODLers and patient accumulators remain.\n\nLive Chart\nSummary\n\nBear markets are hard to define in Bitcoin, as the traditional 20% drawdown metric would trigger a bear almost every second Tuesday given the volatility. Thus we look to investor psychology and profitability as a gauge of likely, and actualised sell-side activity.\n\nWhat we identified this week are significant realised losses, a steep drawdown, a return to HODLer led accumulation, and top buyers taking any opportunity to get their money back. If it looks like a bear, and walks like a bear, it could very well be a bear. But as with many things over the last two years...could this time different?\n\nThis is a question we will continue to explore over the coming weeks. See you then.\n\nSurveying the 21-Jan Sell-off\n\nIn this video analysis, we use both on-chain, and off-chain derivatives metrics to identify and explain the mechanics driving recent downside price-action. When markets sell-off, we can use these tools to investigate which cohorts of coin holders are spending, and whether a leverage flush out is occurring in futures markets.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReverse stacking order for mempool metrics\nReleased Mt.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nBulls & Bears Collide\n\nBears are on the hunt for Bitcoin HODLers profits, whilst supply dynamics approach a new equilibrium, and derivative markets remain heated.\n\nPermabull Nino, Glassnode\nJan 17, 2022 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market returned to a more docile state following a fear-fuelled drawdown in Week 2. Investors and traders appear to be digesting the macro possibilities within this new inflationary regime markets have entered, alongside an increasingly hawkish Federal Reserve. This change in tune has rattled the Bitcoin market in the short term, and at risk of taking control over its medium term prospects.\n\nPrice opened the week at $41,718, briefly set new correction lows down to $39,821, before reclaiming the psychologically significant $40k level. The remainder of the week's price action was more buoyant, hitting a high of $44,252.\n\nThis week's newsletter will cover the current uncertainty that overhangs the Bitcoin market, and the psychology of its participants attempting to regain their footing in the following areas:\n\nHODLer profits sitting at key historical levels, and the overall observable investor response\nZoomed out supply dynamics and spending behavior among short-term and long-term holders, and what it indicates about investor sentiment in the medium to long term\nDerivative activity, and what it can imply about shorter term expectations towards Bitcoin price action\nLive Chart\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nHODLers Profits Under Siege\n\nThe Bitcoin price is currently trading down ~35% from the ATH set in November 2021. As the drawdown worsens, an increasingly significant volume of BTC supply has fallen into an unrealized loss. Approximately 5.7 million BTC are now underwater (~30% of circulating supply).\n\nAs the bears apply pressure to the in-profit cohort of holders, Bitcoin bulls are defending a historically significant level of the Percent of Supply in Profit metric. This magnitude of 'top heavy supply' was defended in two instances in the last few years:\n\nMay 2020 - July 2020, the quiet recovery period following the extreme move downwards from Covid-related panic.\nMay 2021 - July 2021, the choppy and accumulative period following a historical deleveraging event.\n\nThe reaction from this level will likely provide insight into the medium term direction of the Bitcoin market. Further weakness may motivate these underwater sellers to finally capitulate, whereas a strong bullish impulse may offer much needed psychological relief, and put more coins back into an unrealized profit.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can establish an appreciation of market-wide psychology by observing who is parting ways with their coins, and why and when these spends are taking place. The Percent of Transfer Volume in Profit chart displays the proportion of coins spent on-chain that were last moved at lower prices, as a gauge for macro fear and greed.\n\nPercent of Transfer Volume in Profit > 65% signals that a large amount of coins are being spent in profit. This historically occurs during bullish impulses, as holders take advantage of market strength.\nPercent of Transfer Volume in Profit < 40% signals that on-chain volumes are dominated by coins acquired at higher prices. This historically occurs in market downtrends and especially capitulation events.\n\nThe sell-off this week saw less than 40% of spent volume in profit, reaching levels that historically coincide with capitulation events. Past instances at this level have preceded a bullish reversal, and a period of general risk-on behaviour.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe low levels of profitable coin spends is also evident in the Realized Profit chart, which shows the profitability of BTC moved, on a USD basis. In-profit holders are displaying a notable unwillingness to spend coins, with consistent Realized Profit values below $1 Billion/day. In the face of tumultuous and unconvincing price action, this signals that this cohort of holders are patiently waiting for higher prices to spend their respective supply.\n\nClimbing realized profits, especially above the $1 Billion level and accompanied by positive price performance, signals demand absorption of coins, and is a metric to watch in the coming weeks.\n\nLive Chart\n\nMeanwhile, Realized Losses remain elevated and trending higher, as underwater holders spend coins that were acquired near the market top through October and November.\n\nOn average, daily Realized Loss values are ~$750 Million/day, behavior that is comparable to the May - July 2021 capitulation lows. The consistency of large loss realization events is indicative of uneasiness within the market, however also reflects an estimate of demand inflows to absorb these spent coins.\n\nSustained periods of large realized loss does put the onus on the bulls to prove sufficient demand support. A macro decline in realized loss values would be a more encouraging signal for the bulls, as it provides an early indication of sell-side exhaustion.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe stalemate at play between price action, Realized Profits, and Realized Losses is visible in the 28-day Market Realized Gradient (MRG), which compares the momentum in Market Cap (speculative value) versus the Realized Cap (real capital inflows).\n\nPositive values signal that a bull trend is in tact, and upwards momentum in spot markets is growing.\nNegative values signal that a bear trend is in play, and momentum favors the bears.\nLarge values signal that Bitcoin is possibly overbought (positive) or oversold (negative), as market valuation deviates from more fundamental capital inflows or outflows, respectively.\n\nThe MRG trend and values indicate that current market pricing is nearing a point of equilibrium with capital inflows, with a month's long bullish divergence developing. A firm break above zero would signal a bullish reversal is in play, whilst a break down would suggest momentum is accelerating to the downside.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nCohorts and Psychology\n\nWe can also analyse the psychology and spending behaviour of both Short-Term Holders (STH) and Long-Term Holders (LTH) by looking at changes in their respective Realized Caps and supply dynamics.\n\nThe following metric is calculated as the difference between the daily change of LTH and STH realized caps. Interpretation is as follows:\n\nNegative Values (red) signal that the STH Realized Cap is increasing more on a daily basis than the LTH Realized Cap. This occurs during bull runs when long term holders distribute supply into new holders.\nPositive Values (green) signal that the LTH Realized Cap is increasing more on a daily basis than the STH Realized Cap, which occurs during bearish accumulation markets as STH activity decreases, and unspent coins mature into the LTH cohort.\n\nValues currently sit near zero with a general trend to the upside, indicative of a softening of distribution by LTHs, the market reaching a new equilibrium, and a potential reversal into accumulation. Note however, that the process of establishing similar market equilibrium and possible macro bottoms has historically taken several months to resolve.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThe modest distribution of coins from LTHs to STHs is reflected in the Total Supply Held metric, as the net volume of coins held by the STH cohort has increased in recent months.\n\nThe supply held by this cohort sits at ~3 Million BTC, a relative historical low, and a level that signifies a transition into a HODLer dominated market. This has been in effect since the May 2021 deleveraging event. Low STH supply levels are typical of bearish trends, as old coins remain dormant, and younger coins are slowly accumulated by high conviction buyers.\n\nLive Chart\n\nNext we turn to the Realized Cap HODL Waves, which reflects the breakdown of the Realized Cap by coin age, and cost basis. The chart below has been filtered for coins younger than 3 months to further highlight the forces at play within the shorter term holder cohort.\n\nGenerally speaking, lower values in this metric speak to a bearish trend where old coins are dormant, and young coins are gradually accumulated and taken off market.\n\nAt present, around 40% of the Realized Cap is held in coins under 3mths old, owned by buyers entering near the market top, or during the present correction. The 1-3m band is expanding and a constructive view would see these coins continue to mature into the 3m+ band, creating a net decline in young coins. A more bearish observation would be if older coins start being spent, causing these bands to swell, and signifying an additional influx of liquid supply that must be absorbed.\n\nLive Chart\nDerivatives Fireworks on the Horizon\n\nAmidst downwards pressure in Bitcoin holder profitability but yet favorable medium to long term supply dynamics, futures markets remain a powder keg for short term volatility with Perpetual Futures Open Interest at ~250k BTC - a historically elevated level.\n\nSince April 2021, this has paired with large pivots in price action as the risk for a short or long squeeze increases, resolved in market wide deleveraging events.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAlongside high open interest, funding rates this week moved into negative territory, indicating that shorts were increasingly hungry for leverage. As perpetual swap markets were pushed below spot prices, it does add further bias towards a potential oversupply of short positions in close proximity to the current price.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn addition to large outstanding open interest, and negative funding rates, trading volume continues to drip lower, currently around $30B per day. This is coincident with levels in December 2020, and reflects a marked reduction from the 2021 bull market highs, hitting well above $70B/day. Should a deleveraging event occur, thinner trading volumes may accentuate the impact.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs Open Interest continues charging for a big move, funding rates drop, and futures volumes contract, Crypto-Margined Open Interest continues its march downwards versus Cash-Margined Open Interest.\n\nWith only 40% of Open Interest sitting in Crypto-Margined products and in a convincing downtrend since May 2021, Cash-Margined Futures data becomes increasingly higher signal and worthy of more market participants' attention. Note that this trend is primarily driven by a relative reduction in crypto-margin on Binance, Bybit, Huobi and OKEx exchanges.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn summary, there is evidence that the market is reaching some form of price and momentum equilibrium, within what is a broader bearish market structure. Bitcoin bears certainly have the upper hand, however modest bullish divergences are appearing across a number of on-chain metrics and indicators. Coupled with elevated future open interest, and a bias that appears to be a short heavy market, a risk of a deleveraging to the upside remains on the table.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nReverse stacking order for mempool metrics\nRelaunched the Uncharted Newsletter Edition #7 as a Newsletter that will be released for our Professional members moving forwards.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nThis Newsletter is now being translated into Spanish, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nExtreme Leverage at Extreme Depths\n\nWith onchain indicators hitting significantly oversold conditions, Bitcoin futures markets see all-time-high leverage, with increased chances of volatility, and a short squeeze bias.\n\nTXMC, Glassnode\nJan 10, 2022 • 9 min read\n\nBitcoin investors were faced with six consecutive red daily candles this week, accompanied by a broader market sell-off following increased concerns of hawkish policy from the Federal Reserve. Following the release of the December's Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes early in the week, markets reacted to notes related to an accelerated pace of tapering, rate hikes, and of potential quantitative tightening to lighten the central bank's balance sheet.\n\nAfter opening at $47,875, Bitcoin led global declines, trading down as much as -15% year-to-date. Prices have since closed the first full week of 2022 at $40,672, putting the bulls on the back-foot to start the year. In this week's newsletter, we will unpack a number of concepts underlying the reaction of market participants including:\n\nThe climate of older coin spending on-chain,\nIncreasingly elevated levels of Open Interest in futures markets,\nThe potential of a near-term short squeeze developing, as prices trade lower, and bear conviction chases the market down.\nLive Chart\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nOnly The HODLers Remain\n\nA phase of heavy loss realization by top buyers has followed the December 4 flush-out, as we first reported in our Week 50 2021 newsletter. In the weeks since, onchain behavior has been more heavily dominated by the HODLer class, with little activity by newer market entrants.\n\nOne way to see this dynamic is through Hodler Net Position Change, which is the rolling 30-day change in coin maturation. As units of BTC age and mature in investor wallets, they accrue Coin Days, which are 'destroyed' upon spending and help to produce various lifespan metrics.\n\nPositive (green) values mean coins are ageing and maturing at a higher rate than spending. This is typically in bearish market conditions absent retail interest as long-term accumulation takes place by high conviction buyers.\nNegative (red) values occur when elevated rates of spending, particularly by older coins, outpace the present accumulation behavior. This is frequently observed in the heights of bull markets and moments of total capitulation, when older hands are more likely to relinquish their holdings.\n\nFollowing a brief period of net spending after the early November price peak, maturation has again taken the mantle as price declines. It speaks to a trend typically seen when retail/tourists have left the market, HODLers remain, and generally more bearish forward price expectations.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAnother method for measuring spending velocity is via the Value Days Destroyed Multiple (VDD), which compares the monthly sum value of coin destruction to the yearly average.\n\nHigh VDD Multiple values signify elevated coin destruction behavior relative to the past year. This historically marks periods of peak market liquidity, large supply turnover, and rising prices.\nLow VDD Multiple values demonstrate a quiet HODLer market with calm relative coin destruction. These moments can stretch for long periods and often occupy cyclical lows.\n\nUsing the Value Days Destroyed perspective of activity, the October and November rallies saw a very mild level of spending compared to the long-term average. This is in some ways influenced by the historically high VDD values reached in early 2021, but still shows the value of spending at the recent all-time high was relatively low.\n\nThis again paints a picture of a HODLer dominated market, and low relative retail interest.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nRounding out our assessment of spending behavior is Entity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow, which compares the Bitcoin market cap (asset valuation) to the annualized dollar value of coin Dormancy (spending motive). Dormancy is the average age (in days) of spent coins per unit of BTC, which is akin to an Average Spent Output Lifespan weighted by volume.\n\nHigh values of Dormancy Flow means network value is high relative to the yearly value of realized Dormancy in USD. The interpretation is that the bull market is in \"healthy\" conditions (spending in concert with demand valuation).\nLow Dormancy Flow values indicate moments where market cap is undervalued relative to the yearly sum of realized Dormancy, indicating moments where Bitcoin is a value price.\n\nEntity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow recently bottomed out, showing a full reset of the metric. These events historically print at cyclical bottoms, and confluence with Hodler Net Position Change and the VDD Multiple hint at a potential floor of spending in the near-term, barring new surprises.\n\nWith the above three charts in tow, we can largely identify market conditions typically seen in the late stages of a macro bearish trend, often around capitulation style events. It remains to be seen whether there is more pain to the downside, perhaps in response to macro/monetary headwinds, or whether the majority of the damage has already been done and a bullish relief rally is due.\n\nLive Chart\nFutures Markets See New Highs in Open Interest\n\nWhile on-chain has stayed quiet, the leverage in Bitcoin derivatives market has been growing at an aggressive pace This speaks to an outsized interest in Bitcoin price action as a speculative bet, rather than the relatively tepid demand for Bitcoin in spot markets.\n\nLeading our assessment of derivatives is the growth of Futures Perpetual Open Interest, which is the sum value of all open contracts in the continuous contracts market. Shown here in BTC terms, Perpetual Open Interest has reached new all-time highs of 264k BTC in the face of recent price declines, rising +42% since December 4 and surpassing the previous high of 258k BTC set on November 26.\n\nWith the first principles understanding that price declines will inherently close out long traders, a growth in Open Interest in recent days hints at short traders layering on bets into market weakness.\n\nLive Chart\n\nLeading the rapid growth of futures speculation are users on Binance, far and away the largest Bitcoin futures exchange by volume and size. Since May 2021, Binance has enjoyed the lion's share of Futures Open Interest among all exchanges, with a notable increase in market share during recent weeks. Since the dramatic purge on December 4th, Binance has absorbed 9.4% of Bitcoin's Futures Open Interest, and now dominates with a 30% market share.\n\nThe second largest exchange by Open Interest market share is FTX with 19%, surpassing the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). CME had seen a jump in market dominance in October at the launch of the $BITO ETF, but is now the third largest at 15% of Futures Open Interest.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThe dramatic leap in Futures Open Interest can be viewed in another way: representing itself as a leverage ratio against the Market Cap. Typically, periods where Futures Open Interest exceeds >= 2% of Market Cap are short-lived, and tend to end with a dramatic flush of margin.\n\nDe-leveraging events can occur in either direction, and at times have triggered despite an Open Interest leverage ratio below 2%, like on September 7 when El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender. The combination of elevated Open Interest plus a big news event catalyzed a volatile move down.\n\nHowever, each instance where leverage exceeded 2% in the past year ended with a swift liquidation of contracts. At time of writing, Futures Open Interest Leverage Ratio is at 1.98% so there exists a non-trivial risk of high volatility in the short term.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nShort-Term Squeeze of Shorts?\n\nA byproduct of consistent downtrends in price are the liquidation of confident long traders trying to catch a falling knife. A great way to view the trend of liquidations is via the dominance oscillator between long and short liquidations.\n\nSince November, Bitcoin futures has been in a regime of long liquidation dominance, where traders betting on \"Number Go Up\" are consistently on the losing side. This value recently spiked to a local high of 69%, its highest value since the May 2021 crash.\n\nFactoring in this observation with the aforementioned rise of Open Interest into declining price, and the probability of a local reversal is increasing. Short traders, who have not been punished for taking on increasing risk, may find themselves candidates for a near-term squeeze.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs the volume of open contracts in futures rise to new highs, the daily sum of traded volume in futures has been trending in the opposite direction. Large price movements result in contracts changing hands and stop losses being triggered. In sideways price action, traders get away with not having to close their positions, allowing volumes to decline in periods of consolidation while Open Interest can remain high.\n\nFutures Volume saw its zenith in the first half of 2021, where daily trading exceeded $75 billion/day for weeks at a time. Following the market decline of 50% into July, the October rally to all-time highs was supported by volume back up around $65 billion/day.\n\nIn the current environment however, the 14-day average of daily Futures Volume is around $38 billion/day, the same level it was in the depths of the July lows. Low trading volumes can however create environments of reduced market depth, and limited resistance against rapid price moves. Should a deleveraging event follow, in a low liquidity environment, the magnitude of the price move may well be greatly amplified.\n\nLive Chart\n\nRounding out our look at derivatives is Options Open Interest. Coming into December, all eyes were on the end-of-year strike on December 31, following months of buildup to the tune of more than $11 billion in contracts. Many of these contracts were dominated by bulls, with a particular emphasis on Bitcoin prices exceeding $100k.\n\nBy January 1, Options Open Interest was down to $6.2 billion from a December 31 value of $11.2 billion, a haircut of -45% ($5B). The end-of-year strike was the largest of 2021 in percentage closures, but only the second in total dollars. The March 26 strike saw a record $5.3 billion closed at expiration, a reduction of -36%.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn summary, the current Bitcoin market structure can be best described as having:\n\nTepid demand for spot, with the majority of onchain metrics describing a dominance of HODLers in accumulation, typical of bearish markets with low retail/tourist interest.\nDerivatives market leverage is at high risk levels around 2% of the market cap. This is strongly lead by Binance markets, and open interest has increased as prices decline.\nAn elevated risk of a deleveraging exists, coupled with low trading volumes, and an elevated probability of short-dominance in futures markets.\n\nAlongside very oversold indicators in onchain spending activity, this suggests a short squeeze is actually a reasonably likely near-term resolution for the market. Whether it can overcome macro headwinds, and reestablish a convincing uptrend will be a focus for upcoming newsletters.\n\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nAdded Put/Call Ratio metrics: Options Open Interest Put/Call Ratio, and Options Volume Put/Call Ratio\nAdded FTX to Bitcoin exchange metrics.\nImprovements to Binance exchange wallets.\nNew navigation tool using cmd+k shortcut in Studio.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nNew Year Opens Sideways\n\nBitcoin has opened the new year quietly, with lacklustre demand for blockspace, despite bullish undertones in macro supply dynamics.\n\nCheckmate\nJan 3, 2022 • 8 min read\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter (Week 1, 2022)\n\nHappy New Year to all of our readers, the Glassnode Team hopes you had a safe and happy break over the holiday season. Also, Happy Birthday to Bitcoin. Thirteen years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first Bitcoin block, with the following message encoded into the coinbase transaction as a timestamp:\n\nThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\n\nAs 2021 wound down, so too did activity in the Bitcoin market, with trading volumes softening, and prices trading more or less sideways. Price has continued to trade in the same range since late November, bouncing between a high of $51,654, and a low of $46,197 this week.\n\nAcross many on-chain metrics, there is a general lack of activity, despite a modestly bullish undertone in supply dynamics. Coins continue to migrate to increasingly illiquid, and dormant wallets, whilst investor profitability and cyclical metrics paint a more bearish picture. With a balance of both bull and bear signals at hand, our expectations into the start of 2022 are likely continued sideways consolidation.\n\nThe Week Onchain Dashboard\n\nThe Week Onchain Newsletter has a live dashboard with all featured charts available here. This dashboard and all covered metrics are explored further in our Video Report which is released on Tuesdays each week. Visit and subscribe to our Youtube Channel, and visit our Video Portal for more video content and metric tutorials.\n\nOnchain Activity Remains Lacklustre\n\nThe first suite of metrics we will asses in this newsletter are associated with activity occurring onchain. Generally speaking, bullish momentum is usually accompanied by increased demand for blockspace, as coins are purchased, sold, and transferred to new owners. Conversely, bearish trends typically see fewer new wallets, reduced transaction demand, and lower network utilisation.\n\nThe number of wallet addresses with a non-zero balance is a metric that can be used to assess the longer-term demand for Bitcoin. Over the last year, a net total of 7.462M non-zero balance wallets have been added to the network a 23.2% YoY growth. 1.415M of these were added since the October ATH, 18.9% of the yearly total.\n\nThe current ATH of 39.6M of non-zero addresses is 40% higher than the peak set at the end of the 2017 bull market, indicating that user-base growth has been sustained over the last five years.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWith respect to daily activity, we can see that the number of active onchain entities has finally managed to break above 275k/day. The chart below highlights in red an observable and rising 'bear market channel'. This shows that during periods of depressed prices, and lower relative interest, there remains a persistent growth in network users.\n\nBoth 2017 and 2020-21 bull markets stand out as having markedly more onchain activity relative to this channel. However, the current regime appears to more closely resemble the 'mini-bull' that occurred from April to August 2019. These two periods are similar in that they followed a deep correction and broad capitulation event, but the subsequent rallies could not generate sufficient momentum for a full scale bull market.\n\nThe rally in 2019 eventually culminated into a nine month long sideways-to-down trading range, until the final capitulation occurred in March 2020.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTransaction counts paint a similar picture, where the bull markets of 2017 and 2020-21 stand out clearly, hitting over 300k transactions per day at the peaks. Again similarities can be found between April-August 2019 and the current market since September 2021. In both cases, an initial burst of activity supported rallying prices, but failed to sustain any meaningful momentum, with both transaction counts and prices rolling over.\n\nUntil there is further expansion in demand for Bitcoin blockspace, it can be reasonably expected that price action will be somewhat uneventful, and likely sideways at a macro scale.\n\nIt is worth noting the underlying differences in market structures between the 2019 and 2021-22 periods. The Apr-Aug 2019 rally was largely associated with heavy spot BTC demand due to the PlusToken ponzi scheme, coupled with multiple short squeezes as trades faded the move in futures markets. The current market is best described as strong rally off the July and September lows following heavy accumulation. This rally was sold into after a very strong October, as both macroeconomic uncertainty and inflation concerns crept into markets, and trading firms sought to lock in end of year profits.\n\nLive Chart\nUnderlying Supply Remains Constructive\n\nOne of the hallmarks of bearish markets is actually a constructive undertone in supply dynamics. Whilst the onchain activity above points to a fairly anaemic demand from retail and market tourists, coin dormancy remains impressive, and signs of smarter, more patient money accumulating remain in tact.\n\nDecember 2020 was the launching point for very strong price performance in Q1 2021, as Bitcoin broke the previous cycle $20k ATH, and pushed on reach over $64k in April.\n\nIf we look at the supply last active 1y+ metric, we can see that a great proportion of coins accumulated in late 2020 remain unspent to this day. Since October 2021, over 682k BTC have migrated into the 1yr+ age band, representing 3.3% of the circulating coin supply. Over 57% of the coin supply is now older than 1yr, equivalent to the 51.5% seen at the time of the April 2019 bullish impulse.\n\nGiven how volatile 2021 was, seeing such an acceleration and large proportion of coins held throughout is quite remarkable.\n\nLive Chart\n\nLong-Term Holder (LTH) supply has also plateaued after a very modest period of distribution following the twin ATHs in October and November. This signifies that LTHs have slowed their spending, and are more likely to be HODLers, or even buyers at these prices. This provides another constructive view of market conviction.\n\nLTHs have spent around 150k BTC since October which is just 1.11% of their total held balance. The slow-down in spending is notable given the sharp and sustained correction during this time. Note that this also follows a massive accumulation phase in 2021, where on net, over 2.42M BTC migrated to LTH wallets after March, a balance growth of 22.1%.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also assess coin liquidity as a more immediate measure of current coin supply dynamics, such as whether the market is in accumulation (more illiquid) or distribution (more liquid).\n\nWhere the Supply Last Active, and Long-Term Holder Supply metrics use time as the primary input (coin-age, or lifespan), our Liquid and Illiquid metrics uses wallet spending heuristics (see our methodology here). When a coin is moved to a wallet with no history of spending, it will be classified as illiquid (eg. a HODLer executing a dollar cost averaging strategy). Conversely, a wallet that spends very regularly (eg. day-trader or an exchange hot wallet) will be classified as either Liquid or Highly Liquid.\n\nWe can see below that over the final months of 2021, even as prices corrected, there has been an acceleration of coins from Liquid, into Illiquid wallets. Through December, coins moved to increasingly illiquid wallets at a rate of between 50k and 100k BTC/month reflecting a higher likelihood of broader accumulation.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOn net, we can see that Illiquid supply (blue) has accelerated higher, at the expense of the combined Liquid and Highly Liquid supply (pink). Illiquid coins now represent 76% of the total supply, and can be seen to have a visible correlation with price. The current conditions do speak to a divergence between what appears to be constructive onchain supply dynamics, compared to bearish-to-neutral price action.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nLastly on the longer-term macro trends, we can see confluence within the Liveliness metric. Liveliness reflects the relative growth of coin-day creation, and coin-days destroyed in the circulating coin supply. Where more coin-days are created, there is more dormancy and HODLing, and Liveliness will trend lower (blue). Conversely, distribution, particularly by older hands, will see more coin-days destroyed than created and Liveliness will trend higher (pink).\n\nLiveliness appears to be in a strong downtrend even as prices correct. This is typical of bearish markets and periods of accumulation, which further adds to the assessment of bearish with bullish undertones.\n\nLive Chart\nShort Term Holder Pain\n\nWhilst supply dynamics for the more patient smart money appear constructive, there remains a large sector of the market whom are currently underwater on their holdings. Whilst Long-Term Holders appear to have growing conviction, prices are trading below the onchain cost basis of their counterparts, the Short-Term Holders. These are the most likely coins to create sell-side pressure and weigh on a market recovery.\n\nThe Realised Price is a metric that values each coin at the time when it was last spent onchain, reflecting the 'valued stored' in Bitcoin, and an estimate of cost basis. The chart below shows the realised price for three cohorts:\n\nShort-Term Holders (pink): currently trading at $51.4k, meaning this cohort on aggregate is underwater on their investment, and are the most likely to create sell-side resistance.\nAggregate Market (orange): The realised price for the whole market is currently trading at $24.4k. Generally, the Realised Price provides reliable price support and bear market floors, although it is obviously not ideal to see prices reach this level.\nLong-Term Holders (blue): currently trading at $17.7k, after a steep rise as coins accumulated in H1 2021 at higher prices remain unspent. This metric can be considered a visual observation of LTHs valuing Bitcoin at a higher floor value over time.\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nFor the Short-Term Holder cohort, the STH-MVRV metric shows the magnitude of current underwater pain relative to past bearish periods. The STH-MVRV is currently trading below 1.0, an event which unfortunately has very few periods since 2017 of being a short lived event. The bearish periods in 2018, 2019 and mid-2021 all saw STHs persistently underwater, with STH-MVRV values of 1 acting as resistance.\n\nPsychologically, this represents new buyers 'getting their money back', which puts $51.4k as a key level to watch.\n\nLive Chart\nProduct Updates\n\nAll product updates, improvements and manual updates to metrics and data are recorded in our changelog for your reference.\n\nGlassnode System Status now available.\nAdded suite of Mempool metrics for Transactions, Size, Cohorts, Volumes, and Fees\nAdded FTX to Bitcoin exchange metrics.\nImprovements to Binance exchange wallets.\nNew navigation tool using cmd+k shortcut in Studio.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week Onchain (Week 52, 2021)\n\nBitcoin closes the year up 78%, having experienced a tumultuous, and volatile 2021. We provide a macro review of 2021 across the onchain, exchange, derivatives, and mining markets.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nDec 27, 2021 • 7 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has traded only slightly higher over the end of year holiday season. The week opened at the consolidation low of $45,601, before rallying to local highs, hitting $51,773.\n\nFor our final newsletter of the year, we will provide a brief 2021 review of some year-to-date changes across both on-chain, exchange, derivatives, and mining datasets. When looking back at 2021, it interestingly appears to be a year best described as a macro, high time-frame consolidation, albeit a volatile one. The year-to-date summary for Bitcoin is:\n\nPrices are up 78.5% from 1-Jan with a current drawdown of 24.4% from 10-Nov ATH.\nThe total Supply currently held at a loss is 3.480M BTC, equivalent to 18.34% of circulating supply.\nExchange balances saw a net yearly outflow of 67.8k BTC, a decline of just 2.5%.\nLong-Term Holders added 1.846M BTC to their holdings, whilst Short-Term Holder supply declined by 1.428M BTC.\nFutures Open Interest almost doubled, increasing by $9.57B (97%) whilst futures trading volume actually declined by 16% to $36.7B/day.\nMining hash-rate has finished 2021 up 27% on the year, after recovering entirely from the great migration where around 53% of miners were shut-off almost overnight.\nMeanwhile, aggregate miner revenue is up 58% YTD, and up over 440% since in the halving event in May 2020.\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nA Brief Review of Bitcoin in 2021\n\nAs the recent correction from the ATH progressed lower, it put an increasingly large proportion of supply into an unrealised loss. Coins have been spent and redistributed through this time, which reshuffles the UTXO realised price distribution (URPD). At the time of writing, approximately 3.7M BTC, representing 19.5% of the supply are underwater.\n\nOn a more constructive note, a reasonably large volume cluster has been established in this weeks price range, equivalent to 2.214M BTC (11.7% of supply). This indicates that a non-trivial degree of demand has been mobilsed during the consolidation, with a large proportion of coins changing hands between $45k and $50k.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs price rallies to the top end of the consolidation range, we can see the percent of coins in an unrealised profit increased by 10.34%. We can use this to estimate an upper bound on the accumulation that has occurred lately (upper bound since some portion of these coins are likely held from previous instances where price was in this range).\n\nSimilar events of large increases (blue), or decreases (pink) in profitable supply are highlighted below, which typically follow periods of relatively heavy redistribution amongst the coin supply.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWith respect to on-chain cohorts, there has been a noticeable redistribution in coin supply from Short-Term Holders, to Long-Term Holders. At the time of writing:\n\nLong-Term Holders added 1.846M BTC to their holdings, bringing their total stack to 13.33M BTC. This reflects an increase of 16% over the year.\nShort-Term Holder supply has declined by 1.428M BTC, with this cohort currently holding 3.01M BTC. This reflects a decline of 32% on the year.\nSovereign Supply, defined as all coins held outside exchange reserves, is currently at an all-time-high of 13.34M BTC.\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nAs a proportion of Sovereign Supply, Long-Term Holders have seen their ownership stake increase by 4.8% to reach 74.8% of sovereign supply. To close out the year, LTHs now own 74.8% of all coins outside of exchange reserves, whilst STHs ownership has declined from 28.0% in Jan, to 25.2% today.\n\nThis modest transfer of wealth from Short-Term, to Long-Term Holders, despite multiple price ATHs, suggests that 2021 is best described as a macro consolidation, and a period of modest accumulation. Such on-chain behaviour is more typically observed during Bitcoin bear markets, which in hindsight are effectively lengthy periods of coin redistribution from weaker hands, to those with stronger, and longer-term conviction.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe counterpart to Sovereign Supply, is Exchange Balances, which impressively have seen very little net change over the course of the year. Exchange reserves have declined from 2.623M BTC at the start of the year, to 2.560M BTC. This is a net decline of 67.8k BTC, a reduction of just 2.5% from the opening balance. The chart of coins held in exchanges shows a general oscillation over time, with net inflows from May to July, and net outflows otherwise.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can see this behaviour more clearly in the Net Volume in/out of exchanges, which has spent 2021 oscillating between ±5k BTC. In fact over the course of the last week, we have seen another reversal from net exchange outflows, back to net exchange inflows. In the immediate term, this is something to keep an eye on to see if the trend softens, or strengthens as we head into the new year.\n\nLive Chart\n\nNext we will look into the very intriguing YTD changes occurring in futures markets. Total open interest in futures has almost doubled this year, rising by $9.57B (97%) to a total of $18.87B. This week alone has seen an increase of some $2.5B in open interest, primarily led by traders on Binance.\n\nWhilst futures open interest is still some way off all-time-highs, rapid increases in leverage can indicate a clustering of stop-losses and liquidation levels in close proximity to the current price. This adds higher probabilities to a potential short, or long squeeze in the more immediate term.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAlongside an elevated possibility of a leverage squeeze, we also have a general decline in trading volume. Quieter trading activity is typical towards years end, however on a 7-day average basis, futures market volumes have seen a YTD decline of 16%. Thinner volume, and rising open interest (in a concentrated exchange) is a combination that can be favourable to at least a localised leverage squeeze over the coming weeks.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAnd finally, we look to the mining industry to close out our review. The mining market has experienced a truly unbelievable shake-up in 2021. An estimated 53% of the industry was banned from the once dominant Chinese jurisdiction in May, and forced to relocate almost overnight.\n\nHash-rate started 2021 at around 143 EH/s, and increased to what was then an ATH of 180 EH/s in mid-May. This was followed by a precipitous decline of 53%, as miners in China were forced to cease operations, and relocate, or redistribute their hardware to new jurisdictions. Incredibly, the mining market has completely recovered from this enormous shift, with hash-rate pushing to new ATHs at 182 EH/s, closing out the year 27% higher.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe success of this transition in the mining market is driven by the free-market incentive of miner revenue, offered by the Bitcoin protocol as a  reward for solving blocks. Some key statistics relating to the aggregate mining revenue (USD denominated, fees plus block subsidy):\n\n$8.5M/day following the May-2020 halving.\n$29.1M/day at the start of 2021, up 242% since the halving.\n$46.0M/day at the time of writing, up 441% since the halving, and up 58% YTD.\nLive Chart\n\nAll-in-all, 2021 has been a wild ride for Bitcoin investors, traders, HODLers, analysts, miners, and critics alike. The protocol saw Taproot implemented, miners relocate out of the historically dominant location, and multiple rolls of the FUD dice, landing on all sides at least twice. As is tradition, Bitcoin comes out of the year stronger and more resilient, ready to solve more blocks, and create more opportunities in 2022.\n\nFrom the team at Glassnode, we wish you all a very Merry Christmas, and a happy holiday season with your friends and families.

Holders from lower prices want to pay themselves for the effort of waiting and taking on risk, and it results in profit taking and elevated activity from older coin cohorts.\n\nThe Spent Volume Age Bands, filtered below to display spent coins older than 6-months, illustrates what older spending volume can look like. In the late 2020 bull run, >6m coin spending comprised 7% of on-chain volume. Since then, successive peaks of spending from this group have declined, topping at just 3.5% of daily volume at the recent highs.\n\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis dynamic is also visible in the Realized Cap HODL Waves, which divvy up the circulating supply by their respective weighting in the Realized Cap, helping to emphasize recent spending.\n\nA key observation in the Realized Cap HODL Waves is the compression of the 3m-6m wave, which are owners of coins bought between mid June and September— essentially the year's lows. A squeezing of the 3m-6m band while the senior 6m-1y band bells outward shows coin maturation- as BTC lies dormant and accrues age, it graduates into the older cohort above.\n\nIn lockstep with the growing of the older 6m-1y group, is a rise in the youngest bands in October and November at the market all-time high. This behavior shows older coins being spent, which resets their lifespans to zero. Based on the squeeze of the 3m-6m band (and the 1m-3m band to a lesser degree), much of the recent spending emanated from these medium-term holders.\n\nThe take home message here is that much of the coin spending underway appears to be from coins purchased in the last 3m-6m, rather than longer-term holders.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAmong the investors anticipated to take action at the recent highs were Long-Term Holders, who are consistent distributors in price discovery. The cyclical nature of Long-Term Holders is as follows:\n\nSteady accumulation in bearish market phases, eventually reaching a level of 'Peak HODL'.\nSpending of profitable coins at the all-time high, realizing profits into market strength.\nBy the time price peaks and rolls over, Long-Term Holders have begun net accumulating again.\n\nDistribution events, visualized below as the 7-day change in Long-Term Holder Supply, typically result in peaks of 2% or more supply moved to new buyers. However the recent all-time highs and subsequent pullback have seen a peak spending rate of only 0.6%, just 30% of the expected amount from Long-Term Holders. These low time preference investors seem reticent to spend at current prices, which may speak to a sophistication in their decision making.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nShort-Term Coins Play Musical Chairs\n\nNew investors are the first group tested by price weakness. In the days following the November all-time high and beyond the liquidation flush of December 4, loss realization on-chain of $50-$100M per day was common. For loss realization to occur after an all-time high, those spenders must be top buyers.\n\nNet Realized Profit/Loss visualizes the daily outcome of on-chain spending in USD terms. Observe:\n\nConsistent profit taking around the all-time highs, as coins from lower prices are spent to new buyers.\nSteep loss realization in the days afterward as price pulled back over -30%. Losses realized after all-time highs indicates coins purchased at the top.\nRelatively flat activity in the past two weeks, suggesting investor interest is reaching an exhaustion point at current prices.\nLive Chart\n\nWith the understanding that older coin spending is declining, and Long-Term Holders mostly on the sidelines, we can intuit that recent coin activity is largely contained within the Short-Term Holder cohort. A look at the standing Profit/Loss ratio of Short-Term Holders can show the health of this group's supply and illustrate periods of overheated price action.\n\nHigh values over 1000 (red) indicate moments of extreme profitability for new investors. These moments are brief and often precede local reversals.\nValues between 100-1000 (yellow) mean newer buyers are in healthy profit.\nValues below 1 (blue) indicate Short-Term Holders in loss.\nLow values near or below 0.1 (green) are moments of heightened vulnerability for new buyers, and frequently mark local bottoms where value is established.\n\nShort-Term Holder PnL spiked dramatically in late October as price ripped to all-time highs. Buyers of coin from August and September suddenly found themselves up 60%+, and the market had to pull back to accommodate profit taking.\n\nPresently, Short-Term Holders finds themselves in aggregate loss, though the pace of decline has slowed along with price. While these coins continue to churn among different hands, their lifespans stay young and they remain members of Short-Term Holder Supply.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThe rotation of coins among newer owners can also be seen in the rate of change of Short-Term Holder Realized Price. As owners of the youngest supply, their cost basis is more responsive to price than their Long-Term Holder cousins. Interpretation of the costs basis for each cohort is nuanced and different:\n\nShort-Term Holder Realized Price rises when coins are spent from lower prices, causing them to be re-priced higher and thus raising the aggregate cost basis of the group.\nShort Term Holder Realized Price declines when price falls. Coins from higher prices are re-priced into new hands at lower costs, pulling down their cost basis.\nLong-Term Holder Realized Price rises when coins mature from increasingly higher prices as Bitcoin appreciates. The delay in adoption of this group makes their cost basis less responsive to price, and more beholden to maturation behavior by hodlers.\nLong-Term Holder Realized Price declines rarely, and typically only in prolonged bear markets. Rather than fall, it tends to go sideways as coins mature during long ranging periods for price.\n\nNote the recent increase in Short-Term Holder Realized Price at the October and November highs, showing the re-pricing of coins at higher prices as new investors bought the literal top.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThe ultimate perspective of coin rotation within the Short-Term Holder group is seen in the Percent of Entities in Profit. A remarkable observation on this chart is the arcing trend from late July to present day:\n\nIn late July, price was $32.3k and 76% of all entities on-chain were in profit.\nWhen new highs were created in October and November, 100% of entities were in profit— an expected outcome of price discovery.\nNow in late December, price is $47.6k (over $15k higher) and there are again only 76% of entities in profit.\n\nFor price to be over $15k higher (+47%) than summer while the same amount of investors are in profit, knowing that older spending is muted, a great shuffling of coins had to take place at the top within the Short-Term Holder group. That means they were coins mostly purchased since July, and signals that the current holder makeup is top heavy— many coins were bought at the top and now sit underwater.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs a cherry on top of the discussion about top heavy supply, we look at the Unrealized Price Distribution, which shows all circulating BTC by its last transacted price. A quick glance reveals that 24.6% of all supply is sitting above the current price around $47,000, meaning 1 in 4 BTC is currently underwater.\n\nLive Chart\nDespite Weakness, Strong Hands Continue Stacking\n\nA behavior that has left its stamp on the 2021 Bitcoin market is the steadfast accumulation by investors with a limited history of spending. Illiquid Supply is the amount of BTC held by on-chain entities with >=75% inflows in their ledger history.\n\nThe supply in possession of these Illiquid entities sold off in May along with much of the market. Since that time, they have maintained a consistent pressure of accumulation, and are now taking possession of coins at a rate of 3.4x daily coin issuance.\n\nPut another way, strong handed HODLers are absorbing supply at more than triple the rate of new coins being mined each day.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nStrong hands are not the only investors pulling coins away from potential buyers. After a large impulse of deposits to exchanges in May (over $300M on a 14-day basis), Bitcoin has been steadily pulled offline into cold storage in the months following the summer lows.\n\nThe chart below shows the net transfer volume to/from all exchanges, which is the difference between all deposits and all withdrawals in USD terms. The initial all-time high break in late October saw around $100M of inflows, but the weeks following have been dominated by consistent exchange outflow volume, seeing average values of -$150M to -$175M on a 14-day basis.\n\nPrice weakness has so far not engendered a rush to the exits, as investors are instead creating friction between their ownership and the ability to sell their BTC.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOne group that doesn't have a reputation for being strong handed is the miners, who have been a consistent source of spending pressure on the Bitcoin network since inception. Well, perhaps their reputation is in need of an overhaul!\n\nIn the past two years, miner behavior has undergone a transformation. Newer, more powerful chips have enhanced operational efficiency, and the expansion of miners into North America has given many of them access to operating capital by exercising cheap debt and corporate equity. The typical miner in 2021 is more resilient than past generations.\n\nWhat once was a reliable outflow of spending from miner wallets has shifted since 2019, and miners are now depositing more minted supply into their treasuries than before. The chart below shows the 90-day sum of Miner Netflow Volume (in USD) as a percentage of Market Cap, and the multi-year rise is evident.\n\nIf miners evolve into being HODLers, a group who are naturally incentivized to spend, then acquiring new Bitcoin into the future could become exceedingly difficult.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nIn case you missed it, the past week saw circulating supply pass the 90% mark of its ultimate goal, with circulating supply passing 18.9M BTC. In just under thirteen years, 9/10ths of the total BTC supply has now been issued to miners. Bitcoin's deterministic issuance schedule has much farther to go however, with the remaining 10% of supply set to be minted over the next 119 years or so, ending somewhere near the year 2140.\n\nWith so many holder types stacking BTC for the long term, future opportunities to acquire the world's first absolutely scarce digital asset are increasingly limited.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nProduct Updates\nGlassnode System Status now available.\nAdded FTX to Bitcoin exchange metrics.\nNew navigation tool using cmd+k shortcut in Studio.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week Onchain (Week 50, 2021)\n\nBitcoin bulls attempt to hold the $50k price level as strong demand pulls coins out of exchanges. However, network profitability suggests this may be the bull/bear line in the sand.\n\nPermabull Nino, Glassnode\nDec 13, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has attempted to regain its footing, following a tumultuous and volatile deleveraging event last week. Bitcoin prices were largely range-bound, opening at $49,368, and trading between a high of $51,900, and a low of $46,942.\n\nAfter significant market volatility like last week's deleveraging event, it's valuable to assess the broad investor response, changes in spending patterns and sentiment, and new emergent trends that are observable in on-chain and derivative data. To achieve this goal, this week's newsletter will make comparisons between the recent deleveraging, and the market structure experienced through May to July.\n\nDiscussion of the points above will aim to provide context to the current state of Bitcoin markets, and where we are within the Bitcoin accumulation and distribution game.\n\nLive Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nRealization of Profits and Loss\n\nAfter large price drawdowns it's natural for some holders to Realize Losses, out of fear that the market is due for further downside, or in capitulation as well below the holder's cost basis.\n\nWe're currently observing an acceleration of Realized Losses among holders, trending above $1 Billion daily on two occasions during this correction. While Realized Losses only directly show underwater supply being spent, we typically assume this reflects an upper bound magnitude on new sell pressure, as coins enter back into liquid circulation.\n\nIf we compare the current deleveraging to the one in May, we can see:\n\nMay-July 2021 drawdown shows a deceleration in Realized Losses after the initial capitulation event, as top buyers transferred coins to exchanges for sale.\nOct-Dec 2021 drawdown shows an acceleration in Realized Losses indicating a more trigger friendly, and cautious approach by the market, potentially indicative of nervousness of further downside.\nLive Chart\n\nHowever a key difference between these two events can be seen in Exchange Net Flows and the impact on overall exchange balances. In May-July, exchanges saw an enormous influx of some +168k BTC on net over a span of three months. In the current Oct-Dec correction, we have seen a total of 49k BTC flow out of exchanges, making for quite the contrast.\n\nLive Chart\n\nLooking to exchange Net Flow Volumes (on a 7D EMA basis), we can see that the current market is firmly in a regime of net outflows, with 3k to 5k BTC in daily outflows common. Overall, whilst significant losses are most certainly being realized on-chain, they are being met with a significant, and arguably overwhelming demand.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can also look to market momentum using the 28-day Market Realised Gradient (MRG). This tool measures the relative momentum between price action (Market Cap) and capital flows onchain (Realized Cap). High or descending values have historically provided a signal to take caution, and low or ascending values have historically provided a signal for a more risk-on approach.\n\nCurrent MRG values display Bitcoin as being in an oversold state, with historically low MRG values. However, the metric has yet to fully level out and plateau, indicating that price and capital flows are both still attempting to reestablish a healthy equilibrium. Early confirmation would be found on a technical break higher, and full confirmation with a break back above the zero bound.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe other side of the onchain equation are investors realizing profits, whom are most often longer-term holders. The magnitude of Realized Profits is in a similar decline to that seen in the first half of 2021 suggesting that fewer profitable coins are spent as the correction proceeds. This is partly due to lower prices, but also signals that in-profit holders are not as interested in spending at current levels.\n\nHowever, declining realized profits in Jan-May occurred alongside a topping price pattern, suggesting weaker demand as time moved on. Declining realized profits during a correction, as seen in May-July, and at present, likely indicate a returning conviction, and reducing desire to divest at these prices.\n\nA significant return to elevated values in this metric, especially if accompanied by price weakness would be cause for concern however, as it would likely indicate deteriorating conviction among the in-profit cohort, and a fear of further downside.\n\nLive Chart\nThe Aftermath of Deleveraging\n\nAs the Bitcoin market matures, derivative products have become an increasingly relevant influence on price action. Following a deleveraging event, it is also important to assess whether the market is adding more leverage, as traders 'long the dip', or whether the market remains cautious in response to the volatility.\n\nThis influence of futures markets on price is particularly dominant during periods where Futures Open Interest climbs above the 380k BTC level. It becomes particularly concerning after a strong price run up and the extended period of Realized Profit prints we observed earlier as:\n\nStrong hands and traders transfer coins to newer holders, whom have a higher cost basis and are more sensitive to volatility.\nHigh Futures Open Interest provides fuel for a volatile, futures-driven move.\n\nThese factors were both prevalent in the May and November tops, which resulted in a cleansing of Futures Open Interest back to ~340k BTC. Note however that Open Interest has climbed by around 5k BTC over the last week. A key metric to watch from here on is whether open interest starts to climb aggressively This would indicate a higher chance that liquidation levels and stop-losses are clustering around the current trading range, and increased expectations of derivative led volatility.\n\nLive Chart\n\nPerpetual futures funding rates are a core data-point for assessing the markets directional bias. Funding Rates help peg the price of these futures as closely to the spot Bitcoin price as possible by:\n\nMaking longs pay shorts (green) when Perpetual Futures price > spot price\nMaking shorts pay longs (red) when spot price > Perpetual Futures price\n\nExtreme values in Funding Rates have historically signaled peak euphoria, or misery for market participants, often correlating with local market highs and lows, respectively. Before the drawdown last week, we witnessed a local euphoria, evident in the large relative spike in Funding Rates, almost precisely at the market ATH. At the lows of the week, we experienced the opposite, with the first negative print since the $40k lows in October.\n\nWhile some of this is due to the deleveraging event that took place, two things are worth considering:\n\nLeveraged traders were forced to close their positions, clearing out stop-losses and liquidation levels down to $45k (and even lower on some exchanges).\nFunding rates are only slightly positive at present, and are not climbing significantly. This adds further evidence that a large majority of 'excessive' leverage has been cleared from the market. Similar to Open Interest, this is a metric worth keeping an eye on.\nLive Chart\n\nFutures Volume also spiked during the event, which has historically provided notable pivot points in price action. On the most recent impulse Futures Volume in aggregate was ~2 Million BTC.\n\nWhile this sum in Futures Volume is significant, it remains relatively small compared to both the May and September 2021 drawdowns. Furthermore, it is part of a consistent decline in overall volume that has been established since May.\n\nThis seems counter-intuitive as price has more than doubled to ATHs since then, and price increases would seem like an appropriate pairing with increased trading volumes. Note also that volumes are also down on a USD basis versus early 2021, so it's not a function of higher prices equating to less BTC traded.\n\nThis change could therefore be a combination of:\n\nFutures traders having a lower risk appetite after the historic May 2021 drawdown.\nTraders taking their funds to other markets such as altcoins.\nA view the Bitcoin markets are still in fact in a longer term macro consolidation, digesting the appreciation, volatility and rapidly changing global events since this time last year.\nLive Chart\n\nAfter a deleveraging event, it is typical that spot markets (and thus on-chain data) return as the dominant forcing function for dictating price movements. A useful tool for identifying this transition between derivative led and spot/onchain led market structure is to look at Perpetual Futures Open Interest as a proportion of the Bitcoin Market Cap:\n\nHigh values (>1.3%) signal derivatives dominance\nLow values (<1.1%) signal spot dominance\n\nWhile these values have not reverted to historically low levels such as those seen in May, they've returned to much healthier levels, previously seen throughout the late 2021 move from $30k to $60k+. This further supports that a meaningful deleveraging event has occurred, and the market appears to be responding with caution, rather than levering up once again.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFinally, we will close out with investor profitability. We can use Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) as a gauge for when additional sell-side may be activated should Bitcoin prices languish, or decline further. The historical battleground for bulls and bears sits at a network-wide profitability of 50%, meaning half of the Bitcoin Market Cap is held as unrealized profit.\n\nIn bear trends this zone provides resistance, as holders are increasingly willing to cut their positions at moderate profit, as can be seen in the May to July price action.\nIn bull trends this zone provides support from holders looking add to their profitable positions, as can be seen through August to November.\n\nPer this chart, the current leg down in price seems to resemble a correction within a larger bull trend - a stark contrast to May where NUPL sliced cleanly through the 50% level. However, the transition between this area marks the difference between Belief-denial (green coloration) and Optimism-Anxiety (yellow coloration), an appropriate description for current holder sentiment at present.\n\nAs the Bitcoin market consolidates, it appears that derivatives markets have taken more of a back-seat relative to spot markets, and a meaningful deleveraging event has occurred. There are signs conviction is returning to spot investors and demand remains significant, however the market still sits atop a key level of psychological support as seen in the NUPL metric. It is possible that this trading range is defining the bull-bear line in the sand, and a key risk is whether a possible transition into less favourable conditions occurs should it fail to hold.\n\nLive Chart\nProduct Updates\nGlassnode System Status now available.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week Onchain (Week 49, 2021)\n\nBitcoin markets have experienced another liquidation cascade, with prices falling $8.8k in a single day, forcing closed over $5.4B worth of futures contracts.\n\nTXMC, Glassnode\nDec 6, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nBitcoin closed the month of November with extreme volatility and significant losses, exacerbated by a massive liquidation event in futures markets. This follows concerns about Federal Reserve tapering efforts, and the emergence of the Omicron virus variant, which has led to weakness across both Bitcoin and traditional markets.\n\nBitcoin opened the week at $54,815 and rallied to a high of $59,041, before plummeting to a low of $45,032 on Saturday. At the lows, this puts the market down -34.5% from the all-time high set on November 9.\n\nTo characterise this volatility, this week's newsletter will explore:\n\nThe de-leveraging event that occurred and drove much of the weekend sell-off,\nLosses realized on-chain, assessed across various investor cohorts,\nThe impact on HODLer supply dynamics, and what coin holding patterns tell us about sentiment.\nLive Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nHigh Volume meets High Volatility\n\nIn last week's newsletter and video report, we covered the elevated risks posed by high open interest in Bitcoin futures markets, where sustained peak levels created the necessary fuel for a high volatility event. Legacy market weakness on Friday weighed on all assets globally, holding Bitcoin's price around $53K and near pivotal technical support.\n\nWhen price failed to hold, sell pressure triggered a cascade of long liquidations. Within hours, Futures Open Interest had been flushed of $5.4 billion in contracts, a reduction if -24.5% in total value from the space.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe chain of contract closures on Saturday amounted to a total rinse of 58,202 BTC in value. In BTC denomination, this liquidation was the second largest single day change in Futures Open Interest in 2021, bested only by the historic sell-off on May 19 that totalled 79,244 BTC.\n\nOther notable events this year include:\n\nMay 12 - The same day Tesla announced it would no longer accept Bitcoin as payment for electric vehicles.\nJuly 26 - A short squeeze helped propel the rally out of the summer lows.\nSeptember 7 - The same day El Salvador began to accept Bitcoin as legal tender.\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nThe futures market is not the only derivatives space that has seen high volume and interest in recent weeks. Options activity tends to spike on days of sell-offs and rallies where hedge traders look to capture volatility premiums. Last week's flush saw the second highest hourly options volume since mid-May—  more than $1.7 billion per hour.\n\nAdditionally, Options Volume has increased more than >250% since July, now regularly settling over $1 billion daily.\n\nLive Chart\nPerpetual Futures Hit Reset Button\n\nThe Futures Perpetual Funding Rate represents the directional bias of leveraged positions, and helps to manage balance in the perpetual futures market.\n\nWhen the funding rates are positive, long traders are paying a premium to shorts for the privilege of keeping their positions open. In periods of sustained bullish price, this can be the cost of doing business.\nLikewise, when the funding rates are negative, shorts are paying longs as a majority bear bias dominates futures.\n\nWhen aggressive cascades of closures are ignited, the force of liquidations can push aggregate funding across the median line and in the opposite direction, which occurred on Saturday. After $5.4 billion in Open Interest was flushed, the Perpetual Funding Rate plummeted to -0.035%, demonstrating a complete reset of the funding bias.\n\nThe reset of funding represents the first negative aggregate rate since late September, and the deepest discount since the previous sustained negative regime in July.\n\nLive Chart\n\nSince the last funding reset, the perpetual market had maintained a premium regime for over two months. Confidence among traders can oscillate over time, and monitoring the trend of Long Liquidations Dominance can provide insights into the cyclical shifts in speculator sentiment.\n\nAs price rose out of the July lows, the existing short bias from summer carried into the rally. Short liquidations dominated futures for weeks as biases were tested, and it wasn't until early October when the trend began to reverse.\n\nConfidence had fully shifted hands by late October, and a consistent premium regime led the market while long traders felt the pain of liquidations. These cyclical trends are part of the natural oscillation of markets.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhenever price creates new highs, there are invariably traders who buy the top. These new investors are the first group tested by the next period of uncertainty, and nothing spells uncertainty like a flash sell-off in futures.\n\nWith cascading liquidations come spenders in loss, and last week's event set a recent high for Realized Losses on-chain. The sum of coins spent in loss for December 4 totalled $3 billion. Coming into Saturday, previous high marks were set on May 19 and June 25, with losses of $4.5B and $3.8B respectively.\n\nLive Chart\nHODLers Set the Floor\n\nNow that we have assessed the derivatives space, we turn our eyes to the on-chain supply dynamics that illustrate HODLer behavior. The various cohorts of Bitcoin supply that comprise the HODLer class are the inertial bellwethers we use for determining macro market direction, and (assumed) smart-money sentiment.\n\nThe HODL Waves visualize the entirety of Bitcoin's supply divvied up by the age of coins. The interpretation is as follows:\n\nNewly spent coins have lifespans of zero, and they appear in the younger bands (warmer colors) at the bottom to begin aging.\nAs coins lay dormant and mature, they graduate into older, higher cohorts (cooler colors).\n\nWhen filtered to show coins younger than 3 months, we see that only 2.63% of older coin supply has been distributed into this group since October 27. That means that over 97% of the supply older than 3 months has remained unspent since the recent all-time high and pullback. HODLers of older coins are not spending them, by and large.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo add depth to this perspective, we look at Dormancy. Dormancy measures the average age of transactions (in days) on-chain per unit of BTC spent. It is similar to the Average Spent Output Lifespan, but with a volume weighting.\n\nRising Dormancy means older coins are being spent at higher volumes.\nDeclining Dormancy indicates a reduction in older coin spending volume.\n\nThe average baseline level for 2020 was a Dormancy level of 40 days, and we are well below that value now, sitting at an average of 25 days. In fact, Dormancy has been in a macro decline since the height of the bull run in January. The implication is that HODLer cohorts are exhibiting steady maturation behavior, and activity on-chain is dominated by younger coins.\n\nGenerally speaking, this demonstrates high conviction, despite extreme volatility and losses. Quite the contrast to this week's price action.\n\nLive Chart\n\nKnowing that older coins continue to sit dormant, we can look at exchanges to determine how much activity may be occurring there, and corroborate our theory of a lack of distribution.\n\nExchange Fee Dominance looks at total exchange activity as a percentage of on-chain fees each day. High activity can be interpreted as characteristic of elevated interest or urgency for holders.\n\nWhen this value is high or rising, exchanges are producing elevated settlement activity on-chain, as seen in late 2020 and into spring 2021 during the bull run.\nFlat or declining activity means that exchanges are experiencing a reduction in settlement on-chain, and could be seeing quieter activity overall as interest wanes or investors calm down.\n\nThe observation to make about Exchange Fee Dominance is the precipitous decline since the recent all-time high. Exchange fees are now at their lowest share of on-chain settlement activity since October 2020.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe balance of BTC on exchanges is a metric worth monitoring in periods of volatility, as it marks the primary barrier to exit for holders: placing coins on an exchange for sale.\n\nWe observe the flow of coins to/from exchanges here by looking at Exchange Net Transfer Volume. During the capitulation in May, exchanges saw a notable and sustained uptick of BTC inflows, with periods of 10.4k and 13.9k net BTC deposits. This contrasts with the present moment, where recent peak exchange inflows are a fraction of the size, at 2k and 3.2k BTC. Bitcoin holders aren't behaving as they have in prior moments of weakness, hinting at an underlying confidence, and largely confirming weakness was more heavily influenced by derivative markets rather than spot selling.\n\nLive Chart\n\nSo if older coins are not being spent in notable size, and exchanges are not seeing elevated activity, then where are spent coins coming from?\n\nThey're coming from Short Term Holders— investors who bought in the past few months, most of whom are spending at a loss.\n\nShort-Term Holder SOPR shows the profitability of coins spent by Short-Term Holders. The chart below is interpreted as:\n\nHigher value prints indicate profit taking by coins spent from lower prices.\nBounces against a value of 1 are tests of holders' cost basis.\nPrints below 1 indicate coins being spent in loss.\n\nShort-Term Holder SOPR printed its lowest value since late July, which shows the hallmark signature of a capitulation by newer investors. For Short-Term Holders to be realizing losses here means they had to buy their coins at the recent tops, and are already spending them to new hands. This group appears to be the only cohort reacting significantly to the events of last week. More mature HODLers remain unmoved.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThrough our observations of the data, last week's sell-off was driven by liquidations in the futures market, and the various on-chain cohorts that make up Bitcoin's supply remain largely unfazed. Those who are spending coins appear to be predominantly those who bought the top, and they are realizing losses and capitulating.\n\nHigh levels of leverage followed by price volatility is a classic recipe for a correction, and capitulative moments like Bitcoin just experienced are unfortunately needed for markets to return to a healthy equilibrium. The key question we will seek to answer in the coming weeks, is whether market sentiment has taken a severe enough hit that the underlying conviction seen this week deteriorates, or does it hold on.\n\nProduct Updates\nWorkbench formulas can now refer to other formulas as f1, f2 etc.\nReleased Pi Cycle Top indicator.\nCorrections for ETH and ERC20 exchange inflow and outflow data.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week Onchain (Week 48, 2021)\n\nThe market continues to drawdown this week, despite Short- and Long-Term investors holding more profitable supply than the recent correction in September.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nNov 29, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nBitcoin traded lower this week, alongside weakness across many traditional assets, largely due to renewed concerns over new virus variants. Bitcoin's price opened at a high of $59,339, and reached the lowest price for the month of $53,569. This continues the price correction that has been in play for most of November.\n\nWith Bitcoin now over 20% below the all-time-high, headlines in traditional media have declared that Bitcoin has entered a bear market. However it may surprise some readers that this current market correction is actually the least severe in 2021. Some might even say business as usual for a Bitcoin HODLer.\n\nSell-offs in Jan, Feb and April all reached drawdowns as deep as -24.2% from the ATH before reverting. The deepest drawdown this year was obviously the period from May to July, where the market reached a -54% drawdown at the lows. The most recent correction in September was actually the second deepest, reaching -37.2% from April's ATH, and 25.2% off the local high of $53k.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn this week's newsletter, we will be assessing the market structure during this drawdown from three different angles to identify investor sentiment across cohorts, and potential risks for further downside. We will focus on:\n\nDerivatives markets and the state of leverage in the system.\nShort-Term Holders and the recent retest of their onchain cost basis.\nLong-Term Holders and the state of their distribution and profitability.\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nCME Futures Dominance Climbs\n\nIt is important to pay attention to the state of Bitcoin derivatives markets, as they can often be a source of excessive leverage which can unwind in a fairly spectacularly way from time to time.\n\nIn options markets, we continue to see between $12B and $14B in nominal open interest throughout October and November. The total open interest has come off the highs this week, down to approximately $10 Billion following the expiry of the 26-November contracts.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFutures open interest is also just below all-time-highs when denominated in BTC, reaching just above 400k BTC in total nominal value. Denominating in BTC is used to remove the influence of coin price on this metric (such as coin-margined contracts), and aide in identifying periods of rapidly growing leverage, or de-leveraging.\n\nHighlighted in the chart below are a number of short and long squeezes, where open interest rapidly decreased as price volatility forced traders to cover their positions. With leverage in futures markets near an ATH, there is a risk that leverage may unwind, as has been demonstrated in almost all prior instances where open interest surpassed 350k BTC in size.\n\nLive Chart\n\nHowever, for all futures positions, buyers are matched equally with sellers, meaning there is limited information on likely market direction in the event of a leverage squeeze. Perpetual futures funding rates can give some insight into the market's directional bias, and at the time of writing, remains slightly positive (bullish bias). However it is notable that funding rates have generally declined alongside falling price, suggesting traders are more cautious as the correction proceeds.\n\nHowever, whilst funding is positive, the decline is quite significant, which doesn't rule out the possibility that a large portion of the market is net short as price declines. It is reasonably plausible for a leverage squeeze to play out in either direction given this observation.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOn a more specific note, since the launch of the Bitcoin futures backed ETFs in the US markets, the dominance of both open interest (pink), and futures trade volume (blue) on the CME has exploded higher.\n\nThe chart below shows that contracts opened on the CME market now represents over 19.3% of all futures open interest, an almost doubling from the 10% dominance in early-September. Similarly, trade volume on the CME has risen from just 1.4%, to 6.0% over the same period.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\nShort-Term Holder Analysis\n\nIn the last two weeks newsletters (46 and 47) we focused on a number of metrics related to Short-Term Holders, whose coins are younger than ~155-days. We also noted that the Realised Price of the Short-Term Holder cohort was hovering at around $53k, and would likely provide market support.\n\nThis week, price traded to a low of $53.5k, which whilst not a technical touch, does suggest a potential front-running of that psychological cost basis support level was in play. This is now the second retest of the STH Realised Price in the current trend, and if held, has similarities to major corrections observed in 2017, where it acted as reliable support.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nA common onchain behaviour we see near the lows of bull market corrections are top buyers capitulating and realising losses. In many ways, bottoms cannot be hammered out until these potential sellers are exhausted.\n\nLooking to overall realised profits and losses, we can see two recent events in play:\n\nRealised Profits (green) have declined alongside the correction, potentially signalling reducing profit taking, and growing investor conviction.\nRealised Losses spiked (pink) to $800M per day, similar to significant sell-offs in April, and July, but much lower than the major sell-off in May. This suggests a reasonable flush out of spot top buyers has occurred, but does not rule out further sell-side.\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nZooming into the STH cohort specifically, the STH Profit/Loss ratio has fallen just below 1 this week. This indicates that spending by STH are realising losses on net. Similar to the STH Realised Price, this represents a test of investor conviction as prices return to, or below their on-chain cost basis. Ideally, market strength needs to step in reasonably soon, else the probability of STHs selling at or around their cost basis will likely increase.\n\nLive Chart\n\nNow whilst price is testing STH conviction, and trading around their cost basis, the market is actually in a healthier position when compared to the September correction. The total proportion of supply held by STHs that is in profit has increased by 60%, from 5.78% of circulating supply in September, to 9.20% today. STH supply in loss has accordingly declined from 12.3% to 9.6% of circulating supply.\n\nMore STH supply is in profit, price is retesting their cost basis, and top buyers are realising losses on-chain. In bull market conditions, this combination usually sets out a fairly constructive short-term outlook. The key 'watch-it' is whether the market can convincingly hold the STH Realised Price at ~$53k.\n\nLive Chart\nLong-Term Holder Analysis\n\nShifting our focus to Long-Term Holders, we can see that there has been a reasonably continuous rate of spending over the last month. From the peak of 13.5M BTC in holdings, LTHs have spent (assumed distributed) 150k BTC, equivalent to around 5.8% of the volume accumulated since March 2021.\n\nLive Chart\n\nPerforming a similar breakdown assessment as for STHs, we can see that the proportion of LTH supply in profit has also increased since the September lows. Whilst LTH supply in profits has increased from 72.3% to 75.8% of circulating supply, the proportion at a loss has fallen from 9.65% to 5.80%.\n\nIn comparison to the correction in September, the balance of supply in profit vs loss is actually much healthier, both for STHs and LTHs. Whilst the risk of further downside certainly remains, forced selling in the mid-50k's by investors holding too much underwater supply is unlikely to be the cause.\n\nLive Chart\n\nSo now that we have established LTHs are spending some of their holdings, we can look to the LTH-SOPR to assess the relative profitability of the coins that are on the move. Marked on the chart below is the approximate time in late June where the STH-LTH threshold of 155-days is for context.\n\nHere we can see that the LTH-SOPR metric is in a macro decline, indicating that since March, the profitability of LTH spent coins has been falling. Note also how this week especially, LTH-SOPR has fallen rapidly, again suggesting smaller profit multiples are being realised.\n\nThe most important observation is the divergence since August, where LTH-SOPR trades lower as prices trade higher. There are two primary factors behind this observation:\n\nThe LTH threshold now encompasses the first half of 2021 in which the market traded well above last cycles $20k ATH. LTH coins can simply now have a higher cost basis.\nLTHs who are spending at the moment, are spending coins purchased closer to the current price. This could be interpreted as LTHs de-risking, panic selling closer to their cost basis, or selling coins with the lowest tax burden (highest cost basis).\nLive Chart\n\nFinally, we can use LTH-SOPR to divulge an estimate average 'spent coin cost-basis'. In other words, for all the LTH spent coins each day, what was the average price they we last moved at?\n\nBy taking the ratio of market price and LTH-SOPR, we can see that the 'LTH Spent Price' ticked up to $34.3k this week (green). Extreme peaks and troughs in this metric often occur around local market tops and bottoms, often an indicator of strategic profit taking (high profit multiples), or panic selling (lower profit multiples), respectively.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nIn summary this week, we have:\n\nMarket sentiment taking a hit, despite the drawdown from ATH actually being one of the least severe in 2021\nOpen interest leverage in options and futures at or near ATHs, which is cause for some concern regarding heightened 'flush out' potential. Funding rates suggest an only slightly positive bias, making both a long- or short- squeeze plausible scenarios.\nPrice has retested the Short-Term Holder onchain cost basis and bounced. Holding this level at $53k is key to support a bull market.\nLong-Term Holders have distributed 5.8% of the supply accumulated since March and some uncertainty exists based on their spending patterns.\nBoth Long and Short-term Holders are holding more profitable supply than September's correction, which can generally be viewed as constructive for price.\nProduct Updates\nRelease 3iQ QBTC and BTCQ metrics.\nReleased Pi Cycle Top indicator.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

While price stays pinned below new highs and sentiment remains scattered, Bitcoin's stakeholders are actively adjusting to new market information.\n\nThis has shown up as a recent shifting of coin distribution amongst holders, which will likely impact the market's short-term response. This weeks newsletter will assess the balance in both the macro and micro changes in on-chain sentiment and coin holdings following this week's price volatility. Our analysis will address:\n\nThe sharp move lower in price, the aftermath of overhead / unprofitable supply associated with it, and holders' spending behavior in response to volatility.\nThe \"big picture\" market trends in play, which will aim to provide context on where things stand and considerations moving forward.\nShort term holders (STH), their active role in the market this week, and in aggregate.\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nAssessing Momentum, Supply & Spending\n\nLast week's newsletter established the following:\n\nRealized Profits have been increasing, and elevated since reaching $60k+.\nRealized Losses have been flat for weeks, a natural byproduct of upwards trending price action.\nAs function of the two previous points, the Realized Cap has broken to new highs, establishing a higher plateau for the network-wide cost basis.\n\nGenerally speaking, spikes in on-chain profit-taking during bullish impulses are to be expected as price climbs to new highs, and are typical for any bull market. As the realisation of profits increase, so too does the probability of establishing a macro top.\n\nAs such, an increase in Realized Profits and Realized Cap generally indicates that:\n\nIncreased realization of profits is an estimate of sell pressure, which needs to be absorbed by an increasing inflow of demand in order to maintain sideways, or upwards price momentum.\nThe buyers of these coins (i.e. Short Term Holders) have an elevated cost-basis, making them more sensitive to shorter term moves in price.\nLive Chart\n\nThe combination of these factors can cause a stall in market momentum, and establish a local top. One tool to identify this shift in momentum is the 28-day Market-Realised Gradient. This metric was recently released to Workbench as a pre-set, and measures the relative change in momentum between speculative value (price), and true organic capital inflows (realised price). Interpretation of the chart is as follows:\n\nPositive Delta Gradient: uptrend is in play for time period in consideration.\nNegative Delta Gradient: downtrend is in play for time period in consideration.\nIncreasing Delta Gradient: Momentum is to the upside as capital flows can support price (trend continuation).\nDecreasing Delta Gradient: Momentum is to the downside as capital flows cannot support price (bearish divergence).\n\nPrior to the price drop this week, the 28-day Market Realised Gradient displayed fading momentum with a sideways price. This same signature occurred before the steep price drop in May, and the initial rejection from $50k in September. As price made higher highs, the momentum behind each one was declining creating a bearish divergence.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs the market sell-off, the Percent Supply in Profit metric, can provide insight into the profitability and cost basis of market participants and the coin supply. Takeaways include:\n\n15% of the Bitcoin supply has an on-chain cost basis greater than $57k.\nThis is a relatively top heavy distribution among Bitcoin holders, which can be identified by comparing previous periods where Percent Supply in Profit was at 85%-90%.\nPrice currently sits in the bull / bear transition zone between 85%-90%. 15% of supply underwater has historically been sufficient to create reflexive downside if price cannot reclaim higher levels in a reasonable timeframe.\nLive Chart\n\nUTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) shows at which prices the current set of Bitcoin UTXOs were created, i.e. each bar shows the amount of existing BTC that last moved within that specified price bucket. There are various clusters of coins from key levels throughout 2021, with the largest being the 1.9 Million BTC moved between $60k and $68k. This overhead supply could provide resistance in the coming weeks should underwater holders look to cut their losses.\n\nLive Chart\n\nShort term holders (STH) are most responsive to price action due to a combination of having a higher relative cost-basis, a higher time preference, and potentially a lower degree of conviction in the asset. This week's price action was no exception, as STHs played a role in setting both the highs and the lows:\n\nSTH-SOPR spiked to 1.1 near the highs of the week, a historically high value and one that is associated with large amounts of profit-taking.\nSTH-SOPR dipped below 1 near the lows of the week, a value that has historically bounced price during bull runs as STHs cost-basis gets tested and top buyers capitulate.\nSTH-SOPR remaining below 1 for an extended period of time would be a signal to market participants to take caution, and increase probabilities of an extended downside.\nSTH-SOPR values on the macro scale remain relatively flat compared to the early 2021 price run up, possibly signalling that the market hasn't become overly saturated with profit-taking yet. This is a more constructive medium term observation.\nLive Chart\nZooming Out: Recovery Considerations\n\nWe've established that price drew down, and that STHs actively participated in both sides of the action by taking large profits at the highs, and spending at break even near the lows.\n\nNow we will look at the performance of STH holdings via STH MVRV Ratio and STH Realized Price. Similar to STH SOPR, these metrics have historically been high signal means for gauging market conditions and sentiment, by tracking price versus the cost basis of STHs. Application of these metrics provide the following information:\n\nSTH MVRV values = 1 represent a typical bull / bear line in the sand. It indicates price has returned to the STH on-chain cost basis, and they typically aim to defend that level in bull markets. Conversely, in a bear market, STHs will generally offload coins at their break even price, forming resistance.\nSTH Realized Price is currently at $53k, signalling any moves near that level will likely be a battle ground to reestablish bull dominance should price trade down for another leg. Should $53k be lost, it would signal a potential need for caution as the probabilities of a 'top heavy' market creating more sell-side are likely to have increased.\nLive Chart\n\nSpent Volume Age Bands identify the age of coins dominating the on-chain flows on any given day. This can help analysts determine when and where long term holders (i.e. those with the most conviction) are spending their BTC. While this tool doesn't necessarily provide precision for finding tops / bottoms in price, it demonstrates when the process of profit-taking or accumulation begins. It can also be used to track sentiment of various cohorts of investors.\n\nWith late 2020 / early 2021 as a case study, consistent spending of coins aged greater than 1 month (> 5% of daily BTC onchain volume) began November 2020, and ended in April-May 2021. Since bottoming around $30k, Bitcoin has had one SVAB spike at $40k in August, and another above $60k in October.\n\nSince then, SVAB values have reverted back to 2.5% of daily volume, suggesting older coins are increasingly dormant, especially as prices pull-back. This can reasonably be interpreted as longer term holders reducing their spending, and thus are more likely to be adding to positions, not exiting them.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis trend of long term holder (LTH) HODLing can also be seen in the supply dynamics. The total supply held by STHs can only increase in three instances:\n\nWhen new coins being mined (which have zero coin days accumulated),\nWhen coins are withdrawn from exchanges, or\nWhen LTHs spend their holdings.\n\nThe chart below shows that total supply held by STHs is at multi-year lows (<3 Million BTC), which means LTH supply is at multi-year highs by contrast. Low STH supply is typical at the end of bear markets and in early bull markets, usually following long periods of accumulation. Seeing STH supply this low whilst price is near ATHs is a relatively unique case.\n\nLive Chart\nProduct Updates\nReleased new workbench preset: Value Days Destroyed Multiple\nAdded max  & min functions to Workbench\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week Onchain (Week 46, 2021)\n\nBitcoin breaks to new all-time-highs as the on-chain dynamics reach an inflection point. We analyse changes in spending patterns, and identify tools for navigating bull market tops.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nNov 15, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market pushed to a yet another ATH this week, peaking at $68,742, before pulling back to a low of $62,401. The market is currently consolidating, having held onto the majority of the gains, and finding support at this new altitude. This week also saw the activation of the Bitcoin Taproot upgrade, a remarkable achievement for the network, contributors, and BTC holders. Congratulations.\n\nThis week, we will analyse three core concepts within on-chain analytics; describing an inflection point in capital inflows, spending patterns, and tools to help navigate the next phase of the bull market. We assess:\n\nIncreasing spending by long-term holders and the macro impact on coin-days destroyed.\nEstimating the magnitude of capital inflows as new investors buy distributed coins.\nModels for identifying market cycle tops, using both historical mean reversion methods, and observations of on-chain spending.\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nSpending Inflection Point\n\nIn last weeks newsletter, we described two typical phases of a bull market, and how market structure transitions from smart money accumulation, into distribution.\n\nOne of the most powerful on-chain tools to track this inflection point is the concept of lifespan, measured by coin-days destroyed (CDD). Each unit of BTC accumulates one coin-day, per day (i.e. 0.5BTC accumulates half a coin-day per day). When the coin is spent, the accumulated lifespan is destroyed, reset to zero, and begins re-accumulating again.\n\nWhen old coins with large accumulated lifespans are spent, it will destroy a greater number of coin-days, and is often associated with long-term investors exiting positions. Bull markets can usually absorb many months of this distribution, but as selling continues, the probability of establishing a local or global top increases.\n\nThe chart below shows the 30d moving average of CDD, and demonstrates the transition from heavy accumulation in July to Nov, into a recent uptrend, signifying increased spending. Note also how the magnitude of CDD in H1 2021 was significantly higher, and was sustained for months. This highlights how an abundance of demand through a bull is capable of soaking up newly distributed supply.\n\nLive Chart\n\nBinary CDD, with a 7-day moving average applied, shows these trends in a more responsive format. This metric will trend higher when CDD is higher than the long term average for extended periods. We can see that whilst it is currently elevated, Binary CDD is barely above a value of 0.2, which has parallels to Sept-Nov 2020 before the primary bullish impulse. Spending of older coins is happening, although remains small in relative magnitude.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOn a macro scale, we look to Liveliness which takes the ratio between cumulative coin-day destruction, and cumulative coin-day creation. The simple interpretation is:\n\nLiveliness trends lower when more coin dormancy and HODLing is in play.\nLiveliness trends higher when more coin-day destruction and spending is in play.\nSteeper curves mean greater HODLing/Distribution as appropriate.\n\nHere we can see that after 6-months of HODLing (downtrend, green), Liveliness has plateaued and started a very slight uptrend. Similar to CDD and Binary CDD, this uptrend is only just being established, and far shallower than was seen in H1 2021. It again speaks to this inflection point in spending behaviour by older hands.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA new metric introduced to Workbench as a pre-set this week is Binary Liveliness. Borrowing concepts from Binary CDD, this metric establishes a similar oscillator to identify trends of accumulation (0) and distribution (1) using two methods:\n\nGreen: When Liveliness is higher than the 30DMA, return 1, else return 0.\nBlue: When Liveliness is higher than the prior day, return 1, else return 0 (with a 7-day moving average applied)\n\nAgain, we can observe an uptick over recent weeks confirming an appreciable increase in coin-day destruction. However, like our previous charts, it remains modest in magnitude. If the next phase of the bull market is indeed in place, this metric can be expected to reach and maintain higher levels for weeks to months.\n\nLive Chart\nEstimating Capital Inflows\n\nWe have established that spending behaviour by more experienced investors has increased of late. The next step is to estimate the magnitude of sell-side pressure, and thus the capital inflows needed to absorb it. Whilst a large amount of trading occurs off-chain on spot and derivatives exchanges, we can layer in on-chain datasets to establish a lower-bound of capital inflows and outflows to the network.\n\nOne of the most intuitive examples of this is the Realised Cap (entity-adjusted in this case to filter out internal transfers). This metric values every coin in the supply at the price it last moved on-chain, reflecting the accumulation of net realised profits minus losses. Each time a coin is moved at a profit it will add value to the realised cap. Conversely, realised losses will subtract from it, reflecting capital outflows.\n\nThe Realised Cap has resumed an uptrend and reached an ATH of $450B, as coins are distributed, and revalued higher. This represents a net capital inflow of $50B since the previous peak in May, set during the sell-off.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOn a daily basis, the total value of coins sold at either a profit or a loss require a buyer with capital to absorb it. The chart below shows that Between $1.5B and $2.1B in total value daily is being realised by spent coins this month. Given price has largely consolidated sideways through November, we can thus estimate this as a lower bound for total capital inflow into Bitcoin.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOn a relative basis, we can then compare this total realised value to the Market Cap or the Realised Cap to normalise by market size. This establishes a simple oscillator for total capital inflow vs network valuation.\n\nPrevious market tops (namely 2017 and 2021) occurred when total value realised by spending exceeded 0.3% of the market cap, and 1.0% of the Realised Cap (often reaching much higher). In the current market, spending accounts for less than 50% of these thresholds. This provides additional evidence that a healthy bull market demand should be capable of absorbing significantly more coin distribution.\n\nLive Chart\nFinding Market Tops\n\nIdentifying Bitcoin market tops is no easy feat. However, with over a decade of on-chain and market data at our disposal, we can use tools to identify behaviours and cyclical patterns that signalled market tops in the past.\n\nThe first tool is the Mayer Multiple, calculated as a simple yet effective ratio between price, and the 200DMA. Using statistical methods, we can establish that a Mayer Multiple value of 2.4 reflects an unlikely extreme, where price has rallied to 2.4x the long-term, and well observed 200DMA. This provides an upper pricing band, currently sitting at $110k, although it will trend higher (or lower) as the 200DMA price changes.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Top Price model was originally created by Willy Woo and is an empirically fitted model, multiplying the all time Average price ($6.1k) by a factor of 35. This gives a current cycle top value of $214k. Note that the all-time-average price is much slower to change than the 200DMA, and thus the Top Price will be a less volatile top model.\n\nLive Chart\n\nNext is the battle tested MVRV Z-Score metric. Using statistical normalisation, this metric measures how many standard deviations the spot price is away from the realised price.\n\nAnother way to think about this metric is that very high values mean the market is holding large unrealised profits, and thus the incentive to sell is at a maximum. Conversely, bottoms can be found when the market is heavily underwater and investor capitulation is most likely underway. The current market is around 'half-way', after cooling off dramatically following the peak in April.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs bull markets progress, older hands continue to sell, and newer, less experienced buyers absorb the supply. Market bottoms are established when the smart money buys and HODLs a maximum of supply, and conversely, tops occur when large coin volumes have has transferred to mostly weak hand speculators.\n\nThe RHODL ratio captures this phenomena by taking the ratio between 1-week and 1-year old Realised Cap HODL wave bands. Simply put, it will peak when the number of very young coins is high relative to older coins. RHODL is consolidating at the moment, strangely similar to 2013, which suggests a stable equilibrium between 1-wk and 1-yr old coins.\n\nLive Chart\n\nLastly we have the Reserve Risk metric, a tool that is packed full of on-chain wisdom. It can be considered as follows:\n\nHigher prices increase the incentive to sell.\nEvery day a HODLer chooses not to sell, they sacrifice opportunity cost, with the expectation that prices will be higher in the future.\nWhen more HODLers choose not to sell, fewer coin-days are destroyed, and Reserve Risk will trend lower.\nAs prices rise, more HODLers will eventually reach their target sell price. As a result, more coins are sold, opportunity cost is realised, and Reserve Risk will trend higher and peak at blow-off tops.\n\nGiven the remarkable accumulation that occurred over the last 6-months, Reserve Risk is impressively low at the moment. However recently elevated CDD is starting to resume the uptrend, although with plenty of gas left in the tank.\n\nLive Chart\nProduct Updates\nReleased new workbench presets: Supply per Whale (100 - 10k BTC), Supply Delta, RVT Ratio (Entity-Adjusted), 28-day Market-Realised Gradient, 140-day Market-Realised Gradient, and Binary Liveliness\nMetric improvements for Ethereum following London hard-fork upgrade.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week Onchain (Week 45, 2021)\n\nBitcoin investor conviction appears to be at all-time-highs, alongside numerous metrics ranging from price, to hash-rate, to proportion of mature coin supply.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nNov 8, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nBitcoin has had a remarkably strong week, consolidating between $59,743 and $64,242, holding onto almost all of Octobers gains. As the Bitcoin price coils into what appears to be a very tight bull flag, the on-chain market continues to show strength in supply dynamics, whilst on-chain activity remains well below bull market highs.\n\nLong-Term Holders have distributed a very small fraction of their holdings, as is typically observed in all prior cycles. However, despite hovering just below ATHs, on-chain activity remains only marginally above bear market levels. Additionally, exchange balances continue to deplete, and miner hashrate and USD revenue are approaching new highs.\n\nThis combination of strong supply dynamics, mining network recovery, and relatively low network activity points to a fairly constructive outlook for Bitcoin over the coming weeks.\n\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nAssessing Supply Side Dynamics\n\nOnchain analysis provides us with a view over the movement of coins between investor, exchange, and other entity wallets. Generally speaking, we use a combination of coin lifespan (time since last spent), and heuristics to distinguish between experienced smart-money, and inexperienced new investors.\n\nTypical behaviour as Bitcoin prices approach ATHs is that Long-Term Holders (LTHs) (experienced investors) begin their distribution. As Bitcoin pushed to the recent ATH of $66k, supply held by LTHs also reached 'Peak HODL'. This is the point in time where they collectively owned a local maxima of the entire coin supply, 81.5% in this case.\n\nSince then, LTHs have spent 0.73% of the coin supply back into liquid circulation, providing an upper bound estimate for the degree of sell-side pressure sourced from this cohort.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis spending behaviour has even slowed down the Long-term Holder Net Position change metric, which has been in a large accumulation period since April this year. The rate of LTH accumulation reached over 400k BTC per month for around 5-months through to late-September, and has now returned to a neutral level. This indicates that over the last 30-days, LTH supply is flat on net, and an equivalent volume of coins are maturing into LTH status, as are being spent out of it.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can see similar spending behaviour in the Spent Volume Age Bands, where the dominance of coins older than 1-month has risen to 6% of total on-chain volume. Note however that levels of 6% were commonplace throughout much of 2021, and especially in Q1 where it reached over 10% as the bull market powered higher.\n\nThis metric highlights that whilst older coins are increasingly on the move, the market appears to be absorbing the sell-side without issue. Note also that bull markets can often sustain this elevated sell-side pressure for some time before topping out.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo provide a quantitative estimate of the sell-side, we can look to the revived supply metric, tracking how many coins older than 1yr are coming back into liquid circulation. Generally speaking, investors who have weathered Bitcoin volatility for 12mths, are quite likely to have a reasonable gauge of market risk, and what is considered expensive vs cheap coins.\n\nWhat we can see is that around 6.5k BTC are being revived on a daily basis at present. What is also apparent is that this is a relatively low level compared to the 2017, 2019 and 2021 bull runs where over 20k BTC were revived per day. In fact the current levels of revived supply are similar to the spending patterns throughout late 2019 to 2020 which are mostly considered a late stage bear market.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTo further drive home how relatively light the current spending is, we can review the HODL waves, filtered for coins younger than 3mths. This metric will trend higher when older coins, held by experienced investors are distributed and sold.\n\nBy definition, given the coin supply younger than 3mths is at an all-time-low of 15%, this means that coins older than 3mths are at an all-time-high of 85% of supply. Over 85% of the coin supply has remained dormant since August 2021. Investors are just not spending their coins.\n\nThe above supply dynamics paint a compelling picture of Long-term Holders hanging onto onto the vast majority of their stack. Current spending appears to be closer to taking strategic profits, rather than a market wide exit due to a belief that these prices are expensive.\n\nLive Chart\nAssessing Demand Dynamics\n\nThe demand dynamics in a bull market tend to come in two phases:\n\nSmart money accumulation (pre-ATH), where on-chain activity is low, supply dynamics remain constructive, and most spending looks like strategic profits being taken.\nHype and euphoria (post-ATH), as media coverage of the asset increases, retail trader interest rises, and on-chain activity starts to climb. Older, more experienced hands generally increase their distribution from this point onwards.\n\nBoth the sell-side supply dynamics described above, and the demand dynamics that follow, both speak strongly to current market characteristics still being of the first phase: smart money accumulation, albeit closer to the transition out of this phase.\n\nThe first evidence of this is exchange net flows, which continue to demonstrate a remarkable dominance of outflows. Outflows have accelerated this week, reaching over 5k BTC in net withdrawals on a daily basis.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs a result of continued exchange outflows, the aggregate BTC exchange balance has fallen to multi-year lows of 12.9% of circulating supply. Even as Bitcoin consolidates below ATHs, exchange reserves continue to deplete.\n\nLive Chart\n\nMeanwhile, on-chain activity is recovering, albeit very slowly, and certainly far below historical examples of Hype and Euphoria as in 2017 and Q1 2021. Transaction counts remain well below the peaks seen in the first half of 2021, currently around 225k transactions/day. This is coincident with levels seen throughout the 2019-20 bear market.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA very similar pattern can be seen in the number of new on-chain entities observable in the onchain transaction space. A very modest uptrend is in play with new entities hitting 110k per day. Again, this is barely above levels sustained throughout the 2019-20 bear market, where activity was between 90k and 110k new entities per day.\n\nThis observation of prices near ATHs, whilst on-chain activity is near bear market lows is quite a remarkable divergence. It speaks to a convincing case where the market is likely still in the quiet accumulation phase, punctuated by low activity, large exchange outflows, and very modest strategic spending by experienced holders.\n\nLive Chart\nWeekly Feature: Mining Market Recovery\n\nThe mining industry continues to recover after the extraordinary event of 52% of the hash-power network dropping offline, almost overnight. On a 7-day MA basis, hash-rate declined from 176 EH/s to 84EH/s during the second half of May.\n\nThis decline of 92 EH/s was equivalent to the entire hash-power of the network up to October 2019. Since the low in early June, hash-rate has recovered by 95% to reach 164 EH/s. Given the current recovery trend, the mining market hash-rate could very well reach new ATHs before the end of 2021.\n\nLive Chart\n\nMiner revenues denominated in BTC are well know to decline dramatically every four years, as the block subsidy component is programatically halved. With transaction fees included, the current aggregate miner revenue fluctuates between 900 and 1,000 BTC per day.\n\nThere remains an ongoing debate regarding whether these halving events are likely to adversely affect protocol security long term. We won't analyse this fully here, but the following charts offer some commentary on the current trend and state of play.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWhilst miner incomes are denominated in BTC, their incurred costs of hardware, logistics, power and financing are denominated in fiat currency. Whilst the block subsidy is indeed at the lowest level in history, miner revenues in fiat currency are anything but.\n\nSince the halving event in May 2020, USD aggregate revenues are up over 550%, rising from $9.3M/day to over $60M/day. In fact daily revenue is almost at all-time highs, off by just 5% from the peak of $67M/day set in May. This means the mining industry is being paid almost at the highest level in history for their services.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOne approach to assess the total aggregate investment into the Bitcoin mining industry is via the Thermocap, a metric that calculates a cumulative sum of all USD value block rewards since genesis. The assumption is that miners are rational, profit motivated actors, and will thus invest up to $99.99 to win a reward of $100.\n\nThe Bitcoin Thermocap is technically always at ATH, but its growth has accelerated alongside rising price lately to reach $32.8B. In the approx 18mths since the May 2020 halving, the Thermocap has grown by 93%, up a total of $15.8B. In other words, 93% of all USD denominated security budget has been issued in the last 18mths, even after the latest halving event.\n\nWith Bitcoin hash-rate almost fully recovered from a 52% decline, miner USD revenues near ATHs, and 93% of the security budget issued in the last 1.5yrs, the Bitcoin security and incentives system appears to be functioning exceptionally well.\n\nSuch a simple protocol design, with simply extraordinary results.\n\nProduct Updates\nAdded cummean & cumstd functions to Workbench\nAdded community charts as Workbench pre-sets.\nIssued updated Academy entries for Realised Profit, Net Realised Profit/Loss, NVT Ratio and NVT Signal\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

That mark of +40% is the highest single month of gains for BTC since December 2020. In fact, the total price range of Octobers monthly price candle (including wicks) was $23,205, larger in USD value than Bitcoin's entire price range from genesis to December 2020.\n\nLive chart\n\nBitcoin hasn't been the only performer— Ethereum also made a new all-time high this week of $4,455, eclipsing the previous high water mark of $4,362 set on May 12.\n\nLive Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nProfit and Spending Levels Are Muted\n\nWhen new highs are made, the behavior of holders and the profit-taking activity of investors can inform us about the health, and sentiment of the market. SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) is the profitability of spent Bitcoin relative to the realised value on a daily basis. Here we ignore coins younger than 1-hour by employing Adjusted SOPR (aSOPR), to filter out day trading noise and relay transactions.\n\nThe current levels of spent profit taking on-chain are mild considering the all-time high was broken ten days ago, and resemble the activity of an early bull market. It appears that current holders are by and large unwilling to move their coins here, and are waiting for higher prices. Positive aSOPR during consolidation or upwards price action is constructive as it suggests the market can absorb the sell-side whilst maintaining price support levels.\n\nLive chart\n\nA lot of attention is paid to the Long-Term Holders, but their high time preference counterparts (the Short-Term Holders) can also inform us about market conditions. The standing profit level of Short-Term Holders (STH) over time is a reliable bellwether for bull/bear sentiment as STH often represent the marginal buyer/seller.\n\nIn the chart below:\n\nValues over 1 (green zones) indicate that Short-Term Holders are stepping in to buy when price nears their cost basis, observed by a bounce off the black line. Sellers are finding liquidity and newer holders are holding coins at break-even or in profit.\nValues below 1 (red zones) show periods where Short-Term Holders in the aggregate are holding coins at a loss. When the black line acts as overhead resistance, it means the Short-Term Holder group is unable to pull themselves into a state of profit.\nLive chart\n\nAnother perspective of on-chain profitability is via the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss metric (NUPL), filtered below to include only Long-Term Holders (LTH). This is the total standing profit level of all entities that have been holding coins for at least 155 days.\n\nThe NUPL zone between 0.50 and 0.75 (meaning LTH are sitting on 50-75% net profit) has historically been a pivot spot for the market. When LTH test this zone and stand firm by not selling, price tends to rally higher in the following weeks and months.\n\nThis dynamic played out in the 2013-14 double run bull market, and also in 2017. In 2019, Long-Term Holders failed to hold and capitulated. Here again in 2021, Long-Term Holder NUPL is looking for support out of this key zone. In each previous instance where LTH-NUPL exited this zone higher, price was breaking the all-time high.\n\nLive chart\nLeveraged Long Traders Take Losses\n\nWith the launch of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF in the same week as all-time highs, activity in the futures market has been heavy and bustling. Although the ETF exists in the traditional expiring contracts market, activity has also been volatile in perpetual swaps where the funding rate governs premium rates.\n\nA positive funding rate means that longs (betting on price to rise) have an imbalance of leverage to their side, and those traders pay a premium to shorts for the privilege of keeping their positions open. Divergences between funding bias and price can highlight risks for traders taking the other side, especially when open interest is elevated.\n\nIf funding is positive and price continues to rise, then the premium is aligned with sentiment, and is the cost of doing business.\nIf funding is positive and price goes sideways/down, leveraged long traders betting against price are uniquely vulnerable to liquidations.\n\nThe chart below shows moments of price weakness (red arrows) following rises in funding (blue arrows), and the subsequent de-leveraging (orange arrows) that occurs when losing positions are closed out. At the moment, funding rates are declining alongside price, suggesting that leveraged traders are taking a more cautious approach, which is a healthier position for the market by and large.\n\nLive chart\n\nLarger amounts of long liquidations tend to follow moments of high positive funding that are met with sideways or declining price. In turn, cascading short liquidations can occur when negative funding rates (indicating an abundance of short leverage) meet rising price.\n\nIn the chart below, the red arrows from the funding rate chart above have been carried over, demonstrating the liquidation waves that follow divergences between funding and price. Of note are the $3.5 million in long liquidations that occurred hourly after the ATH break on October 21-22. Some traders went long immediately upon reaching price discovery and were quickly swatted down.\n\nCoincident with our funding rate observation above, liquidations have slowed down in the last few days, suggesting leveraged traders are taking more care with their positions and exposure.\n\nLive chart\n\nThe last futures related chart we'll peek at today is the percentage of crypto-margined futures, declining precipitously since the spring 2021 highs. Futures contracts can be collateralized in two ways: crypto or cash.\n\nCash-margined futures are placed with cash or cash equivalents, like stablecoins pegged to the US dollar. These tend to be more stable collateral assets than their crypto counterparts.\nCrypto-margined futures are placed with crypto assets like Bitcoin. In these contracts, a trader's risk and collateral are based on the same asset, thus the same volatility (i.e. BTC). If both the position and hedge are losing value, a trader has little wiggle room before liquidations set in, compounding risk but multiplying the potential reward.\n\nSince the fervour of the spring 2021 bull run, crypto-margined futures contracts have been on the decline, falling from an average around 66-69% down to 46% today. This means that over half (54%) of futures contracts presently are margined with cash or cash equivalents, reducing the effects of compounded volatility.\n\nLive chart\nSupply and Network Dynamics Look Bullish\n\nThe RVT Ratio, initially presented by Glassnode's own Checkmate, aims to compare the dollar value transferred on the network to its relative valuation. As an on-chain to on-chain ratio, RVT offers a consistent and reliable oscillator for bull/bear cycles. We look at it here as one of our recently released Community Workbench charts.\n\nLower RVT values mean transfer volume USD, and thus network usage, is growing relative to Realized Cap (the network's on-chain cost basis). This can be interpreted as a bullish signal.\nHigher RVT values means that network transfer volume is lower in relation to Bitcoin's realized value (Realized Cap), suggesting that network valuation is outpacing its demand utility. This is typically a bearish signal.\n\nThe RVT Ratio is currently trading at relatively historic lows, which indicates that the transaction volume throughput of the network is quite high relative to the value 'stored' in Bitcoin, and is a macro bullish signal.\n\nLive chart\n\nSupply dynamics are frequently a leading indicator of shifting HODLer sentiment. As prices pushes to new highs, older coins come back to life, seeking exit liquidity to realize profits. The Spent Volume Age Bands (SVAB), filtered below to show only spent coins older than 1-month, have ticked up recently into bullish territory (>6% of daily volume). This follows a September which saw some of the quietest activity for this cohort in recent history (<2% of daily volume).\n\nLive chart\n\nTo corroborate the increased daily spent volume of coins older than 1-month, we look to Average Spent Output Lifespan (ASOL)— the average age of all spent outputs over time, ignoring volume. Likewise to the bullish spike in SVAB we just mentioned, ASOL has seen an uptick over the 40-day average line, which typically aligns with price volatility in either direction.\n\nLive chart\n\nWhen combining the observations of increased old coin activity with the muted levels of profit-taking covered earlier, a bullish on-chain portrait is being painted. If Bitcoin can maintain an environment of low selling, price may find itself back in price discovery before long.\n\nProduct Updates\nAdded cummean & cumstd functions to Workbench\nAdded community charts as Workbench pre-sets.\nImprovements to Binance exchange data.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nVisit Glassnode Forum for long-form discussions and analysis.\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week Onchain (Week 43, 2021)\n\nBitcoin rallies to new ATHs alongside the launch of the first futures backed ETF. Long-term Holders are taking modest profits, however are slowing spending during the dip.\n\nCheckmate\nOct 25, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nBitcoin has rallied to new all-time-highs this week, following the launch of the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (Ticker $BITO). The market pushed above Aprils previous ATH ($64,717) to reach a new peak of $66,928. The market has since corrected, putting in a weekly low of $59,722.\n\nThe BITO ETF surpassed $1.1B in assets under management in the first two days of trading, outpacing an 18-yr record set by the $GLD Gold ETF. As the underlying of the BITO ETF are Bitcoin futures trading on the CME exchange, this week we will analyse the explosive growth in open interest and volume in CME markets.\n\nWe also continue our assessment of long-term holder spending behaviour, which appears to be slowing down as conviction returns during this pullback. We finish our analysis with the introduction of new metrics and pricing models developed by our community of analysts. These have all been added to Workbench as pre-sets.\n\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nBitcoin Futures Backed ETF Launches\n\nThe headline news in the industry last week was the launch of the BITO ETF product which utilises CME futures contracts as the underlying. Open interest in CME contracts has exploded higher through October, rising by $3.95 Billion (265%). This set a new a new all-time-high of $5.44B for futures open interest on the CME exchange.\n\nLive Chart\n\nTrading volume also peaked at a new high of $7.66B on the 20 October, the day of the current price ATH. Traders moved an additional $490M worth of volume on CME futures relative to the previous peak set in Feb 2021.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFunding rates in perpetual swap futures markets also reached a new local high on the same day prices reached the $66k. This signalled that many traders were opening leveraged long positions amidst the excitement of the rally and ETF launch. As often happens during periods of exuberance and high leverage, prices quickly corrected, flushing out excess leverage, hitting stop-losses and returning funding rates to lower levels.\n\nNote that funding rates remain at similar levels as observed just prior to the early September flush out. With futures open interest remaining near all time highs, a risk of further downside to clear even more leverage does remain in play.\n\nLive Chart\n\nLastly on derivatives markets, and in a more constructive light, the proportion of futures margin collateralised by volatile crypto assets has continue to decline. Crypto-margined futures contracts have fallen from 70.1% in April (on the Coinbase direct listing), to 44.6% today.\n\nThe converse of this observation is that stablecoin or fiat collateral is now posted for 55.4% of futures open interest (vs 29.9% in April). This is a much healthier state of leverage across the market, where price volatility in the posted collateral is gradually declining in favor of stable value assets, and fiat currency.\n\nLive Chart\nOld Coins On The Move\n\nLast week we covered the very early signs of older coins, reflecting more experienced long-term holders (LTHs), being spent and taking profits. This is typical behaviour around new price ATHs, and after another week of price action, we can reassess the state of this trend.\n\nLong-Term Holder supply declined by around 39.5k BTC over the last two weeks. However when we look at this in context, it follows a period of incredible accumulation and HODLing, where LTH held supply increased by 2.42M BTC since the lows in March.\n\nCurrent LTH supply is 680k BTC higher than it was this time last year, and even after the weeks spending, is starting to reverse back to the upside. This observation suggests perhaps LTH distribution has so far been more of an 'event', than a trend.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe can see the magnitude of lifespan destroyed by these older coins on the move in the Dormancy metric. Dormancy presents the average number of coin-days (lifespan) destroyed per unit of BTC spent that day. General interpretation is:\n\nHigher values mean older average age and typically indicates old coins are being distributed (typical in bull markets)\nLower values mean the average age of coins is relatively young and is typical of bear markets and accumulation periods.\n\nA pre-bull market Dormancy baseline of around 50-days was established throughout 2019-20. This gives us a reference point for what constitutes accumulation vs distribution. Incredibly, the accumulation from May through September shows up as extremely low Dormancy values, getting below 25-days in mid-September (strong accumulation signal). There has been a slight uptick in this metric over the last two weeks, however it continues to trade around the pre-bull baseline of 50-days, suggesting LTH spending is modest, but not extreme.\n\nLive Chart\n\nA similar pattern can be observed in the Binary Coin-days Destroyed metric which is beginning to trade higher on a 7-day average basis. This is again very similar to the behaviour observed in prior bull markets where LTHs commence distribution around new price ATHs. A similar pattern is observable from October 2020 to Jan 2021 during the rally from $10k to $42k.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Realised Cap HODL waves confirm the above observations as younger coin bands (warmer colours) have seen a slight uplift. As older coins are spent, a larger realised value of coins move into these younger bands, and older bands will shrink proportionally.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Short-Term Holder SOPR metric has also signalled a return of conviction, with a reset back to a value of 1.0. SOPR reflects the aggregate profitability of coins spent that day, with values greater than 1.0 signalling net profits, and less than 1.0 net losses.\n\nSTHs tend to be the marginal buyers and sellers, and STH-SOPR often signals support (in bull) and resistance (in bears) when it resets back to a value of 1.0. This indicates that both profitable, and loss holding coins remain dormant and signifies a return of conviction. In a bull market, SOPR resets offers a reasonable case for the lows of a correction, even if only for a shorter term bounce.\n\nOverall, a handful of Long-Term Holders have started spending their coins to realise profits and is showing up in elevated destroyed lifespan metrics. However, the uplift in Dormancy and Binary CDD remain fairly small relative to prior bull cycle distributions, and even STHs have stopped spending during this correction. With LTH supply already starting to recover, the most likely interpretation is that the vast majority of coin holders are still expecting and waiting for higher prices.\n\nWeekly Feature: Community Workbench Charts\n\nWe are pleased to have released a suite of pre-set charts to Workbench that are constructed and shared by our community of analysts.\n\nThe first is the Top Cap model which was invested by the grandfather of on-chain analytics himself, @woonomic. This model applies a multiple of 35 to the all-time average price of Bitcoin to establish a cycle top model which has picked all four prior macro market tops.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe second is the Illiquid Supply Shock (ISS) Ratio proposed by @WClementeIII. Where coins are primarily flowing out of liquid circulation, the ISS Ratio will trend higher suggesting increased probability of a supply shock. Conversely, downtrends in ISS Ratio will occur as illiquid coins are spent back into liquid circulation, reducing the probability of a supply shock.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe Realised Price to Liveliness Ratio (RPLR) was introduced by @dorinvesting, which modifies the Realised Price using Liveliness. By taking the ratio between the two, a 'fair value' model for Bitcoin can be established that accounts for periods of time where HODLing, or spending dominates investor behaviour.\n\nWhere more HODLing is taking place, more coin-days are created, Liveliness trends towards zero, and RPLR fair value is estimated higher.\nWhere less HODLing is taking place, more coin-days are destroyed, Liveliness trends towards unity, and RPLR fair value is estimated lower.\nLive Chart\n\nLastly, we have the Bitcoin Price Temperature, crafted by @dilutionproof and is used to establish a mean reversion model based on the cyclical nature of Bitcoin investment and halving cycles. It provides both an oscillator, and pricing bands for assessing which price levels coincide with fair-value, or extreme outlier standard deviation multiples.\n\nLive Chart\n\nWe want to thank our community analysts who continue to release insightful and pioneering work in the discipline of on-chain and market analysis. We look forward to seeing and integrating many more community Workbench creations\n\nForum Product Release\n\nLast week, we are proud to have launched Glassnode Forum, available for our Advanced and Professional accounts.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week Onchain (Week 42, 2021)\n\nBitcoin breaks above $60k and approaches its all-time price high. Long-Term Holders begin to realise modest profits as Options volumes explode higher.\n\nCheckmate\nOct 18, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nIt has been an exciting week for Bitcoin investors as the SEC approves the first Bitcoin futures backed ETF product. The market continued to rally on the news from a low of $54,370 to a high of $62,503. At the weekly peak, prices were within $2,214 of the current all-time-high at $64,717.\n\nThe excitement in the market can be seen across a number of indicators and metrics, both in the on-chain spending patterns, and in derivatives markets. This week we explore what looks to be early signs of Long-term Holders realising profits, growing leverage in derivatives markets, and an explosion in options volume and open interest. The bulls are buying call options en mass, with preferred strike prices above $100k through to the end of the year.\n\nForum Product Release\n\nLast week, we are proud to have launched Glassnode Forum, available for our Advanced and Professional accounts. Forum provides a venue to share ideas, discuss analysis and research, and connect with the brightest minds in on-chain and market analytics in long-form conversation.\n\nHead over to Forum at forum.glassnode.com and read the User Guide here.\nRead out Forum User Guide\nLong-Term Holders Start Realising Profits\n\nTo set the stage, we will begin to the URPD metric which presents the distribution of prices at which the circulating supply was last spent on-chain. At the time of writing, only 311.8k BTC were last moved at higher prices. Note also that the owners of these coins HODLed throughout all the ups, downs and volatility of the last 6 months and did not sell.\n\nWith only 1.66% of the supply held at an unrealised loss, this means 98.34% of coins are now held at an unrealised profit.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs the market pushes towards the ATH, and investors hold increasingly large unrealised profits, the incentive to sell is growing.\n\nWe recently released an article which explores the macro cyclical behaviour of Bitcoins strongest hands: the Long-Term Holders (LTH). These entities are classified as owners of coins that have been held for ~155-days or longer and are generally considered as the 'Bitcoin smart money'.\n\nTypical on-chain behaviour of LTHs can be summarised as buying low (accumulation in a bear) and selling high (selling into bullish strength). The trend of LTHs increasing their spending of coins usually coincides with price breaking the previous ATH. Thus it is expected that this trend or more old coin spending will start to develop as market prices trade higher.\n\nOver the past week, we can see a slight softening of the LTH net position change metric. This suggests a degree of LTH spending is occurring as prices rally above $60k.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThis spending behaviour has flowed into the Realised Cap HODL waves. This metric reflects the proportional realised value of coins categorised into age brackets.\n\nHere we can see that the downtrend in young coins (< 1-month), which had persisted since February, has experienced a slight uptick this week. When younger coin bands thicken up, it can only be a result of older coins being spent, destroying their accumulated lifespan and, and assumed to be changing hands.\n\nLive Chart\n\nAs volumes pick back up in the on-chain transaction space, we can again revisit the Binary Coin-days Destroyed metric. This metric has a 7-day moving average applied and is very useful for identifying trends of older coins being spent. General interpretation of this metric is:\n\nLow Sideways Values: Accumulation as old coins remain dormant\nUptrends: As older coins are spent, usually distributing into market strength\nDowntrends: After market peaks as owners of older coins slow their spending and prepare for accumulation.\n\nThis week has seen a very early sign of an uptick on older spending, confirming that more coin-days were destroyed than the long term average. That said, bullish markets can often absorb many months of such distribution behaviour as is observed in all previous cycles.\n\nLive Chart\n\nUsing the Workbench tool, we can establish the BTC volume that has been spent, both realising losses and realising profits. The chart below plots out the 90-day sum of realised profits (green) and realised losses (red), both denominated in BTC.\n\nMarked out are key macro shifts in sentiment and direction, such as market tops, and capitulation bottoms. Over the past 90-days, a total of 1.63M BTC worth of profits, and 676k BTC in losses have been realised (total of 2.3M BTC). Note that the realised profits metric remains significantly below the market tops in 2018 (5.99M BTC), 2019 (2.50M BTC) and most recently in Q2 2021 (4.58M BTC).\n\nWorkbench Chart\n\nThe Realised Profits-to-Value Ratio (RPV) shows the scale of these realised profits to the market on-chain cost basis (Realised cap).\n\nIn other words, this metric compares the magnitude of profitable volume spent on-chain (assumed sell pressure), to the value that investors have stored in Bitcoin (sum of all coin value at the price when it was last spent).\n\nCompared to previous market tops and bull markets, the current spending is relatively insignificant compared to the network valuation. Whilst we have now confirmed that profitable coins are on the move, these metrics indicate that current demand is sufficient to absorb any sell-side pressure applied.\n\nLive Chart\n\nFinally, closing out our investigation into on-chain market structure, we can look to the Exchange Net Position change metric to see if these coins are flowing into exchanges for sale. What we can see is that after an extended period of sustained outflows, the on-net change in exchange balances has returned neutral.\n\nThis suggests that over the last 30-days, inflows have been matched with outflows which further indicates that there is sufficient demand at present to absorb the sell-side. It does however indicate fewer coins are being withdrawn and is obviously less constructive for price than net outflows.\n\nInterestingly, this market structure is very similar to the period in late 2020 as Bitcoin approached last cycles $20k ATH. All in all, the market remains quite bullish, however it is likely that this early signal of older coins, owned by LTHs being spent on-chain will continue as it has in all previous Bitcoin cycles.\n\nLive Chart\nDerivatives Explode Higher\n\nThe derivatives markets for Bitcoin have seen marked increases in open interest and volume, particularly in the options space. Options open interest expanded by a remarkable +107% ($6.3B) over the course of October alone. Whilst not an all-time-high, it is not all that far away.\n\nLive Chart\n\nOptions trade volume has similarly seen an extraordinary week, rising up to $1.5B as Bitcoin prices breached the $60k price level. Options trade volume has only reached levels this high on three prior occasions, all at similar price points between March and May this year.\n\nLive Chart\n\nThe favoured options contracts appear to be call options with strike prices above $100k, with a typical open interest of $250M to $350M for call options expiring at the end of the year. The open interest in call options dwarfs that in put options, aligning with the overall bullish market sentiment.\n\nLive Chart\n\nIn futures markets, open interest has climbed, although certainly not to the same relative rate as in the options space. The chart below shows perpetual futures open interest denominated in BTC to help isolate open interest growth, from the influence of the coin price.\n\nOpen interest in perpetual markets is currently around 225k BTC which is coincident with a number or periods that preceded leverage flush outs. Primary examples are April, May and September local tops which were all followed by cascading long liquidations. However a similarly high level of open interest was seen in July before shorts were squeezed out at the $29k bottom.\n\nLive Chart\n\nDespite futures open interest approaching ATHs, the volume traded appears to be declining on a macro scale, and has been since the sell-off in May. In a high open interest but low volume environment, it could set the stage for heightened probabilities for a liquidation cascade, as volumes may be insufficient to support the flush out once it gets going.\n\nWhilst the market at large remains relatively healthy, and demand is meeting LTH sell-side, exercising some caution given the elevated leverage across both futures and options markets is likely prudent.\n\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week Onchain (Week 41, 2021)\n\nUnderlying on-chain fundamentals continue to paint a bullish picture for Bitcoin, as leverage and futures premiums increase in derivatives markets.\n\nCheckmate, TXMC, Glassnode\nOct 11, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has continued to show strength this week, with prices trading within a tight consolidation range, with a low at $53,657, and a high of $56,250. Following an impressive rally from the September lows, the market has managed to hold onto the gains whilst on-chain activity has commenced a welcome climb higher.\n\nThis week we analyse the increased leveraged creeping into derivatives markets, the impressive growth of long-term holder supply, and the recent elevation of on-chain activity. Across many facets of the Bitcoin market, signals continue to paint a constructive view for prices, and market sentiment remains positive.\n\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nOn-chain Activity Climbs Higher\n\nThe first week of October has experienced a long awaited boost in network activity, increasing the probability that new demand is beginning to enter in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nActive Entities, the count of individual participants on-chain each day, has grown 19% to this week, reaching around 291k active entities per day. This value is on par with counts from late 2020 at the beginning of the last bull run. More active market participants has historically correlated with growing interest in the asset during early stage bull markets.\n\nLink to live chart\n\nAlong with an elevated number of market participants, the typical coin value of transactions has also increased. Since mid September, the median transaction size has risen to over 1.3 BTC. The last time the Bitcoin network saw a median transaction size above 1.6 BTC was March 2020 during the liquidity crash.\n\nAn increased typical transaction size is not synonymous with price appreciation, but indicative of larger and even institutional sized capital flows present on-chain. Generally speaking, periods near the end of bear markets are when smart money start to accumulate in size. These periods are often characterised by lower (but rising) on-chain activity and increasingly large transaction sizes.\n\nLink to Workbench chart\n\nThe dollar value of volume moving on-chain has also increased to meaningful levels. By viewing Transfer Volume (USD) as a percentage of the Realized Cap, we can directly compare network activity to the value 'stored' in the asset. The chart below presents 'Realized Velocity', calculated as a ratio between USD denominated on-chain transaction volume, and the Realized Cap. This gives a sense of the level of demand volume relative to the value of the coin supply valued at the time it was last spent on-chain.\n\nTransfer Volume greater than 3% of Realized Cap typically marks the beginning of a bullish market phase as network utility increases relative to realized valuation.\nTransfer Volume less than 3% of Realized Cap indicates a more bearish phase where network utility is low or declining relative to the realized valuation.\n\nTransfer Volume has once again broken above the 3% threshold suggesting growing demand for on-chain settlement of value. This is a bullish a development worth watching in the coming weeks based on its high historical signal.\n\nLink to Workbench chart\nLong-Term Holders HODL On\n\nTo further support the constructive increase on-chain activity, the supply held by Long-Term Holders (LTH) is showing no signs of slowing down. LTHs distributed coins from October 2020 through to March 20201 where their held supply bottom out at 10.91M BTC.\n\nOver the last 7-months, HODling behaviour has dominated and over 2.37M BTC have migrated across the Short-to-Long Term holder threshold (~155days). To put this into context, only 186k BTC have been freshly mined in that same period, meaning LTHs have HODLed 12.7x more coins than have been mined on average.\n\nLTH Supply Live Chart\n\nUsing the Workbench tool, we can quantify the magnitude of LTH accumulation relative to current coin issuance to miners. Here we take the ratio between the 30-day change in LTH supply (blue), and the 30-day change in circulating supply (orange, equals total issuance).\n\nThis ratio is shown in pink below and represents the multiple of monthly coin issuance that is being accumulated/HODLed (+ve) or distributed (-ve) by LTHs. February 2021 shows that LTHs distributed heavily, reaching 26.4x the number of mined coins. Conversely, June was an all-time-high of relative accumulation, reaching 27.7x issuance.\n\nSince July, LTH accumulation/HODLing has been quite consistent between 13.6 and 15.0x issuance indicating the number of coins taken out of circulation are significantly more than are being newly minted.\n\nLive Workbench Chart\n\nFurther corroborating evidence for this observation is the Revived Supply 1yr+ metric which presents the volume of 1yr+ old coins that are spent each day.\n\nDuring bull markets, it is typical to see LTHs distribute into market strength which eventually puts in a local or global top when supply overwhelms demand (uptrend, pink).\nAfter global tops are established, LTHs slow spending and await cheaper prices to recommence accumulation (downtrend, blue)\nWhen prices reach 'value zones' smart money investors start to accumulate which is characterised by low, baseline levels of revived supply as older coins remain dormant and young coins change hands (sideways, green)\n\nIn the current market structure, revived supply suggests the market remains in a relative accumulation zone, with low volumes of revived supply coming back into liquid circulation.\n\nRevived Supply Live Chart\n\nAlongside higher prices, a very large portion of the UTXO set have also returned to profit, reaching 95.7% of all UTXOs. This is an uplift of around 11.3% since the September lows. Note also that whilst the market correction since May was deep, it did not result in the proportion of UTXOs in profit falling to the extreme lows of 40% to 60% seen in the 2018-19 bear, or in March 2020. Note also that in strong bull markets, UTXOs in profit can maintain values above 90% for many months at a time.\n\nUTXOs in Profit Live chart\nLeverage Creeps Back Into Derivatives Markets\n\nThe positive sentiment and constructive price action has also started to be reflected in derivatives markets with climbing open interest, healthy contango in futures markets, and rising perpetual swap funding rates. Futures open interest has risen by $5.6B (+45%) since the lows in September. Note that this magnitude of open interest is similar to that in early September, and in mid-May, both of which preceded significant long squeezes.\n\nFutures Open Interest Live chart\n\nConstructive future prices can also be seen in the futures term structure, where the consensus price ranges across exchanges are highlighted in blue below. Through to the end of the year, traders on most exchanges (excl. Huobi) are pricing Bitcoin at approximately $58.5k (a 12.4% annualised premium). Traders on FTX and Huobi are currently the outliers for March 2022, trading at a $800 premium, and a $3.1k discount respectively, to the consensus price of around $60.1k.\n\nFutures term Structure Live chart\n\nThe 3-month annualised futures basis has also traded higher throughout October, rallying up to +12.4% this week. May-July was a particularly bearish period where futures markets were pricing in only a +2% to +5% annualised premium 3-months out. The premium in late-September returned to this +5% low and accompanied relatively bearish market sentiment. However, such relatively low futures basis has shown to be a strong indicator for a counter trend rally in 2020 and 2021.\n\nFutures 3-month Basis Live Chart\n\nPerpetual swap markets are also growing increasingly bullish over the last week, with funding rates trading between +0.01% and +0.02% across all exchanges. At the time of writing, funding rates are declining towards the lower end of this range, which suggests that perhaps traders are taking on leverage, however in a more controlled manner to previous periods. However, the probability of short-term volatility lead by a long squeeze does increase alongside elevated funding rates and climbing open interest and is a risk to pay attention to.\n\nPerpetual Funding Rate Live Chart\n\nTo close, we will look at options markets which are also seeing an expansion in open interest, rising by $3.6B (+64%) through October so far. Options markets still represent a relatively small portion of trade volume (< $1B typical), however their growth reflects a maturity of the market, providing new avenues for hedging of risk, tools for miners and traders to capture volatility premiums, and vehicles for price speculation.\n\nOptions open interest Live Chart\n\nIt is not uncommon for derivatives markets to see an influx of open interest, futures premiums, and positive funding rates alongside positive price action. Whilst this does increase the likelihood of a leverage squeeze, it must be viewed in combination with fundamental factors observed in spot markets and on-chain for a holistic view.\n\nWhat we can see is that in many regards, the current constructive price action is supported by very healthy trends in accumulation, HODLing behaviour, and increases in on-chain activity and network utilisation.\n\nNew Glassnode Content\nFollowing the Smart Money: A Study of Long-Term Holders\n\nLast week we released a new research piece exploring the on-chain HODLing behaviour and spending patterns of Bitcoins strongest hands: the Long-Term Holders.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week Onchain (Week 40, 2021)\n\nThe Bitcoin price has rallied strongly out of a zone of heavy accumulation, seeing around $1.75B worth of capital inflows per day.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nOct 4, 2021 • 7 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has rallied strongly this week, breaking out of the recent consolidation range low of $40,931, and peaking at $49,044 over the weekend. After a fairly brutal September, this rally has brought with it renewed optimism for the last quarter of 2021.\n\nSimilar to our observation during the rally in late July, a non-trivial volume of BTC changed hands during the recent consolidation trading range. We can see this via inspection of the coin volume which has now returned to holding an unrealised profit. This week we will analyse this return to profitability and how the fractals compare to previous market cycles. We will also look into the mining market which continues to recover after the Great Migration commenced in May.\n\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nReturn to Profitability\n\nIn on-chain analysis, we generally consider coins that are spent (especially for entity-adjusted variants) to have changed hands, as existing coin holders sell, and new buyers take possession. When prices consolidate in a range for an extended period, and a large volume of coins transact on-chain, this can be considered as zone of accumulation. As such we can consider this an established cost basis for many buyers.\n\nAs prices rally above this trading range this week, approximately 10.3% of the circulating supply returned to an unrealised profit. We can therefore deduce, that alongside the $29k to $40k range in May-July, the recent lows of $40k to $41k represented a significant 'value add' zone for buyers who stepped in and purchased to set a price floor. A total of 86.6% of all circulating BTC are currently held at an unrealised profit.\n\nSupply in Profit Live Chart\n\nIf we inspect the breakdown of profitability between Long- (LTH) and Short-Term (STH) Holders we can see that overall, STHs benefited the most from this rally. Around 15.6% of the BTC supply is currently held by investors who purchased within the last ~155-days and are at an unrealised profit.\n\nLTHs in profit currently hold 73.4% of the supply, leaving a remaining 11% of coins held at a loss (split 31:69 STH:LTH). As a larger portion of the market return to profit, it creates incentives for some investors to take profits, but also can recover conviction to hold onto their winners.\n\nRelative LTH-STH Supply Live Chart\n\nThe magnitude of net unrealised profit has also reached an interesting milestone, bouncing off a NUPL value of 0.5. This indicates that the total unrealised profit held in the coin supply is equivalent to approximately 50% of the market cap (approximately $450B in global unrealised gains).\n\nIf the market were to continue to trend higher and into a bullish continuation, this fractal would be similar to both the 2013 and 2017 market. In both prior cycles, a NUPL value of 0.5 acted as a 'support' level during major corrections as the market's profitability and conviction to hold was tested, bounced and subsequently rallied higher.\n\nConversely, falling below 0.5 again could potentially trigger more coin holders to spend coins in fear of seeing their unrealised profits diminish further.\n\nNUPL Live Chart\nOn-chain Spending Behaviour\n\nAs the market rallies higher, it is valuable to observe the various cohorts who are transacting on-chain to establish a case for both capital inflows, outflows, and aggregate market sentiment.\n\nThis week saw a marked decline in investors spending coins that were held at a loss. Realised losses fell to a multi-week low of around $175M per day. On the other hand, realised profits rose sharply to $996M/day. These observations are likely a function of:\n\nMore coins returning to profit overall (discussed above)\nProfits taken by traders who bought the recent lows\nInvestors who may have bought the March-May top 'getting their money back' closer to, or just above their cost basis.\n\nGiven the market continued to hold most of the weeks gains, this also indicates that around $1.75B worth of capital is flowing into the market as buy side demand per day.\n\nRealised PnL Live Chart\n\nThe structural downtrend on old coin volume dominance continues this week, reaching a multi-year low of around 2%. In the pre-bull phase of 2019-20, old coin volume represented around 4% of all volume moved on-chain as a baseline. This spiked in late 2020 and early 2021 as long term investors took profits in the bull market.\n\nWith old coin dominance at multi-year lows, is suggests two dynamics are at play:\n\nOld Hands have strong conviction and are not spending at current prices.\nYoung coin dominance is at multi-year highs which indicates the same liquid supply is transacting and likely being absorbed by new buyers (as noted in net capital inflows from the previous chart).\nSpent Volume Age Bands Live Chart\n\nBreaking down the on-chain volume by transaction size, we can also see that very large transaction sizes ($10M+) continue to dominate. Overall entity-adjusted transaction volumes have largely returned to the peak of between $13.6B and $16.8B per day. The rising dominance of large transaction sizes hints to the increased maturation of Bitcoin as a macro scale asset with increasing interest from high net worth individuals, trading desks, and institutions.\n\nTransaction Breakdown by Size Live Chart\n\nOn the spending behaviour of Long-term Holders, the overall profitability of spent coins has fallen to relatively low levels. LTH-SOPR has returned to a value of 2.0 which indicates that spent coins have a profit multiple of around 200% (i.e. aggregate cost basis of $24k for coins spent at $48k).\n\nAs a longer term cyclical metric, the LTH-SOPR usually trades in this range during late stage bear markets, and early stage bull markets. This is a result of lengthy sideways price action which compresses profit multiples, even for longer-term investors.\n\nLTH-SOPR Live Chart\n\nFor Short-Term Holders, we also have relatively constructive signals, with the STH-SOPR metric rallying back into profitability. In bullish market structure, a return of STH-SOPR to a value of 1.0 generally suggests:\n\nSTHs have stopped taking profits, else the metric would trend higher. This suggests conviction to hold remains.\nSome STHs are panic selling and realising losses, often pushing STH-SOPR slightly below 1 during price pull-backs.\n\nAs a result, a SOPR value of 1.0 usually indicates market support, which in this case has played out. A return to profitability alongside positive or sustained price action indicates that sufficient demand is present to absorb spent coins, providing confluence to many of the charts discussed above.\n\nSTH-SOPR Live Chart\nWeekly Feature: Mining Recovery\n\nThe Bitcoin mining industry experienced the most dramatic short term disruption in all history, with over 50% of the network hash-power coming offline throughout May. Despite this massive impact to its industrial base, the Bitcoin hash-power network has been on a consistent path to recovery every since.\n\nAfter bottoming out in late July, protocol mining difficulty has risen by 39%, with a further additional upwards adjustment of around 3.9% expected this week. Mining difficulty has now returned to last 2020 levels, requiring around 80 sextillion hashes to solve a block (that is 8 followed by 22 zeros!).\n\nDifficulty Live Chart\n\nThe Difficulty ribbon is also about to flip over and signal full recovery, as the slowest 200-day moving average crosses over the fastest 9-day moving average. The only comparable difficulty ribbon flip to the current market was following the December 2018 bear market capitulation event that took prises down 50% to $3k.\n\nThe 2018-19 mining recovery took a total of 164-days to completely reverse the bearish difficulty ribbon signal. The current market has been in recovery for 120-days and is likely to complete the flip after the next upwards difficulty adjustment.\n\nDifficulty Ribbon Live Chart\n\nFinally, we can look to miner total revenues to assess overall income for the mining industry. Despite a 50% reduction in the block-subsidy from 12.5 BTC/block to 6.25 BTC/block in May 2020, total USD miner revenue is up significantly.\n\nRemember, miners have CAPEX (hardware, facilities, logistics) and OPEX (power, personnel, maintenance etc) costs that are denominated in fiat currencies. Comparing the current aggregate mining income of $40M per day to revenues observed around the 2020 halving event, we can see that miner revenues are up:\n\n+275% since the pre-halving period of $14M to $18M/day\n+630% compared to the post-halving period of $6M to $8M/day\n\nDespite dramatic shifts in the mining market, multiple deep price corrections, and a halving event in May 2020, the Bitcoin block reward value continues to rise, creating incentives for the market to adapt, innovate and recover. Quite incredible really.\n\nMining Revenue Live Chart\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nReleased Lightning metrics and dashboard.\nReleased New metrics Investor Cap, STH Profit/Loss Ratio, Realised Profits to Value Ratio, Seller Exhaustion Constant and STH-LTH Realised Value Ratio\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week Onchain (Week 39, 2021)\n\nExploring the bull and bear cases for the current market structure, as well as a deep dive into our new Lightning Network metrics.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nSep 27, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market experienced volatile downside price action this week, opening at $47,328 on Monday and sliding to a low of $39,876. The sell-off comes alongside continued pressure on the industry from regulators, a sell-off in equities markets, challenging conditions in Chinese debt markets, and yet another Bitcoin ban in China.\n\nAlongside this uncertainty, the week was full of exciting and positive news related to both El Salvador's adoption, and Twitter's implementation of the Bitcoin Lightning Network. We are also excited to release a suite of Lightning Network charts and dashboards to track the performance and adoption of the LN protocol.\n\nIn this week's newsletter, we will explore both the bull and bear sides of the current market conditions on-chain, as well as a deep dive into our new Lightning Network metrics.\n\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nOnly the HODLers Remain\n\nThe relatively low utilisation of Bitcoin block-space has been widely discussed of late, with a case to be made on both sides as to whether it is bullish, bearish, or both:\n\nBull case is that it is a result of growing adoption of efficient transaction techniques such as SegWit, transaction batching, and usage of Lightning Network.\nBear case is that the 50%+ correction in May resulted in a flushing out of many retail traders and investors, and thus interest in the protocol has waned since early 2021.\nThe most likely case is both of these are in effect.\n\nThe chart below shows that transaction counts have indeed declined since May, returning to what could be considered a 'bearish onchain activity channel'. Higher transaction counts are characteristic of bullish conditions as new entrants swarm into the network and demand for block-space increases accordingly. Conversely, lower transaction demand can signal fewer market participants are active, and less relative interest in the asset.\n\nTransaction counts are currently at around 175k to 200k transactions per day which are similar to levels seen in the 2018 bear market.\n\nTransaction Counts (EA) Live Chart\n\nAs exchanges increasingly deploy transaction batching techniques (processing multiple client withdrawals in a single transaction), transaction counts alone can be misleading. Thus we must also assess the number of active on-chain entities.\n\nWe can see however, that a very similar pattern is in play which speaks to the more bearish case of reduced participation being a dominant driver. This adds weight to the argument that the market may be dominated by HODLers and traders, with less participation by newer entrants and retail speculators.\n\nActive Entities Live Chart\n\nWe can confirm this by looking at the Entities Net Growth metric which describes the difference between new on-chain entrants (holding new coins), and those leaving the network (spending all their coins). Here we can see with each market cycle a rising 'floor value' of new entities. This describes Bitcoin reaching a wider audience over time, and the size of the consistently buying HODLer base. We can also see that bull markets experience a steep increase in new participants, many of which slow-down after market tops.\n\nThe current market has returned to the upper bound of the 2018-20 bear market baseline, of around 13k new entities per day.\n\nEntities Net Growth Live Chart\n\nThe assessment we can take away from this, is that the highest likelihood is that the majority of today's market participants, are longer-term HODLers and accumulators. The question is, can they hold the line and provide sufficient buy support?\n\nIf we look to the percent entities in profit, we can make two observations:\n\nAround 9.6% of entities hold coins, that were accumulated during August and September, and are now underwater (held at an unrealised loss). This represents a 58% retracement of the August high, suggesting a non-trivial number of buyers from May-July took profits on the way up.\nThis fractal is remarkably similar to the July-October recovery after the March 2020 sell-off.\n\nWe also see this March 2020 recovery fractal in the Short-term Holder MVRV. This metric will trade at 1.0 when price is equal to the onchain cost basis of STHs. After a capitulation event (MVRV < 1.0) and relief rally (MVRV > 1.0), STHs who accumulated on the way up are having their conviction to hold tested.\n\nPrices have returned to the cost basis of short-term holders. Given we estimated ~58% of them are already underwater, the key question is whether these buyers from August and September will sell their coins at a loss and drive prices lower. The other question is whether the HODLers who remain can provide enough buy side support if they do?\n\nSTH-MVRV Live Chart\nConviction to HODL\n\nTo answer the second half of this question, we assess the conviction to HODL by existing coin holders amidst fairly historic volatility (and many rolls of the FUD dice).\n\nWe start with the Coin-days Destroyed 90 metric (CDD-90) which calculates the cumulative sum of lifespan spent over the last 90-days. This metric will peak when large volumes of old coins are spent (usually in bull markets), and decline during periods of accumulation and HODLing.\n\nCDD-90 is currently trading at very low levels of around 150k CDD. This level is coincident with periods of large scale accumulation, including both early bull markets, and later stage bear markets.\n\nCDD-90 Live Chart\n\nWe can also see that the relative supply held by Short-term Holders has reached an all-time low of 20% of circulating supply. This is a rare occurrence that has historically described the late stage accumulation periods of bear markets by the smarter money.\n\nRelative STH-LTH Supply PNL Live Chart\n\nThis also manifests as a multi-year low in Highly Liquid supply, a metric that has returned to December 2018 levels. Highly liquid coins are those that are located on exchanges and other venues where coins can trivially change hands with the click of a button.\n\nLiquid and Illiquid Supply Live Chart\n\nWe can confirm this downtrend is influenced by the withdrawal of coins from exchanges, which continues at a significant rate. The exchange net position change metric demonstrates a clear change in character and market preference following March 2020. The market shifted from a regime of dominant inflows, to one of outflows. July to September has been a historically significant period of net outflows, ranging between 80k and 100k BTC/month.\n\nExchange Net Position Change\n\nAs coins migrate out of highly liquid exchange balances, and into investor wallets, they start to mature. Initially, these coins are likely to be re-spent in response to market volatility, but over time, the are increasingly considered illiquid, dormant, and more likely to remain in cold storage. These transitional coins are referred to as Liquid supply which we can see has been in macro decline since 2016.\n\nIf we consider the total supply of Highly Liquid and Liquid coins, we have 3.117M (HL) + 1.229M (L) = 4.346M BTC freely circulating (~23% of circulating supply).\n\nLiquid and Illiquid Supply Live Chart\n\nThe converse of the above charts is that Long-term holders now hold an all-time-high of over 80% of circulating BTC. Of note in the 2021 cycle, is the relatively small distribution of coins that occurred in the Q1-2021 bull compared to previous cycles. LTH supply drew down to only 67.7% of supply where previous cycles were between 54% and 58%.\n\nWe can also note the speed of the recovery which indicates that 12.3% of the circulating supply was accumulated in the 2020-21 bull market, and remains unspent today.\n\nDespite relatively low on-chain activity, and a number of market fractals resembling bearish conditions, there remains an undertone of extreme HOLDing and accumulation behaviour. This is somewhat unique to this market cycle and is a dynamic worth keeping an eye on.\n\nRelative STH-LTH Supply PNL Live Chart\nLightning Network Adoption\n\nIn the headlines this week is the adoption of Bitcoins Lightning Network (LN), primarily by El Salvador, and by Twitter as an integrated payment feature. We have also released a suite of Lightning Network metrics to Glassnode Studio that helps describe thew extraordinary growth of the protocol over recent months.\n\nThe number of LN nodes is one of many metrics at an all-time-high, reaching 15.6k nodes this week.\n\nLightning Node Count Live Chart\n\nThe number of LN channels have reached highs of 73k, representing an average of 4.6 channels per node. This is around double the number of channels that were live through the period from 2019-20, with most of this growth occurring since May 2021.\n\nLightning Channel Count Live Chart\n\nTotal BTC capacity in LN channels has seen explosive growth over the last nine months, rising 170% in 2021 to reach 2,904 BTC (~$127M). 514 of these coins were added to LN channels in September alone.\n\nLightning Capacity Live Chart\n\nFinally, the mean and median channel size has been climbing steadily as adoption and confidence in the protocol grows. The average channel capacity is accelerating higher from the stable baseline of ~0.028 BTC in 2019-20 to 0.040 BTC today. Median channel size has also lifted to 0.01 BTC, having risen notably through July and August.\n\nThe adoption and growth of the Lightning Network, both via scaling out in El Salvador, and in Twitter implementations, is an exciting challenge for the industry.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 38, 2021)\n\nBull market Bitcoin buyers take modest profits this week, whilst exchange balances continue to decline, and miner hash-rate recovery continues.\n\nCheckmate\nSep 20, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market traded slightly higher this week, opening at a low of $43,789, and trading up to an intra-day high of $48,730. Prices are forming a consolidation trading range after the volatile sell-off that started off the previous week, clearing $4B in excess leverage in one hour.\n\nThe Bitcoin market finds itself amidst a macroeconomic landscape punctuated by growing uncertainties in Chinese credit markets, and downside price action for traditional equities over the week. Despite this backdrop, Bitcoin price action, and on-chain investor responses appear relatively robust. This week, we will assess the continued dominance of coin outflows from exchanges, recovering miner hash-rate, and the realisation of modest profits with the market absorbing the sell-side pressure.\n\nModest Realisation of Profits\n\nIn on-chain analysis, we often build models upon the concept of 'realised value' for a coin, that is the price at which a UTXO, containing some volume of BTC, was created. Another way to consider this is the price at which a coin last moved, thus reflecting the on-chain 'cost basis' for that coin.\n\nWhen a coin is spent at a later time, we can assess the difference between the original realised price, and the current spent price to assess if the owner is realising a profit, or a loss. The aggregate value of all coins spent that day the provides an estimate on the volume of capital flowing into the market, as every seller is by definition matched with a buyer.\n\nSince late July, the market has consistently realised net profits on the order of around $1B per day as prices rallied from $31k to over $52k. This suggests a relatively meaningful bid has supported the market on the way up.\n\nNet Realised PnL Live Chart\n\nWe can assess the Spent Output Age Bands to get a gauge on the cohorts of investors who are spending coins in the current market. For coins older than 6-months, there has been a reasonable uptick in spending behaviour throughout the August rally, however that spending has cooled off through September. The proportion of spent outputs older than 6m+ currently sits at around 4% dominance of all spent coins.\n\nSpent Output Age Bands Live Chart\n\nThe Long-term Holder SOPR provides another view on this spending behaviour, and it has become increasingly volatile since early July. This indicator tracks the aggregate profit multiple realised by spent coins that were older than around 155-days (~5-months).\n\nA LTH-SOPR value of 2.0 means that on aggregate, LTHs realised a 200% gain on their spent coins that day.\n\nWe can also flip this observation around to estimate the aggregate cost basis for LTHs who are spending coins by dividing the BTC price by the LTH-SOPR value.\n\nA LTH-SOPR value of 2.0 at a BTC price of $36k gives an aggregate LTH cost basis of $36k/2.0 = $18k cost basis.\n\nThe increased volatility in the LTH-SOPR indicator therefore demonstrates that LTHs are spending coins which were accumulated across an increasingly large range of cost bases:\n\nLower Bound LTH-SOPR = 1.5 suggests coins spent have a cost basis between $24k to $31k\nUpper Bound LTH-SOPR = 2.0 suggests coins spent have a cost basis between $18k to $23k\n\nOverall, the range of aggregate cost basis for LTH spent coins since May is therefore between $18k and $31k. Note these are all prices from within the 2020-21 bull market and suggests that perhaps Bitcoin long-term investors are becoming more active traders, taking profits off the table, or perhaps using coin margined derivatives to hedge risk, or speculate to a greater extent than was seen in Q1 and Q2. It may also reflect some uncertainty regarding current market structure as coins with higher cost basis, closer to the current price, are preferentially spent.\n\nLTH-SOPR Live Chart\n\nTo demonstrate this, the chart below shows the estimated LTH spent cost basis (blue, 7-day Median) calculated as Price / LTH-SOPR. We can see that following the sell-off in May, the aggregate cost basis for LTH spent coins rose from the stable baseline of $8k, up to the new range between the $18k and $31k bounds calculated above. This reflects the LTH threshold (155-days) encompassing coins above last cycles $20k ATH, as well as more LTH spending during the volatility since mid-May.\n\nLTH Cost Basis Workbench Chart\nExchange Balances Continue Outflows\n\nWhilst there is spending behaviour observable amongst the existing cohort of Bitcoin holders, it appears there is even more demand for coins accumulated from exchange balances.\n\nOverall exchange balances have continued to decline this week, reaching a new multi-year low of 13.0% of circulating supply this week. This returns exchange balances to levels last seen in Feb 2018. Keep in mind that prices were trading between $6k and $10k at that time. The accumulation of coins after March 2020, with prices trading up from $3.8k to over $64k in April, reflects the significant growth of capital inflows necessary to withdraw this relative coin volume.\n\nExchange Balance Live Chart\n\nSupporting this observation, is a deeply negative (outflows) exchange net-flow reading this week, with current BTC outflows occurring at a rate of -92k BTC/month. Similar to the exchange balance chart above, the market clearly shifted paradigm after March 2020, from a regime of net exchange inflow dominance, to outflow dominance.\n\nExchange Net Position Change Live Chart\n\nWe can also investigate the comparative performance of various groups of exchanges with similar balance flow characteristics. The first cohort of exchanges includes Bittrex, Bitfinex, Kraken, Gemini and Binance.\n\nThese exchanges demonstrate a characteristic inflow and balance growth throughout most of 2020 and 2021, reflecting a rising dominance in coin holdings. Binance and Gemini are the primary recipients of this cohort. Since the sell-off in May, balances across this exchange group have plateaued and seen modest coin outflows.\n\nExchange Balance Live Chart\n\nThe second cohort of exchange balance characteristics are seen across Bitstamp, OKEx, Huobi and Coinbase. For this cohort, outflows have persisted since March 2020 and have actually accelerated in recent weeks.\n\nOverall, the net balance across exchanges has continued to decline as the inflows observed in May are absorbed by the market and moved to investor wallets.\n\nExchange Balance Live Chart\nBitcoin Miner Recovery and ThermoCap Model\n\nIn a continued display of network resilience, Bitcoin hash-rate has climbed again this week, reaching approximately 137 Exahash on a 7-day MA basis. Given the total decline from the all-time-high represented around half the hash-power network, this ~52% recovery means that less than a quarter of the peak network hash remains offline.\n\nHashrate Live Chart\n\nThroughout 2020 and 2021, miners have demonstrated an increased trend of HODLing a larger proportion of mined coins than in previous market cycles.\n\nAfter a significant miner distribution that occurred  in Jan-Feb 2021, miners have accumulated 14,000 BTC in unspent coinbase rewards over a 6.5 month period. A moderate spend of around 1,360 BTC occurred in late August, however the uptrend in miner unspent supply appears to be back in play.\n\nMiner Unspent Supply\n\nLastly we will look at the Thermocap, which is a fundamental valuation model for Bitcoin representing the aggregate security spend to date. It is calculated as the cumulative sum of all block rewards paid to miners, as valued in USD, at the time of block production.\n\nAnother way to think about this metric, is that it reflects the cumulative value offered by the Bitcoin protocol as a reward for miners. As such, it can also be considered an upper bound on the cost of production for all circulating BTC, assuming miners are rational profit motivated actors. If $1B in total block reward is offered, we can expect miners to spend and compete with up to $1B worth of investment to earn that reward.\n\nThe Thermocap is currently sitting at $30.3B whilst the Bitcoin market cap is at $900B. If we consider the thermocap as the 'maximum aggregate cost of BTC production', Bitcoin is currently trading at a multiple of 29.7x above production cost. This is a 2,870% premium to lifetime aggregate miner input costs!\n\nThermocap Live Chart\n\nWe can take this concept one step further using the Workbench tool, to construct Bitcoin's block subsidy model (originally developed by the newest addition to the Glassnode analyst team, @permabullnino).\n\nHere we calculate multiples on the Thermocap (2x, 6x, 32x and 64x) to reflect a growing monetary premium of the Bitcoin network above its aggregate cost of production. We can spot some interesting behaviours:\n\nEach cycle adds to the minimum monetary premium at the end of bear markets. The raw Thermocap (1x) caught the 2011 bear bottom, 2x Thermocap caught the 2015 market, and 6x Thermocap provided support for 2018-19 and March 2020.\nBull cycle tops have generally peaked between 32x and 64x as the market gets overextended and exceeds the cost of production by large multiples.\n\nAt the current prices, the topping model of 64x Thermocap reflects a Bitcoin market cap of $1.94 Trillion ($103k BTC price). Bitcoin is currently trading just slightly under the 32x Thermocap model, which is located at $969B.\n\nBitcoin Block Subsidy Model Live Chart\n\nFinally, we can observe this phenomena by taking the ratio between the market cap and the Thermocap. This oscillator reflects the changing magnitude of Bitcoins monetary premium relative to its aggregate cost of production.\n\nWe can see the aforementioned steadily rising floor value, or 'minimum monetary premium' reached at the lows of each market cycle. The peak of bullish market cycles can also be seen to top out at relatively consistent levels exceeding 32x the Thermocap model.\n\nBitcoin Block Subsidy Model Live Chart\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nReleased tutorial video for Workbench.\nReleased Futures Annualized Rolling Basis (3M)\nAdditional Workbench functions added cumsum(m1, since)\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 37, 2021)\n\nWe assess the market response of Bitcoin traders and investors following a week of volatility lead by derivatives markets.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nSep 13, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market experienced a high volatility sell-off early in the week, with prices initially breaking up to a new local high of $52,849, before selling down to a low of $44,196. What appeared to be the main driver on the sell-side, was a flushing out of excessive leverage in futures markets.\n\nMeanwhile, in spot and on-chain markets, the historically significant trend of investor accumulation and long term holding remains well and truly intact. Despite a 50%+ sell-off experienced in May, a strong rally from the $29k lows, and now another sharp sell-off this week, HODLers appear unphased.\n\nThis week, we will explore both the leverage flush that initiated the price mark down, and deep dive into the observable dynamics in the on-chain Bitcoin supply.\n\nDerivatives Lead Downside Volatility\n\nIn last weeks newsletter and video report, we covered how the growth in futures contracts open interest, and increasingly positive perpetual swap funding rates in Bitcoin and Ethereum markets.\n\nThis highlighted a growing risk that excess leverage, with a long directional bias, could create a downside price squeeze. On Tuesday, both markets indeed saw a significant sell-off, with Bitcoin trading down more than $10k in one hour. This event acted to clear out much of the accumulated leverage, with the market consolidating for the rest of the week.\n\nFrom the local high of $13.4B in open perpetual futures interest, a total of $4B worth of contracts (30%) were closed out and cleared within the hour. Leverage has remained fairly steady at around $9.4B for the remainder of the week.\n\nPerpetual Open Interest Live Chart\n\nUsing the Long Liquidation Dominance metric, we can see that just prior to this sell-off, futures markets actually experienced a brief short liquidation squeeze, that aided in pushing prices up to the local high of $52.8k. Short liquidations represented 80% of all liquidations during this time.\n\nImmediately following this peak, the opposite occurred, with the proportion of long contract liquidations spiking to 68%, as BTC prices fell over $10k from the highs.\n\nFutures Long Dominance Live Chart\n\nOptions markets also saw a spike in volume, as traders rushed to hedge their positions, and capture volatility premium. This has become fairly typical behaviour this year where options markets consistently see elevated activity during market sell-offs.\n\nThe total volume traded in options markets has been in recovery mode since a relative lull in activity through May to July. During the hours around Tuesday's sell-off, traded option volumes reached a multi-month high of $1.3B.\n\nOptions Volume Live Chart\n\nAfter a very brief period of negative funding rates during the sell-off, perpetual markets have returned to slightly positive funding rate suggesting that traders are still expecting upside price momentum. Note however that the magnitude of funding is much lower than it was prior to the crash, suggesting that at least a partial deleveraging has occurred.\n\nFutures Funding Rates Live Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nCoin Dormancy Dominates\n\nNext we will review how spot and on-chain markets reacted to this sell-off. We start by looking at Average Coin Dormancy which presents the average age of the coins spent that day, adjusted per unit of BTC spent with two key takeaway observations:\n\nDormancy did not spike during the sell-off which indicates the average age of coins spent at that time were relatively young, and older hands were not shaken out.\nDormancy has continued to fall this week returning to the lower bound of the 2020 pre-bull period, suggesting the market has a strong preference for longer term holding.\nEntity Adjusted Dormancy Live Chart\n\nRevived supply is a metric that presents how much BTC volume was spent that was older than a particular age. We can use this tool to assess whether there is an influx of previously illiquid and HODLed coins coming back into liquid circulation, or if old coins remain dormant. High levels of revived supply could suggesting a negative shift in investor confidence, whereas low values suggest HODLer conviction remains intact.\n\nDuring this week, 1yr+ revived supply has fallen to remarkably low levels, coincident with that seen in the 2020 pre-bull period. On a 7-day moving median basis, less than 2.5k BTC aged 1yr+ are being spent per day. This is 9x fewer old coins being spent when compared to the 2021 bull market peak in Jan 2021, where over 22.5k BTC were spent as prices reached $42k for the first time.\n\n1yr+ Revived Supply Live Chart\n\nThis observation is confirmed by assessing the proportion of supply in the Young HODL waves, those less than 3 months old. Here we can see that coins younger than 3 months have reached an all time low of 15.9% of the circulating supply. The converse of this is that coins older than 3 months now represent an all time high of 84.1% of supply.\n\nHistorically, periods where young coins reach a minima tend to correlate with late stage bear markets (blue) after significant smart money accumulation has taken place. This is where hype and interest in the asset is at its lowest, whilst accumulation demand by smart money investors is at a relative high. It describes young coins being taken out of liquid circulation and begin to mature in investor wallets.\n\nThe opposite is typically true in late stage bull markets (red) and cycle tops, where the maximum number of old coins are spent and transferred to new investors, attracted by hype, media coverage and price appreciation.\n\nHODL Waves Live Chart\nMacro Accumulation Continues\n\nHODLers are often described as Bitcoins buyers of last resort, who step in during volatile downswings in price, and place their bids when the markets look the worst. These high conviction buyers are best appreciated on-chain using coin ages, with our research suggesting that lifespans of around 155-days is a suitable threshold between Long- and Short-term holders.\n\n155-days ago, in mid-April, the Bitcoin market was trading at $60k, trading up to towards the current all time high. Thus, any coins purchased after the ATH are generally going to be classified as Short-Term Holder coins (STH).\n\nThe chart below shows that at this weeks high of $52.8k, over 16.8% of the coin supply was owned by STHs and in profit. What this reflects is the very large accumulation that occurred between the recent low of $29k, and up to the lower bound of the Q2 topping range.\n\nRelative LTH-STH Profit and Loss Live Chart\n\nWe can also see that LTH owned supply has reached 79.5% of all BTC coins this week, which is equivalent to the level reached in October, prior to the bull market kicking off. In fact, on an absolute coin volume basis, LTHs currently own the most coins in history, hitting 12.97M BTC this week. Peaks in LTH owned supply typically correlate with late stage bear markets which are historically followed by a supply squeeze and initiation of cyclical bull runs.\n\nLTH Supply Live Chart\n\nIt is quite impressive to see the volume of BTC crossing the 155-day STH-to-LTH threshold has maintained a very positive rate since May. One could have reasonably expected it to slow dramatically as many coins that were initially purchased in Q2 2021, in the $50k to $64k range, were sold at a loss in May and June.\n\nHowever, the charts above, and the Long-Term Holder Net Position change actually demonstrates that a very large portion of the supply accumulated in that topping range, remain unspent, and tightly held to this day.\n\nAt the moment, coins are crossing the LTH age threshold at a strong rate of 421k BTC per month. Given we have already established that more than 16.8% of the supply was accumulated in the recent $29k to $40k range, there is a good case to be made this trend will continue into October-December (155-days after the May-July consolidation).\n\nLTH Net Position Change Live Chart\n\nFinally, we review the Liquid and Highly Liquid coin supply (see our methodology) on a macro scale which highlights just how unique position the current market cycle is. For the vast majority of bitcoins life, there has been an expansion in the volume of coins that freely circulated and were spent frequently on-chain. After the final capitulation sell-off for the 2018 bear market, liquid supply started to plateau, a trend that persisted until March 2020.\n\nFollowing the sell-off in March, a structural trend of increasing coin illiquidity has dominated the on-chain supply dynamics, as more coins transitioned out of exchange balances, and into long term investor wallets.\n\nAfter the moderate exchange inflows in May 2021, this downtrend in liquid coin supply (increasing HODLing behaviour) has resumed, suggesting macro conviction to hold BTC remains a dominant force in the market. It appears that despite significant volatility through 2021, long term Bitcoin investors continue to accumulate and keep coins in cold storage.\n\nLiquid and Illiquid Supply Live Chart\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nReleased tutorial video for Workbench.\nReleased Options ATM Implied Volatility metrics for All, 1w, 1m, 3m, 6m,\nRelease Spent Output Volume Bands SVAB and individual component metrics\nRelease Inter-Exchange metrics: Inter-Exchange Transfers and Inter-Exchange Volume\nReleased In-House Exchange Metric, Futures Term Structure and Futures Term Structure by Exchange\nReleased Revived Supply Metrics for 1y+, 2y+, 3y+ and 5y+\nAdditional Workbench functions added sum(m1, period), log(m1), pow(m1, n),abs(m1), range(m1, start, end) ,  std(m1, period), and diff(m1, period),\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 36, 2021)\n\nThe Bitcoin market shows continued strength, as on-chain volumes indicate a growing dominance, and stickiness of institutional transaction sizes and capital inflows.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nSep 6, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has continued to power higher, breaking out of last weeks consolidation to new multi-month highs. Prices traded up from the weekly low of $46,562 to reach a high of $51,838.\n\nAs renewed optimism follows positive price action, on-chain transaction volumes are showing continued growth in dominance by large, institutional sized capital. We are also seeing declines in volume spent by long-term investors, A preference to HODL, and the accumulation of young coins. Miners have also started spending coins this week as hash-rate recovers over 42% since the July lows.\n\nMiners Take Profits Off the Table\n\nThe Bitcoin mining market continues to recover after half of the hash-power came offline during the Great Migration out of China. The 14-day median hash-rate has recovered to 128 EH/s, which is approximately 29% below the all-time-high, and reflects a 42% recovery from the July lows.\n\nThe increase in hash-rate is likely a combination of previously obsolete hardware finding a second lease on life, and miners in China successfully relocating, re-establishing or re-homing their hardware and operations.\n\nCompetition in the mining market has continuously increased over time, leading the protocol difficulty to consistently rise. This growth has occurred despite the programmatic decline in new BTC issuance with each halving event. As a result, macro BTC rewards per hash have been in a long-term decline.\n\nWhilst miner incomes are denominated in BTC, their  CAPEX and OPEX costs are largely denominated in fiat currencies. This makes miner effective revenue subject to price volatility.\n\nWith such a large portion of the mining hardware offline, and a global production constraints on ASIC chip manufacture, the current mining market is finding itself slow to respond to elevated coin prices since 2020. There are simply fewer machines fighting over the same number of coins, trading at higher coin prices.\n\nAs a result, miner USD revenue per hash has now risen back to July 2019 levels of $380k per Exahash, making operational miners exceptionally profitable on a historical basis.\n\nAs BTC prices hover around the $50k range over the last few weeks, some of these miners have started spending a portion of their coin balances to lock in profits. This week, around 2,900 BTC have been spent from miner balances, equal to around $145M at a $50k BTC price.\n\nThis may be a combination of affected miners in China obtaining fiat liquidity to cover costs, or operational miners taking profits and de-risking after the May sell-off. It is also likely that some of this revenue is earmarked for redeployment into facility expansion, and acquiring hardware from second-hand or new ASIC markets.\n\nNote: the chart below uses our Workbench tool to subtract out the Patoshi coins to reflect the coin balance held by the remainder of the mining market.\n\nMiner Balance (excl. Patoshi Coins) Live Chart\n\nIn response, the miner net position change has returned to a neutral level, indicating an on-net equilibrium between miner accumulation, and miner spending over the last 30-days. It is typical for the miner net position change metric to oscillate between around +5k and -5k BTC per month, making the current dynamics reasonably expected behaviour, and the market has clearly absorbed the additional sell-side pressure.\n\nMiner Net Position Change Live Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nTransaction Size, On The Rise\n\nA key theme and characteristic of the 2020 to 2021 market cycle has been the increase in institutional sized capital. This trend is increasingly visible on-chain, and even after the 50% correction in May, appears to be a relatively sticky.\n\nThe average USD transaction size in the 2019-20 bear market was typically between $6k to $8k. This period was largely dominated by retail and early investment fund participants.\n\nThe 2020-21 bull market saw average transaction sizes increase significantly into a peak of $58.6k during the May sell-off. This has largely cooled off from July onwards, with the current average transaction size between $30k and $36k.\n\nRelative to the 2019-20 period, this represents a significant 370% increase, despite the recent correction, reflecting continued and sticky institutional sized interest.\n\nEA-Mean Transaction Size Live Chart\n\nFurther support for this observation is found the rising proportion of transaction volume dominance by $100k+ sizes. In the chart below, we can see the gradual squeezing of smaller size capital (<$100k) in yellow-red from 40% dominance in 2017, to represent only 10% to 20% of on-chain volumes today.\n\nConversely, institutional and high-net-worth size capital of $100k+ in green has expanded significantly over the last 12 months. The cohort moving between $1M and $10M (light green) has consistently represented between 20% to 30% of transaction volume since 2017.\n\nThe $10M+ cohort (dark green) however have grown considerably, from only 10% in October 2020, to over 30% dominance today. This reflects a notable growth in large size capital allocation and trading activity. Note that this data is entity adjusted, and thus filters for only economically meaningful activity (excludes self-spends and exchange wallet management for example).\n\nRelative Volume By Size Live Chart\nYoung Coin Volume Dominates\n\nAnother observation regarding transaction volumes relates to classification based on coin ages. We have recently released a new metric called the Spent Volume Age Bands (SVAB), which classifies the proportion of daily coin volume by coin age. It is a counterpart to the Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB) metric, which ignores coin volume, and only looks at age brackets in proportion to the daily transaction count.\n\nSome general principles for interpretation of these metrics are:\n\nWhen more old coins (> 6m) are spent, there is a higher probability that previously illiquid coins are coming back into liquid circulation. This is most common during capitulation events, and in bull markets as coins are sold into strength.\nWhen more young coins (1d to 6m) are spent, there is a higher probability that smart money investors and long-term holders are holding, and accumulation is taking place, as 'hot coins' are taken off the market.\nHot coins are those with lifespans less than 1-week. These dominate day-to-day network traffic and are more likely to be re-spent in response to volatility.\n\nFrom a macro view we can see that hot/young coin volumes spike and dominate on-chain volumes in three typical occasions:\n\nBlow off tops where trading, speculation and 'hot money' movements reach a maximum.\nCapitulation events where new buyers are shaken out en mass and coins change hands many times during high volatility. Smart money also tend to step in and accumulate.\nDisbelief rallies at the start of bullish trends as traders sell into the first market strength seen in a long time.\nSVAB Live Chart\n\nThe dominance of hot coin (< 1wk) volume is currently at a relative high of 94% of spent coin volume. Simultaneously, middle and old coin (> 1mth) volume is at an extreme low of less than 2% dominance which is even lower than the bear market base-load seen in 2019-20.\n\nWhat this suggests is that the vast majority of coins spent at the moment, even as prices breach $50k, are highly liquid coins, and old coins are remarkably dormant. This indicates that conviction to HODL is extremely high and a lack of liquid supply could squeeze spot market prices higher.\n\nSVAB Live Chart\n\nTo further confirm this analysis, we can see the volume of revived supply older than 1yr has fallen below 5k BTC per day. This indicates that investors who own coins older than 1yr are spending less, and HODLing more, even as prices rally. Previous events with low revived 1yr+ supply correlate with late stage bear markets and early bull markets.\n\nRevived 1yr+ Supply Live Chart\nLeverage Reaches New Heights\n\nThe final observation this week relates to the derivatives markets. Alongside positive sentiment and conviction to HODL in spot and on-chain markets, we are seeing open interest approach, or reach, new all-time-highs for Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nBitcoin perpetual futures markets currently have over $11.8B in open contracts which is trending strongly towards the April peak of $15B.\n\nBTC Perpetual Futures Open Interest Live Chart\n\nThe market appears to be net long in perpetual futures markets with funding rates for BTC hitting approaching 0.03%. Whilst this level of positive lean is not overly high relative to levels seen in Q1 and Q2, it is similar to the funding rate seen just prior to the May sell-off. This could create a shorter term headwind if longs are squeezed out of their positions.\n\nBTC Funding Rates Live Chart\n\nThis effect is even more pronounced for Ethereum where perpetual futures open interest has surpassed the previous ATH, hitting $7.8B this week.\n\nETH Perpetual Futures Open Interest Live Chart\n\nFunding rates for ETH futures have similarly accelerated higher, reaching 0.02%, a level coincident with that seen prior to the May sell-off.\n\nWhilst the supply dynamics in spot markets continue to show strength, caution and awareness is appropriate when of high degrees of leverage has entered derivatives markets. The combination of positive funding rates and high open interest can be an important indicator set for assessing a shorter term risk of cascading long liquidations.\n\nETH Funding Rates Live Chart\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nRelease Spent Output Volume Bands SVAB and individual component metrics\nRelease Inter-Exchange metrics: Inter-Exchange Transfers and Inter-Exchange Volume\nReleased In-House Exchange Metric, Futures Term Structure and Futures Term Structure by Exchange\nReleased Revived Supply Metrics for 1y+, 2y+, 3y+ and 5y+\nAdditional Workbench functions added sum(m1, period), log(m1), pow(m1, n),abs(m1), and range(m1, start, end)\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 35, 2021)\n\nAn on-chain divergence has developed between price, on-chain activity and supply dynamics, creating a market structure similar to an early bull impulse.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nAug 30, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market entered price consolidation this week, largely hanging onto the impressive gains since the bottom set in late July. Prices traded between a weekly low of $46,465 and a new local high of $50,461.\n\nAs the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market rallies higher, a remarkable on-chain divergence continues to form across both Bitcoin and Ethereum. On-chain activity on both chains has remained quiet relative to bull market highs, even as price momentum continues upwards, and bullish trends in supply dynamics remain in play. This week, we explore and compare a number of on-chain metrics between Bitcoin and Ethereum to characterise this divergence.\n\nSetting the Stage\n\nBefore starting our comparative analysis, we will take a quick look at the big picture position of the Bitcoin market following a very month of strong price performance. With prices pushing above $50k, and some notable profit taking covered last week, the market currently sits at the top end of a very high on-chain volume node.\n\nThe chart below shows the price bands where the current BTC coin supply was last transacted. Since breaching last cycles $20k ATH, three distinct on-chain volume bands have formed:\n\n$31k to $40k (Price Floor) where over 2.98M BTC were accumulated, both in Jan 2021, and in the recent 2.5 month long consolidation. This is likely now a very strong underlying support zone.\n$45k to $50k (Current Range) where 1.65M BTC have a cost basis. With price at the top end of this range, it is likely that this too could act as strong price support.\n$53.7k to $59k (Trillion Dollar Asset) where 1.336M BTC were accumulated between March and May and are still holding unrealised losses. These coins are those that remain unshaken by a 50%+ correction in May, but could also become overhead resistance if investors seek to exit at their cost basis.\n\nOn net, this indicates that a fairly strong set of high conviction investors remain in the market and is a powerful signal for the bulls.\n\nBTC URPD Live Chart\n\nWithin this context, profits have continued to be realised throughout August as prices continued to trade higher. This suggests an underlying market strength, capable of absorbing this spent coin supply. The aSOPR metric shows that similar behaviour was observed after the March 2020 sell-off with the following sequence of events:\n\nCapitulation where losses were realised by panic sellers for an extended period of time.\nProfitability Returns as signalled by aSOPR trading and holding above 1.0. This suggests profits are realised but market strength is sufficient to absorb sell pressure.\nBuyer Conviction Returns as aSOPR resets to 1.0 on a number of occasions, and then bounces higher, suggesting holders of profitable coins prefer to stay dormant, and investors are buying the dip.\naSOPR Live Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nOn-chain Activity Divergence\n\nWhilst prices rally, an impressive divergence has been maintained in on-chain activity. Demand for blockspace on both Bitcoin and Ethereum remains well below recent peaks despite prices returning to elevated trading ranges.\n\nActive entities on the Bitcoin network is currently around 275k per day, around 35% below the January peak.\n\nBitcoin Active Entities Live Chart\n\nActive addresses on Ethereum are similarly down 33% from the May peak, currently sitting at around 450k addresses per day. It is notable that current activity on both chains is similar to the stable pre-bull accumulation range established in mid to late 2020.\n\nEthereum Active Addresses Live Chart\n\nSimilar observations can be made regarding transaction counts which provide a proxy for block-space demand. Bitcoin transaction counts are down to around 200k per day, a significant drop of 37.5% below the peak.\n\nBitcoin Transaction Count Live Chart\n\nEven more dramatic is the USD denominated on-chain transaction volume which is currently down 62.5% to $6B per day relative to the April ATH. Note that the transaction counts above, and volume below, uses our Entity-Adjusted data, which filters out internal transfers and self-spends and thus reflects the magnitude of economically meaningful volume.\n\nTotal Transaction Volume by Size Live Chart\n\nAs a result of this slim demand for block-space, Bitcoin network transaction fees have declined considerably, returning to levels that have not been seen in the last year. At present, transaction fees average 21 BTC per day, representing only 1 to 2% of the total block reward.\n\nBitcoin Transaction Fees Live Chart\n\nFor Ethereum, transaction counts are also down 33% from the highs, with counts actually declining over the course of this week to around 1100k per day.\n\nEthereum Transaction Counts Live Chart\n\nInterestingly, within the Ethereum ecosystem, we are seeing a fairly dramatic divergence in on-chain attention. Whilst transaction counts and active addresses are down, the magnitude of fees paid are trading significantly higher. This is most likely attributed, at least in part, to the strong demand for NFT trading and investing.\n\nTotal transaction fees on the Ethereum network currently sit around 10k ETH per day which represents a relatively high level, comparable to 'DeFi summer', and the 2021 Bull.\n\nEthereum Transaction Fees Live Chart\n\nHowever the heightened market attention for NFTs has come at a cost, with DeFi tokens appearing to be the losers in the equation. The chart below presents on-chain transaction data for four blue chip DeFi tokens AAVE, COMP, UNI and YFI. The top row presents active addresses interacting with the tokens, and the bottom row the USD value transferred in the tokens.\n\nAcross the board, it paints a somewhat bleak picture, with all four seeing structural declines in investor attention, most breaking to new lows this week in particular.\n\nDeFi Token Performance Live Dashboard\nBullish Supply Dynamics\n\nThe question of whether a divergence in on-chain activity is bullish or bearish is a complex one, as more trading volume for digital assets shifts to off-chain exchanges and derivative instruments. Furthermore, technological advances such as transaction batching, SegWit adoption, and usage of Lightning Network and other Layer 2s make it a dynamic problem to solve.\n\nOn the other hand, supply dynamics, particularly looking at coin maturity, provides a fairly robust signal in either direction. Whilst observations of accumulation and HODLing is usually a long range indicator (i.e. takes time to play out), the current market trend is historically strong for the bulls.\n\nThe following charts present a series of supply dynamics indicators for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and it will become immediately obvious that similarities exist between both chains, and both look very constructive.\n\nYoung coins are those younger than 3 months. They are the most likely to be spent during volatility. A decline in the young coin HODL waves indicates the market is preferring to HODL and not to spend. Young BTC now represent only 15%% of the coin supply and a very strong downtrend is in play.\n\nBitcoin HODL Waves Live Chart\n\nEthereum HODL waves are almost the same chart, with young coins trending down towards a long term low of 12.5% of the circulating supply.\n\nEthereum HODL Waves Live Chart\n\nAs these young coins mature and age, they transition into Middle Aged (3m to 1y) and old coins (1y+). These mature coins are statistically less likely to be spent, and a climbing proportion of them suggests increasing illiquid supply.\n\nA powerful uptrend in coin maturation is in play for Bitcoin with almost 50% of the coin supply aged between 3m and 3y.\n\nBitcoin HODL Waves Live Chart\n\nAgain, Ethereum supply shows a similar trend with a whopping 70% of the ETH coin supply dormant for at least 3 months. For both assets, these uptrends in older coin supply commenced around March 2021, which therefore reflects a very strong demand to buy and hold throughout this bull market.\n\nEthereum HODL Waves Live Chart\n\nTo highlight this change in market behaviour, and in agreement with a minimal desire for long term investors to spend coins, the Liveliness metric for both chains has entered a very strong downtrend. As a quick refresher on Liveliness:\n\nLiveliness maps out whether more coin days are accumulated (HODLing) or destroyed (spending) by the total coin supply.\nDowntrends suggest accumulation where more dormancy and coin maturity is building up, and less spending is taking place.\nUptrends suggest spending where old coins are moved, lifespan is destroyed and distribution takes place.\nSteeper trends mean stronger fundamental trends of the above are in play.\n\nBitcoin liveliness has reentered a downtrend which has accelerated during this price rally.\n\nBitcoin Liveliness Live Chart\n\nEthereum's liveliness metric paints much the same picture, trending strongly down since the May sell-off. Given a huge volume of ETH is transacting at the moment in the NFT movement, it does indicate that much of this volume are the same ETH tokens changing hands.\n\nEthereum Liveliness Live Chart\n\nFinally, a good signal of adoption, interest, accumulation and HODLing is the growth in non-zero balances. Bitcoin non-zero addresses have continued to grind higher, having returned to over 38M addresses, and about to take out the ATH.\n\nBTC Non-zero Addresses Live Chart\n\nMuch like its elder, Ethereum non-zero address counts are also in strong ascent, reaching a new ATH of 60.7M addresses.\n\nETH Non-zero Addresses Live Chart\n\nWhilst the divergence between price and on-chain activity is historically abnormal for a full scale bull market, it is not an uncommon signature for the pre-bull, and pre-supply-squeeze dynamic. These periods often accompany the end of bear market accumulation where the investors who remain, are the strong hands, those with the highest conviction.\n\nSupply dynamics seem to suggest an extremely robust underlying demand is present, and this should continue to be quite constructive for prices if the trend continues. Aggressive spending of older coins would be a key invalidation signal to watch out for.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nRelease Bitcoin Volatility Index metric\nAdded share function to Workbench charts\nAdded Replace function for Workbench metrics\nImprovements to Workbench 'download chart' function\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 34, 2021)\n\nBitcoin has continued to rally to new multi-month highs despite an uptick in distribution, spending by older coins, and a divergence in on-chain activity.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nAug 23, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has experienced yet another strong week, with prices rallying from the weekly low of $43,998 to a new multi-month high of $49,669. Confidence, conviction and positive sentiment has followed this uplift in prices, as Bitcoin climbs closer to reclaiming its Trillion dollar valuation. The key level to break is $53k for Bitcoin to return to the 12-zero's club.\n\nThis week has seen some minor profit realisation on-chain by long term holders, although so far it does not appear to be of significant coin volume to put the brakes on. In this edition of the newsletter, we will assess both the state of on-chain activity as well as characterise the current spending behaviour of investors.\n\nOpen Interest Escalates\n\nIn derivatives markets, open interest for both Futures and Options has climbed alongside price to reach new local highs. After the precipitous fall from the $27.4B ATH during the May sell-off, open interest in Bitcoin futures markets has risen by $6B (+56%) from the lows of the recent consolidation. This week in particular, saw an increase of $1B in futures contracts opened as traders begin to take on more leverage.\n\nFutures Open Interest Live Chart\n\nIn terms of directional bias for traders, the perpetual futures funding rate has a moderate lean to the long side. Funding rates have traded positive since late July as futures markets trade above spot prices. However, the magnitude of funding is nowhere near the peaks seen in the Q1-Q2 bullish trend. This may indicate that excessive leverage is not in play just yet, and perhaps the uptrend remains reasonably spot driven and healthy.\n\nBitcoin Funding Rate Live Chart\n\nOptions markets have also seen multi-month highs in open interest, rising by over $4.1B (+105%) since the lows set in June. The current level of $8.0B in open contracts is similar to levels seen during the May sell-off, and in Jan-Feb 2021. Note that prices were lower, trading around $30k to $40k, in both of these previous instances.\n\nThis too suggests that relative to the total market size, the degree of open interest in derivatives markets is relatively low compared to the degree of leverage seen in the first half of the year.\n\nOptions Open Interest Live Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here. We have also started production for Week On-chain video analysis to provide a deeper dive into the thesis and logic behind each weeks analysis. Visit and subscribe to our YouTube channel, and visit our Video Portal to see our video content.\n\nWeek 33 Dashboard and Video analysis\nWeek 32 Dashboard and Video analysis.\nVideo Analysis Portal\nExchange Balances Plateau\n\nThis week we have seen signals on-chain that some investors, particularly those with older UTXOs, have been spending coins. This week saw a very slight uptick in BTC held on exchanges which follows a month long plateau in coin balances.\n\nAfter the significant net inflow of around 140k BTC to exchanges in May, July saw around 110k BTC in net outflows, largely reversing that trend. However throughout August, exchange balances have stalled at around 2.5M BTC (~13% of circulating supply).\n\nExchange Balance Live Chart\n\nThe Exchange Net Flow metric shows that this week saw overall net inflows to exchanges as some traders and investors appear to be taking profits, and capitalising on market strength. It is worth noting that the magnitude of inflow is not dissimilar to that seen through the Dec 2020 to April 2021 bull market period and is reasonably expected behaviour.\n\nExchange Net Flow Live Chart\n\nThe chart below combines the Realised Profit and Realised Loss metrics using the Workbench tool. From this we can see that overall, investors holding profitable coins are currently spending more value on-chain than those with coins that are underwater.\n\nThe decline in realised losses of late could indicate that investors have found renewed conviction to hold on, or are potentially taking exits that are closer to their original cost basis, as price recovers towards the $50k range.\n\nRealised Profit and Loss Live Chart\nWho Is Spending On-chain?\n\nIf we investigate the Spent Output Age Bands metric, we can start to dissect which cohorts of the market are spending coins. This week has seen a noticeable uptick in older coin ages, particularly those older than  6-months. In the last year, these older coins have come back to life on a similar scale in two instances:\n\nDistribution in a Bull Market as old coin holders take profits into market strength.\nDistribution in Major Sell-offs as old coin holders de-risk during the recent major correction.\nSpent Output Age Bands Live Chart\n\nWe can see a similar view looking at spent outputs aged between 6m and 5y which largely captures experienced Bitcoin investors and traders who have weathered non-trivial volatility in this cycle already. We can see a sharp uptick in all age bands this week which further suggests that some coins are taking exit liquidity.\n\nSpent Output Components Live Chart\n\nThis perspective has also been highlighted by analyst @TXMCtrades who has utilised the Workbench tool to observe the combined proportion of all spent outputs aged between 6m and 5y. TXMC highlights that the current spending behaviour, where 5% to 7% of spent outputs are in this age range, have historically correlated with high volatility periods.\n\nIt is also suggested that relative to previous cycles, owners of older coins tend to be more active traders in more recent years. In the 2011 and 2013 cycles, older coins typically only came back to life around macro tops and bottoms, where as today it is more common around mid-cycle corrections and rallies. This demonstrates a degree of market maturity and financialisation of Bitcoin over time as more active traders and funds enter the space.\n\n3/8 By applying a bit of color, we can highlight areas on the price chart where older coins made up a higher % of daily volume. This helps bring to life the selling behavior of long-term holders.\n\nA few observations stand out... pic.twitter.com/PYT4unq27y\n\n— TXMC (@TXMCtrades) August 23, 2021\n\nThe spending of older coins has also shown up as a trend in the ASOL metric which measures the average age of all spent outputs that day. This trend of rising average age has been in play since July and throughout this rally which suggests two things:\n\nProfits are being realised by old hands, confirming what has been observed in the charts above.\nThe market is absorbing the sell-side so far as prices have continued to climb. This indicates there is sufficient demand to absorb the coins being distributed.\nEA-ASOL Live Chart\n\nThe Realised Cap HODL waves provide a last piece of evidence surrounding the current on-chain spending behaviour, as the young coin bands (< 1 month old) have swelled throughout August. This indicates that older coins have been spent and revalued into younger coin age brackets.\n\nNote however, that the magnitude of increase for these age bands is very much in line with that seen in the 2020 accumulation phase. What this suggests is that whilst old UTXOs have definitely been spent in August, the actual coin volume they distributed is likely not overly significant. This supports the relatively minor exchange balance increase shown in the chart and section above.\n\nRealised Cap HODL Waves Live Chart\nOn-chain Activity Remains Divergent\n\nIn what continues to be an amazing divergence, on-chain activity has still not responded to positive price action. Entity Adjusted transaction counts remain at historically low levels of between 175k and 200k transactions per day.\n\nThese low levels have been seen in a few instances in the past 5-yrs:\n\nThe 2016-17 Bull Market during the disbelief rally and in deep mid-bull pullbacks.\nThe 2018-19 Bear Market as interest in Bitcoin waned and prices corrected 85% from the high.\nThe current period following the 50% correction in May and 2.5 months of consolidation.\nEA-Transaction Counts Live Chart\n\nTransaction volumes are similarly depressed, with the Bitcoin network setting around $18.8B in daily volume. This is 37% lower than at the 2017 bubble peak, and a whopping 57.6% below the peak set during the May capitulation event. That said, settlement volume remains 276% higher than the $5B that was typical throughout 2020, although we should account for fact that price has traded up from $10k to the current level approaching $50k (+500%).\n\nTransaction Volume Live Chart\n\nHowever, despite this significant divergence between rising prices and low on-chain activity, the overall supply dynamics remain extraordinarily macro bullish. This week, the supply held by Long-term holders has reached an all-time-high or 12.69M BTC, surpassing the previous peak from October 2020.\n\nThrough the Q1-Q2 bull market, LTHs distributed approximately 1.75M BTC which ultimately created oversupply, and put in the current ATH price top. Following that, investors dramatically slowed down their spending, and the coins that were accumulated in late 2020 and early 2021 have consistently matured across the ~155-day threshold for classification as 'Long-Term Holders'.\n\nThe recovery of LTH supply to ATH has taken just 100-days which goes to show just how significant the accumulation was in the early phase of this bull market. The fact this trend has yet to slow down also demonstrates that significantly more coin volume is getting older, than younger. This adds further weight to the argument that the old hand spending observed this week is likely of low coin volume, and strategic de-risking, rather than a loss of conviction and a mass exit.\n\nLTH Supply Live Chart\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nAdded custom functions for sma(), ema() and median() to Workbench\nRelease Futures Long Liquidations Dominance\nReleased Liquid, Highly Liquid and Illiquid Supply metrics\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 33, 2021)\n\nThe Bitcoin market powers higher, supported by a growing body of evidence on-chain that a bullish disbelief rally is in effect.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nAug 16, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe uptrend in Bitcoins price has continued this week, rallying from a low of $42,924 into a daily high of $47,831. The market has shown remarkable strength since the local bottom of $29.7k set in July, suggesting strong fundamental spot demand underlies the rally.\n\nThis week, we analyse the on-chain metrics related to the mining market, capital inflows, coin accumulation, and net unrealised profit and loss. Through a complete assessment of the on-chain market structure, we can establish whether the probabilities favour the current market strength as a prelude to a bear, or whether a bull market disbelief rally is in full swing.\n\nMiner Revenues Increase\n\nAs the Bitcoin mining Great Migration continues, and miners transition out of China, we have started to see a recovery in hash-rate from the lows set in July. Hash-rate peaked out at around 180 EH/s in May before falling by 50%. This provides insight into the magnitude of affected miners as being roughly half the network.\n\nOver the course of the last two months, hash-rate has increased by around 25% from the lows, suggesting hash-rate equivalent to around 12.5% of the affected miners have come back online. The network is currently mining at a rate of 112.5 EH/s.\n\nBitcoin Hashrate Live Chart\n\nIn response, the Hash-Ribbons, which attempt to model where stress enters the mining market, have commenced another positive cross-over. The Hash-Ribbons are formed by taking the 30D and 60D moving average of hash-rate with the following signals:\n\n30D Crossing Below 60D is generally a signal of income stress entering the mining market as hash-rate comes offline rapidly. This can create additional sell pressure as miners are generating less income to cover their CAPEX and OPEX costs.\n30D Crossing Above 60D is generally a sign of hash-rate recovery and miner capitulation. After this, the remaining miners have grown their share of the market and thus earn more BTC per hash.\nHash Ribbons Live Chart\n\nWe can confirm this is the case using the Workbench Tool, and taking the ratio between total miner revenue (in BTC), and the active hash-rate. This presents the average BTC earned per hash of mining power.\n\nSince the halving in May 2020, aggregate miner income has declined from around 9.5 BTC/EH to a low of 5.6 BTC/EH in May. As protocol difficulty adjusted in response to the Great Migration, miners who remained online have now seen their BTC income grow by 57% per hash to around 8.8 BTC/EH.\n\nMiner Revenue per hash Live Chart\n\nAs a result of this, we have seen the net balance position of miners continue to increase over the last two months. The net growth of miner balances has now hit +5k BTC/month which demonstrates a net reduction in compulsory sell-side pressure sourced from miners.\n\nMiner Net position Change Live Chart\nAbsorbing Capital Inflows\n\nOne of the most important on-chain metrics for Bitcoin is the Realised Cap, which is the on-chain equivalent to the market cap. It is calculated by valuing each coin at the price when it was last spent, representing an aggregate cost basis for the market. The Realised cap can be considered as follows:\n\nUptrends indicate that coins accumulated at cheaper prices, are being spent, likely sold, and the market must absorb that sell-side pressure to trend higher.\nDowntrends indicate that coins accumulated at higher prices are being sold for a net realised loss and is typical of bearish markets.\n\nThe Realised Cap started trending higher in late-July and has just reached a new all-time-high of $379B. Given spot prices have continued to rally, this indicates that new capital is flowing into Bitcoin, and the market is capable of absorbing that sell-side pressure.\n\nRealised Cap Live Chart\n\nThe net realised Profit and Loss metric demonstrates that since the recent local low of around $29k, the market has realised profits of between $0.5B and $1.5B per day. This follows and extended period of net realised losses through May to July that represented a likely capitulation event.\n\nMarket demand is currently absorbing coins sold at realised profits of a similar magnitude to the period in Nov-Dec 2020, prior to the main bull run. If the market can continue to sustain capital inflows at this level, it sets up a strong base and justification for continued market strength.  \n\nNet Realised PnL Live Chart\n\nIf we take a look at the average value of transactions flowing in and out of exchanges, we get a gauge of the net buy and sell-side action. Prior to the sell-off in May, both inflows and outflows converged around an average transaction value of ~$35k. This level was largely representative of the average exchange flows in Q1 and Q2 2021.\n\nFollowing the May sell-off, both inflows and outflows dropped to $14k and $20k, respectively. These smaller average transaction sizes generally suggest an influx of smaller traders were both shaken out, and stepping in to buy the dip.\n\nSince the recent $29k low, average outflow value has risen back to $35k which is a substantially higher divergence from than the average inflow value of $24k. Overall, this suggests larger size buyers are accumulating and smaller size traders are on the distribution side.\n\nExchange Average Flows live Chart\n\nThis aligns well with the Exchange net position change metric which demonstrates a net outflow has persisted since the start of July. Net outflows from exchange balances is currently occurring at a rate of between 50k and 100k BTC per month. This compares to the approximately 140k BTC in net exchange inflows through May-June we highlighted in our Week 31 edition of the newsletter.\n\nExchange Net Position Change Live Chart\nHolders Return to Profit\n\nAs prices rally, a larger portion of the coin supply returns to profit. This provides us with an opportunity to assess both how many coins were accumulated in particular price ranges, and also assess the aggregate market incentive to sell and realise gains.\n\nSince the low of $29.7k set in July and the current price of $47.0k, a total of 19.2% of the circulating coin supply has returned to profit. This means that around 3.6M BTC were last spent, and thus have an on-chain cost basis in this price range.\n\nFrom this we can deduce that a very significant volume of BTC has been accumulated in this price range. Note also how much larger this jump in profitable supply change is when compared to January where prices were in the same $30k-$40k range. This indicates that on net, approximately 1.4M additional BTC have been revalued within this price range since then.\n\nPercent Supply in Profit Live Chart\n\nThe Net Unrealised Profit/Loss metric provides a cyclical oscillator mapping the magnitude of unrealised gains/losses as a ratio of total market cap value. The NUPL metric has just broken above 0.5 indicating that the total coin supply is currently holding unrealised profits equivalent to 50% of the market cap.\n\nHistorically, a NUPL value of 0.5 is reached following a deep correction in two instances:\n\nBear Market Relief Rallies as was the case in 2014, 2018 and at the end of the mini-bull in 2019. Coin holders take exit liquidity, their profitable sell coins and prices roll over.\nBull Market Disbelief Rallies at which point a modest correction usually follows a NUPL value of 0.5 before the bull run continues. Similar spending behaviour governs as in bearish relief rallies, with investors taking profits into strength. The difference is that the market carries on upwards afterwards, creating additional FOMO buy pressure.\nNUPL Live Chart\n\nFinally, the STH-NUPL, which filters only for short-term Holders has returned to profitability. This means that coins moved within the last ~5 months are on net, slightly above their aggregate cost basis. Similar to the standard NUPL metric, these events are uncommon, but tend to precede explosive moves into a bear, or a bull market.\n\nWith the body of evidence we have outlined above  across miner recovery, strong exchange ouflows, and relatively large accumulation below, the scales have most likely now tipped in favour of the current market conditions being a bull market disbelief rally.\n\nSTH-NUPL Live Chart\nMajor Feature Release: Workbench\n\nWe are pleased to release Workbench, a new tool available in Glassnode Studio to generate custom, multi-line charts and use our formula editor.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 32, 2021)\n\nThe market rallies higher as indications of a Bitcoin on-chain supply squeeze take shape, and Ethereum successfully rolls out EIP1559.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nAug 9, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has seen another strong week, with prices rallying from lows of $37,524 up to a local high of $45,215. The market briefly traded above the 200-day moving average ($45k) over the weekend, before retracing and commencing consolidation. As a well observed technical indicator for bull/bear bias, the markets response to a rejection or breach of the 200-day MA is likely to be a source of attention over the coming weeks.\n\nAs price action confirms underlying market strength, we assess the on-chain response to the rally, seeking to identify whether Bitcoin holders are taking exit liquidity, accumulating, or HODLing on. We will also assess the early stages of Ethereum supply dynamics following the successful release of the EIP1559 fee burn mechanism.\n\nOn-chain Spending Behaviour\n\nWe start our analysis with the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric, which is a relatively short range indicator, presenting a view over the profit and loss realised by coins spent on-chain. Here we have used the Workbench tool to overlay two versions of SOPR:\n\naSOPR representing the whole market, but excluding coins younger than 1hr (non-economical relay transactions)\nSTH-SOPR representing only the profit/loss of Short-Term Holders.\n\nAfter many months trading below a value of 1.0 (net realised losses), both SOPR metrics have executed what looks like a textbook bullish reversal. This is described as follows:\n\nA: SOPR breaks above 1.0 after a sustained period of losses being realised on-chain. This signals profits are realised, and the market was able to absorb that supply.\nB: SOPR reaches a local high profitable coins take advantage of market strength to spend and realise profits. This creates a local top via over-supply, and price corrects.\nC: SOPR resets back to 1.0 signalling profitable coins have stopped being spent and conviction returns to the market and the dip is bought. SOPR then trades higher repeating the rally higher.\n\nMost important to watch is whether SOPR holds above 1.0. Should SOPR continue to trade higher, this reflects a bullish scenario where the market is adequately absorbing profits realised on spent coins. If on the other hand, SOPR falls and trades back below 1.0 on a sustained basis, it would suggest a general weakness in the market and potentially a fake-out rally.\n\nSOPR analysis Live Workbench Chart\n\nThe Spent Output Age Bands demonstrate that on the whole, middle age (3m-12m) and old coins (> 1y) remain relatively dormant, and are not exiting the market seen in 2018. The majority of spending in this cohort are younger and aged between 3m-6m, representing bull market buyers. These transactors may be exiting or de-risking closer to their cost basis.\n\nOverall, this metric remains fairly bullish in that urgent exit selling by old hands does not seem to be occurring.\n\nSpent Output Age Bands Live Chart\n\nASOL is a lifespan metric that generally confirms this observation. ASOL reflects the average age of spent outputs on a per transaction basis (no influence from coin volume spent).\n\nASOL traded higher throughout Q1 and Q2 as old coins were distributed, eventually putting the top in. The bearish shock in May caused this metric to collapse lower, indicating that owners of older UTXOs were largely unwilling to sell at those prices (and did not panic sell).\n\nASOL hasn't returned to the 2020 lows (~20-days), however appears to be trading sideways again. A strong uptrend in ASOL from here would be bearish as it indicates old coins are spent back into liquid circulation. Conversely, ASOL trading sideways to down (as it currently is) would suggest conviction, accumulation and HODLing prevails.\n\nEA-ASOL Live Chart\n\nOn a 14-day median basis, Average Coin Dormancy has returned to around 10-days, the same level as the period of accumulation throughout 2019 and 2020. This lifespan metric presents the average lifespan of spent coins on a per BTC spent basis. It provides further evidence that old hands are not taking exit liquidity at this stage.\n\nThis is likely constructive for prices ahead.\n\nDormancy Live Chart\nLarge Transactions Dominate\n\nIf we investigate the dominance of transactions by size, we can see a clear trend in play. The chart below shows dominance by on-chain transaction volume for values exceeding $1M+ (~23 BTC+ at $43.5k). Since September 2020, the dominance of these large size transactions has risen from 30%, to 70% of the total value transferred.\n\nAs the market traded down to the lows of $29k in late July, the $1M to $10M transaction group spiked markedly, increasing dominance by 20%. This week, the dominance of $10M+ volume followed through with a spike of 20% dominance supporting the price rally.\n\nGiven the lifespan analysis above suggests older coins have been largely dormant of late, this suggests that these large size transactions are more likely to be accumulators than sellers and is again, fairly constructive for price.\n\nRelative Transfer Volume Dominance Live Chart\n\nThe other side of this equation, the chart below demonstrates a structural decline in small size transaction dominance. Transactions of less than $1M in size have declined from 70% to around 30%-40% dominance. These two charts clearly demonstrate a new era of institutional and high net worth capital is flowing through the Bitcoin network since 2020.\n\nRelative Transfer Volume Dominance Live Chart\nSupply Squeeze Assessment\n\nA popular talking point of late has been the potential for a Bitcoin supply squeeze.\n\nIndeed, we have seen an extraordinary recovery of Long-Term Holder (LTH) owned coins, with total supply held approaching 12.48M BTC. This is extremely similar to the volume of coins held by LTHs in October 2020 before the primary bullish impulse started.\n\nThis on-chain response is largely indicative of the volume of coins that were accumulated in Q1 2021 that remain tightly held. It too paints a quite bullish picture for aggregate market conviction.\n\nAlthough do note, increases in LTH supply is a characteristic of bear market accumulation; and bull markets are the result of a supply squeeze, forged in bear markets.\n\nLTH-STH Supply Dynamics Workbench Live Chart\n\nIn the chart above, we have also shown the circulating and adjusted supply metrics. Adjusted supply accounts for coins that are either likely lost, or ancient and deemed extremely illiquid and unlikely to freely circulate.\n\nWe have used Workbench to take the ratio between LTH, or STH held supply, and the Adjusted Supply to see the proportion of 'freely circulating' coins owned by each cohort. By this metric:\n\nLTH Owned Supply has just reached a new All-Time-High of 82.68%. Note also the persistent uptrend in coins held by these long term investors over time.\nSTH Owned Supply continues to decline suggesting HODLing and coin maturation is in play.\nMajor Supply Squeezes have historically occurred when the STH Supply Ratio hits 20% (often holding that level for some time), representing a significant constraint on freely circulating supply.\n\nThe STH Supply Ratio is currently at 25% suggesting that a further maturation of only 5% of adjusted supply would put the market firmly back into historical supply squeeze conditions.\n\nLTH-STH Supply Dynamics Workbench Live Chart\n\nTo assess how likely the remaining 5% of adjusted supply is to be accumulated and maturing, we can inspect the HODL waves.\n\nRelatively young coins aged between 1w and 3m represent a large portion of the liquid supply. We can see that after the uptrend in Q1 (old coin distribution), these age brackets have fallen back to bear market equilibrium level of around 12.5% to 15% of supply. This downtrend indicates that coin maturation is indeed in play, and that many of the 2021 bull market buyers have stuck around to become strong hand HODLers.\n\nHODL Waves Live Chart\n\nThis is largely confirmed by observing the middle to old coin age bands (3m to 2y) which show a remarkable increase in supply from 35.7% to 47.5% of the circulating supply (not adjusted supply). Coins aged 3m to 12m (Bull market buyers) are leading the charge on HODLing behaviour, displaying an undeniable trend of coin maturation.\n\nHODL Waves Live Chart\n\nOf particular note is the 3m to 6m age band, which currently holds 13.35% of the coin supply, and includes the approximate threshold between STH and LTH (155-days). Approximately 6.5% of the entire coin supply reached 3-month maturity on the 15-April, and it appears that these coins are still held.\n\nWhilst the supply squeeze based on the STH Supply Ratio is not yet at 20%, there are numerous indicators and trends in play that suggest it may hit it in mid September (but that the conditions for a supply squeeze are already in play).\n\nHODL Waves Live Chart\nWeekly Feature: The EIP-1559 Burn\n\nThe Ethereum network has recently rolled out the London upgrade which includes the new fee stability mechanism EIP1559. As part of the implementation details is a burn mechanism for the BASE FEE portion of the transaction fee, denominated in ETH.\n\nSince the launch of the London upgrade (block height 12,965,000) until the time of writing (block height 12,986,848), a total of 43.6k ETH has been issued via PoW mining. In that same time, a total of 15.25k ETH has been burned representing a 35% reduction in total net issuance.\n\nTaking as look at the volume of ETH burned per block, we can see that so far fee pressure has pushed the burning mechanism above the design 2 ETH issuance in a handful of instances creating net deflationary blocks. So far, EIP1559 has a mean burn rate of 0.697 ETH per block.\n\nMajor Feature Release: Workbench\n\nWe are pleased to release Workbench, a new tool available in Glassnode Studio to generate custom, multi-line charts and use our formula editor.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 31, 2021)\n\nAs the Bitcoin market rallies over $42k, we analyse the spending and accumulation behaviour of entities on-chain.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nAug 2, 2021 • 9 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has rallied strongly this week, adding to the gains of the short squeeze started on Monday morning. The market opened at the weekly lows of $35,326 and reached an intra-day high of $42,388. This provided some welcomed positive price action after months of consolidation, and multiple retests of the $29k floor.\n\nIn this edition, we assess how the market has reacted to this first set of strong green candles for some time. We analyse the magnitude of profit taking, and how accumulation and spending behaviour is manifesting on-chain.\n\nDisbelief or Bear Relief Rally?\n\nAfter an extended period of very negative sentiment, and sustained downwards price action, Bitcoin has traded high with gusto this week. A key question is whether this is a Disbelief Rally (where everyone doubts the new bull trend), or simply a Bearish Relief Rally in a larger time-frame downtrend.\n\nTo start our assessment, we look to the realised profit and loss on-chain. We can see that after a long period of elevated losses being realised in May to July (pink), over $2B in profits were realised on-chain this week (7-day median). This suggests there is some portion of the market who spent their profitable coins, potentially taking exit liquidity.\n\nRealised PnL Live Chart\n\nThe aSOPR metric provides a view of realised profit/loss by the aggregate market, ignoring coins younger than 1hr. We can see that on net, the majority of on-chain spending have realised losses since the sell-off in May. Each time price rallied, traders spent their coins, making an aSOPR value of 1.0 act as resistance.\n\nThis week aSOPR has rallied significantly higher as profits were realised on-chain. Key observations to keep an eye on from here are:\n\naSOPR resets to 1 and then bounces higher: This indicates the market has stopped realising profits (holding conviction remains) and absorbed the sell pressure (Disbelief).\naSOPR falls back below 1 and stays there: This indicates the market is again realising losses and was unable to absorb the sell-side pressure (Bearish Relief).\naSOPR Live Chart\n\nWe have established that some volume of profitable coins were spent on-chain. We can look to assess which cohorts of holders these coins may have been sourced from. If we assess old coins (>1y) in the Spent Output Age Bands, we can see that there have been four distinct phases of this market cycle:\n\nBull Market Distribution in late 2020 to Q1 2021 as older coins were spent at an accelerating rate.\nTop Formation with slowing distribution from Feb to May 2021.\nCapitulation and Risk-off in May and June as the market reacted to the unprecedented FUD, and a 50% sell-off to $29k.\nDisbelief or Bearish relief through late-July as the market traded down to $29k and then strongly up to $42k this week.\n\nIn an ideal bullish scenario, older coins will remain fairly dormant, spending will remain low or decline, and conviction to hold stays strong. If older coins do start spending, but prices continue to rally, this would indicate a bullish disbelief rally may be in play, and the market is absorbing the spent supply.\n\nConversely, sharp upticks in older coin spending, especially alongside weakening prices, might start to lean closer to a resumption of the bearish trend. It would suggest the market is struggling to absorb the spent supply.\n\nSpent Output Age Bands Live Chart\n\nThe Realised Cap HODL waves, filtered for young coins (<1 week) provides us with the other side of this equation. Typical behaviour of a bull market is older coins are spent to take profits, new investors buy them, and the 'young coin supply' increases. Eventually, the market cannot absorb more supply and rolls over into a bear market. As speculators leave and smart money accumulate, the population of young coins decline as more move into cold storage.\n\nEventually, young coin supply collapses after a capitulation event, and massive accumulation takes hold. Very often, as the market rallies out of this capitulation bottom, or starts a bull market, with a series of Disbelief/Relief rallies (purple). Older coins are spent into the rally to take exit liquidity, increasing the young coin supply again.\n\nThis week, we have seen a notable spike in these younger coins out of what resembles a capitulation bottom. In a bullish scenario, this would subside (HODLing dominates) and/or price continues higher in spite of it (disbelief, absorbing the sell-side). In a more bearish scenario, this starts an uptrend of 'new young coin supply' suggesting weakened conviction to hold the asset by old hands, and increasing liquid supply.\n\nRealised Cap HODL waves Live Chart\n\nLastly on the spending front, we revisit miners who fall into two groups:\n\nOffline Miners impacted by the migration out of China and incurring large costs.\nOnline Miners who are operating at high profitability due to around half the competition being offline.\n\nThe net transfer volume from miners to exchanges bottomed out at less than 100 BTC/day in mid to late July. This week however, we have seen an increase to around 300 BTC/day, which is a 3x increase from the July lows. Keep in mind that this is still in line with typical behaviour throughout 2020 and 2021. It does reflect the resilience of the Bitcoin mining market whereby half of the miners may add to sell-pressure out of necessity, whilst the other half can accumulate at twice the rate.\n\nMiner to exchanges Live Chart\nExchange Supply Falls\n\nSo far we have looked at spending behaviour in response to positive price action. Now we will build up a thesis around the flow of supply out of exchanges, and into on-chain wallets.\n\nThe exchange net position change metric maps out the monthly rate of coins flowing in (green) or out (red) of all exchanges. This week we have seen an extremely large volume of coins flow out of exchanges, comparable to the peak outflows seen in November 2020. The rate hit over 100k BTC per month in outflows this week.\n\nExchange Net Position Change Live Chart\n\nIn terms of the aggregate balance still held on exchanges, holdings have now returned to the 2021 lows of 13.2% of circulating supply. This represents a near full retracement of the significant inflow volume observed during the May sell-off.\n\nExchange Balance Live Chart\n\nAnother interesting dynamic this week is the interplay between coins held on Coinbase and Binance, the two largest exchanges by balance. Coinbase saw significant outflows throughout most of 2021, whilst Binance was the largest recipient.\n\nThe trend for Binance appears to have stalled and started to reverse, with a total outflow of approximately 37.5k BTC this week. Coinbase balances plateaued in June, saw a large deposit of around 30k BTC in mid-July, and this week an outflow of 31k BTC. This has largely unwound all inflows since mid-May. Overall, this may well be the start of another era of net exchange outflows and is a trend to watch.\n\nExchange Balances Live Chart\nMacro Sentiment\n\nTo provide a macro overview of supply dynamics on-chain, we can consult the Liveliness metric in both standard and entity-adjusted forms. Liveliness has the following properties:\n\nUptrends when more coin-days are destroyed than created (old coin spending)\nDowntrends when accumulation and dormancy dominate (HODLing)\nEntity Adjustment corrects for internal, self spends or non-economic transactions\n\nWe can see in the chart below that the market has returned to macro accumulation almost immediately after the May sell-off. Recently the standard liveliness metric jumped significantly higher, suggesting that a potentially large volume of old coins were spent. However, the entity adjusted version does not see the same event, which indicates these coins are classified as 'internal' and likely to be reshuffling of an exchange cold wallet.\n\nAs such, it seems that HODLing and accumulation is the most likely dominant trend in the on-chain market.\n\nLiveliness Live Chart\n\nThe Realised Cap HODL waves tell a similar story with a distinctive uptrend in coin maturation for coins older than 3-months. This has similar hallmarks to accumulation after a blow-off top, although 2021 is coming from a higher HODLed base (~25%) than 2018 (~15%). Progressive peaks of these bands would provide an indication of the volume of coins that are maturing (higher peaks are more bullish, and vice-versa).\n\nKeep in mind that whilst accumulation and coin maturation is bullish, as was seen in the 2018-20 market, a full scale bullish impulse can take some time to develop.\n\nRealised Cap HODL waves\n\nWe can also look to the holdings of on-chain entities, defined as clusters of addresses with the same owner. One of the most aggressive accumulators since May are the Shrimp to Crab cohorts holding < 10 BTC. These small holders now own an all time high of 13.8% of the total coin supply with the trend of accumulation clearly accelerating from May onwards. Of particular note are the 1 to 10 BTC cohort (bottom light green) which distributed since Jan and have returned to accumulation.\n\nEntity Supply Distribution\n\nAs a final closing note, there continues to be historically low activity on-chain. The current entity adjusted transaction count remains down 38% from the peak set in February, currently clocking 200k transactions daily. Whilst on-chain activity can often follow positive price action, current levels are equivalent to the 2018-19 capitulation bottom.\n\nEA Transaction Count Live Chart\n\nThat said, transaction volumes are spiking higher, up 94% from the lows of $4.7B/day, to around $9.1B/day this week. This suggests a that demand for on-chain block-space is likely dominated by fewer, but larger size transactions at present and is an interesting combination of indicators worth keeping an eye on.\n\nEA Transaction Volume Live Chart\nMajor Feature Release: Workbench\n\nWe are pleased to release Workbench, a new tool available in Glassnode Studio to generate custom, multi-line charts and use our formula editor.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 30, 2021)\n\nThe Bitcoin market has experienced a strong rally off the back of a short squeeze returning many coin holders to profitability.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJul 26, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has experienced a strong break-out out this week, trading from the consolidation lows of $29,479, to a high of $35,423 on Sunday. Whilst technically an event for next weeks newsletter, at the time of writing, Bitcoin's price was ralling off the back of what appears to be a short squeeze, reaching a high of $38,677 early Monday morning.\n\nThis week we will review both the derivatives and on-chain market data to assess the lead into this short squeeze, and establish a basis for the profitability of the market. As investors return to profitability, it asks the question as to whether or not they will begin spending those coins into market strength if conviction to hold remains, or has it waned.\n\nShorts Squeezed Higher\n\nWith the growth and maturing of derivative markets, the interplay between spot and leveraged markets creates new dynamics in this market cycle that were not present in the past.\n\nAs we opened the week, open interest in the options markets suggested that volatility was expected. Open interest by strike price one month out (27-August contracts) shows a notable preference for strikes well outside the current consolidation range. The strike prices with the most open interest for 27-Aug on Deribit are:\n\n$25k for Puts with 1,388 BTC in open interest.\n$80k for Calls with 1,513 BTC in open interest.\nOptions OI August Live Chart\n\nOpen interest in perpetual futures markets has remained largely flat over the past two months, ranging between around $10B and $12B since May. Over the last week however, perpetual futures open interest climbed by a notable $1.4B alongside the rally in price. Often-times, elevated open interest starts to increase probabilities of a volatile leverage squeeze occurring.\n\nOpen Interest Live Chart\n\nIf we assess the volume derived from cash-margined collateral, we can see a structural uptrend has been in play since early May. Cash-margined collateral are those futures positions that leverage cash, or cash equivalent (stablecoin) based collateral. In general, cash-margined positions are preferable for market stability as they remove a layer of risk that is present when volatile crypto-margined futures dominate.\n\nCash-Margined Futures Live Chart\n\nConfirming this trend, we can see the relative dominance of crypto-margined futures positions has been in structural decline over the same period, falling from 70% down to 52.5%. Whilst leverage in all forms is known to exacerbate market volatility, these two charts show a clear decline in traders taking on risk-on crypto-margined positions which is a net positive trend for the market. It also adds weight to the risk-off nature of the current market structure.\n\nPercent Crypto-Margined Futures Live Chart\n\nTo assess the directional bias of futures markets, we can see that perpetual funding rates have continued to trade negative. This indicates the net bias remains short Bitcoin. This metric in particular helps us identify that Monday's price rally is likely associated with an overall short squeeze, with funding rates continuing to trade at even more negative levels despite price rallying +30%.\n\nFutures Funding Rate Live Chart\n\nIndeed, during Monday's rally, almost $120M in shorts were liquidated in an hour, which largely confirms that a short squeeze as a primary driving force.\n\nShorts Liquidation Live Chart\nOn-chain Activity Remains Quiet\n\nIn direct contrast to the volatility in spot and derivatives markets, the transaction volume and on-chain activity remains extremely quiet. On a 14-day Median basis, the entity-adjusted transaction volume for Bitcoin remains depressed at around $5B per day. This remains a significant decline from the $16B/day prior to the May Sell-off.\n\nHowever, volume has not yet collapsed to the same extent as the 2017 blow-off top, where network volume saw a full retrace, a subsequent bear market and eventually, a lengthy capitulation. It remains to be seen whether on-chain volumes start to pick up in response to recent volatile price-action.\n\nEA On-chain Volume Live Chart\n\nDespite on-chain transaction volumes falling, when compared to the network valuation (market cap) in the NVT Ratio, we can see an interesting fractal. Historically, very low values of NVT suggest the network is undervalued relative to the amount of transaction volume. Conversely, higher values, as seen back in Feb 2021 indicate transaction volumes are relatively low and may not justify the current market valuation.\n\nAs prices traded down to the lows of $29k at the start of the week, the EA-NVT suggested that the Bitcoin network was relatively oversold compared to on-chain settlement volumes. This short squeeze has now pushed the EA-NVT higher. If on-chain volumes do not rise in support of these elevated prices, it may suggest the rally lacks fundamental drivers and would be a sign for caution.\n\nNote: both the on-chain volume and the NVT charts are shown as entity-adjusted. This filters for only economically meaningful transactions by removing self-spends, wallet management and other internal transfers.\n\nEntity Adjusted NVT Ratio Live Chart\n\nOn the topic of entities, we can see a more constructive spike in receiving entities (those taking custody of coins) whilst sending entities (those spending coins) remains relatively flat. This is an early trend change and one that would indicate a more positive accumulation type environment if it persists. It highlights that of the volume that is transacting, a reasonable portion looks to be accumulation, and relatively little is entities exiting the network.\n\nSending vs Receiving Entities Live Chart\n\nOverall, on-chain activity remains somewhat bearish and continues to be quiet. Perhaps utilisation of the Bitcoin network is lagging prices in this case. Ideally, renewed volatility and constructive price action sparks back demand for block-space. If not, it may suggest a more cautious framework is necessary in the weeks ahead.\n\nNetwork Profitability\n\nTo close out our analysis for the week, we will assess the aggregate market profitability relative to the Realised Price. The Realised Price is one of the principle metrics underlying on-chain analysis. It is calculated by valuing all coins at the price when they were last moved, and thus represents the aggregate 'cost basis' for the circulating coin supply.\n\nThe Realised Price is currently trading at $19.3k, generally coincident with last cycles ATH. With this weeks closing price of $35.4k, it means the aggregate market currently holds an unrealised profit of around 83%.\n\nRealised Price Live Chart\n\nIn the context of past market cycles, we can use the MVRV ratio to compare the market cap (spot valuation) to the realised cap (on-chain cost basis). Here we can see that the MVRV ratio is trading in a zone that is historically reached in three circumstances:\n\nEarly-Bull cycle (3x) where prices have macro bottomed and smart money accumulators have returned to an appreciable profit level.\nMid-Bear cycle (2x) where investors have seen their unrealised profits dramatically slashed following a cycle top, but before the ultimate capitulation.\nDouble Pump (1x) in the 2013 market where the mid-cycle shake-out put enough investors off-side, before swiftly reverting into a powerful blow-off top.\n\nAt this stage, it remains to be seen whether the market can turn the macro trend around and confirm a resumption of the bull market. If so, it would resemble the 2013 'double pump' market. If not, the probability of being a mid-Bear fractal may increase.\n\nMVRV Live Chart\n\nLooking at the MVRV for the short-term holder (STH) cohort, we can see that they are currently holding coins at a significant unrealised loss. The STH-MVRV rarely trades at such oversold conditions with almost all historical instances being followed by significant price rallies. That said, these fractals typically only occur in Bear Markets, noting that this includes the final capitulation event which starts a macro bull.\n\nSTH-MVRV Live Chart\n\nWe can also investigate the volume of supply that has returned to profitability during the short squeeze. This provides us with an estimate of coin volume that has an on-chain cost basis in the $29k to $38k consolidation range. From the weekly low ($29k) to the short squeeze high ($38.4k at the time of writing) over 2.1M BTC has returned to profitability. This represents a volume equivalent to 11.2% of the circulating supply.\n\nSupply in Profit Live Chart\n\nFinally, we review whether there are any signs of older profitable coins being spent on-chain to take advantage of market strength for exit liquidity. What would be relatively bearish is to see a significant increase in older coins (>1yr) spending during this relief rally as was seen in 2018 after the blow-off top.\n\nSo far, we have not seen such behaviour. If general dormancy of older coins persists, it would suggest conviction to HODL remains relatively strong and favour a more constructive view on market structure moving forwards. Conversely, the spending of older coins en mass would indicate a flush of illiquid coins are returning to liquid supply and a more bearish outlook ahead.\n\nSpent Output Age Bands Live Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week on-chain (Week 29, 2021)\n\nAs the probability for high Bitcoin market volatility increases, we analyse the Bull and Bear cases using market and on-chain metrics.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJul 19, 2021 • 9 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market continues its low volatility consolidation this week, with prices trading between a high of $34,564 and a low of $31,125. As the market tests the lows of a significant on-chain support zone, transaction activity remains depressed and HODLing behaviour shows remarkable resilience.\n\nWe have an extremely divided market, and one with a likely expansion of volatility just around the corner. As such, in this weeks edition, we explore both the Bull and Bear cases using a combination of market and on-chain metrics.\n\nSetting the stage\n\nTo start our analysis, we will begin with the UTXO Realised Price Distribution metric, which presents an on-chain volume profile across pricing buckets. Zones where significant clusters of volume arise, can indicate that a large number of coins changed hands at those prices, and thus represents a concentration of cost basis.\n\nBetween $31.0k and $34.3k, coin volume equivalent to 10.5% of the circulating supply (1.973M BTC) have transacted, outsizing the previous high volume node established in the $50k-$60k range. However, the market is trading at the lower end of this support node and there are few comparatively few on-chain support levels below until $18.8k.\n\nURPD Live Chart\nThe Bearish Case for Bitcoin\n\nWe will start our bearish case by considering institutional demand flows which continue to be a necessary source of capital inflows to reach and sustain higher valuations. In the limelight this week will be the performance of the Grayscale GBTC product with around 31.9k GBTC shares unlocking through the remainder of July.\n\nThe GBTC market price continued to trade at a notable discount last week, ranging between -11.0% and down to -15.3%. Whilst the discount has recovered from the absolute lows of -21.3% to NAV, any significant and persistent discount suggests lacklustre demand, and can also attract capital away from spot BTC markets.\n\nGBTC Premium Live Chart\n\nThe Purpose ETF has also seen a slow-down in net inflows this week, after a period of relatively strong demand through May and June. The week closed with the largest net outflow of -90.76 BTC since mid-May. Similar to the GBTC product, this indicates institutional demand remains relatively weak across these regulated products.\n\nPurpose ETF Flows Live Chart\n\nLast on the institutional demand side, OTC desk holdings have seen a net inflow of around 1,780 BTC over the last two weeks, moving against the structural trend of outflows in place since November 2020. It remains to be seen whether this net inflow is just a short-term impact, or the early signs of a reversal in the balance of supply and demand.\n\nOTC Desk Holdings Live Chart\n\nOn-chain activity remains extremely muted this week with mempools clearing, and transaction volumes continuing to fall. As the mempool empties, the average block size has fallen by 15% to 20%, down to 1.103M bytes.\n\nThis indicates that demand for Bitcoin block-space and on-chain settlement is low, mined blocks are not full, and the utilisation of the network is relatively low.\n\nMean Block Size Live Chart\n\nEntity-adjusted on-chain volume (14-day EMA basis) remains down 65.8% from the highs in April. The Bitcoin network is currently settling $5.3B/day compared to the $15.5B in daily volume settled at the 2021 peak. This demonstrates relatively low demand for value settlement remains in place.\n\nEA Transfer Volume Live Chart\n\nOf the transaction volume that is being settled, a dominant majority appear to be coins realising losses. If we compare the total value of realised losses and profits, we see losses (pink) have consistently been larger than profits (green) since the sell-off in May.\n\nMedian losses this week were around $353M per day, more than 2.2x greater than the $158M/day in realised profits. Whilst these volumes are much lower than the two capitulation events ($1.60B and $744M respectively), this demonstrates that investors holding underwater positions continue to spend and sell their coins.\n\nRealised Loss/Profit Comparison Chart\n\nWe can also assess how much of the coin supply remains underwater to gauge how much supply may become additional sell-side pressure.\n\nThe chart below shows that approximately 6.2M BTC, equivalent to 33% of the circulating supply is currently holding an unrealized loss.\n\nSupply at a Loss live Chart\n\nFinally, to close out our bearish case, we can see that the number of new on-chain entities is still down 28.6% from the highs set in February 2021. The decline is not yet as severe as it was after the 2017 blow-off top, however it remains to be seen if this metric stabilises, or declines further.\n\nSummary of Bear Case\nMarket is trading at the low end of a high on-chain volume cluster with very little cost basis support between $31.0k and $18.8k.\nGBTC discount persists, declining Purpose ETF inflows and OTC desk inflows suggest lacklustre institutional demand.\nOn-chain activity (volume and entities) remains significantly down from the highs. Utilisation of the Bitcoin network for value transfer suggests low demand.\nLosses continue to be realised on-chain and a total of 6.2M are currently held at an unrealised loss. These coins may well form overhead resistance and sell-pressure.\nThe Bull Case for Bitcoin\n\nAfter painting a relatively bleak picture with respect to immediate demand and network utilisation, there remain positive signs across many on-chain metrics, particularly longer range indicators and supply metrics.\n\nTo start, lets return to the idea of on-chain entities, a topic which has been the source of some confusion of late. We define:\n\nAn Entity as a unique on-chain cluster of associated addresses. If a cluster of addresses interact and demonstrate heuristics to suggest a single owner, they will be classified as a single entity.\n\nThe chart below presents three metrics telling a holistic picture for on-chain entities:\n\nSending Entities (green) are often associated with UTXO destruction. Most wallets enforce single-use addresses when spending, which typically reduces the entity count. At present, we see fewer spending entities indicating less spending of UTXOs and a preference for HODLing.\nReceiving Entities (pink) are the converse, associated with UTXO creation, new owners, and new accumulation. June and July have seen strong growth in receiving entities.\nNet Entities Growth (blue) takes the difference between 'destroyed' and 'created' entities. Given 'destroyed entities' is declining and 'created entities' are increasing, we have a positive aggregate Net Growth.\n\nTo summarise: more HODLing and less spending; likely reflecting an environment similar to dollar cost average style accumulation.\n\nChange in Entities Analysis Live Chart\n\nTo support this observation, we can see that the exchange net position change has reverted back to a net outflow after a significant period of net inflows. Exchanges are currently seeing a rate of net outflows of around 36.3k BTC per month.\n\nExchange Net Position Change Live Chart\n\nMiners are also demonstrating extreme resilience and desire to accumulate, despite the extraordinary costs incurred as the Great Migration carries on. It is possible that additional sell-side pressure from offline distressed miners is being more than offset by the extraordinary profitability by remaining operational miners.\n\nMiner Net Position Change Live Chart\n\nIf we observe the volume of supply held by 'strong hands', we can see that HODLing appears to be the preferred strategy. Long-Term Holders currently hold 75% of the circulating supply (6% at a loss, 69% in profit).\n\nThe bullish squeeze that started past bull markets has historically been triggered by LTHs holding 65% (2x 2013), 75% (2017), and 80% (2020) of the circulating supply.\n\nIf the current rate of coin maturation (14.75k BTC/day) persists, LTHs would hold 80% of the coin supply in around 2-months (although this is not likely to play quite so cleanly, since we know many coins from Mar-May were spent and sold).\n\nRelative LTH Supply in Profit/Loss Live Chart\n\nThe Illiquid Supply Change metric supports this observation following a dramatic reversal from distribution in May, to HODLing and accumulation in June-July.\n\nNote, positive values (green) of this metric are a result of widespread coin dormancy (more illiquid coins) with limited spending. Conversely, negative values occur when illiquid coins are spent back into liquid circulation.\n\nFinally, to round out the Bullish case for Bitcoin, we turn to the Realised Cap HODL waves which shows unmistakable indicators of HODLing, coin maturation, and further evidence to the probability of an potential supply squeeze in the works. There are two primary observations:\n\nStructural, multi-month declines in younger coin bands (red-orange) which can only occur when young coins make up a smaller proportion of 'realised value'. This occurs when young coins mature and age to become older coins, which creates;\nSwelling of older coin bands (yellow, 3m-12m) as the volume of coins held at these stronger hand, LTH classified age brackets grows. A decline in these bands without corresponding growth of the next oldest band would start to invalidate this thesis.\nRealised Cap HODL waves Live Chart\nSummary of Bull Case\nNet Entity growth remains positive as fewer entities are destroyed, and more are created. This resembles a 'dollar cost average' style accumulation environment.\nExchanges have seen net outflows after an extended period of inflows since mid-May.\nMiners are in net accumulation suggesting sell pressure due to the Great migration is being mitigated or offset by accumulation by profitable miners.\nLong-term holders and bull market HODLers appear unshaken by volatility and lower prices. The volume of coins held in illiquid state continues to grow, and the potential supply squeeze is coming from a much higher base than the 2018-19 bear. This demonstrates the remarkable conviction of BTC holders to weather extreme volatility.\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 28, 2021)\n\nThe Bitcoin market squeezes into a tight trading range and we assess a range of market indicators for sentiment and volatility triggers.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJul 12, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nIt has been an impressively quiet week in the Bitcoin market as volatility continues to seep out, and prices squeeze into a tight consolidation range. The week opened at a high of $35,128, and traded down to a low of $32,227. It is starting to feel like the calm before the storm as muted and quiet activity appears across both spot, derivative, and on-chain metrics.\n\nThis week we will explore a broad range of metrics and indicators across the entire Bitcoin market to establish overall sentiment, volatility triggers, and models for investor behaviour.\n\nEarly Signs of Miner Recovery\n\nA key theme of the previous two editions of this newsletter have focused on the changing conditions across the Bitcoin mining market (see Weeks 26 and 27). A key takeaway in establishing a bullish or bearish bias is the speed at which hash-rate recovers.\n\nRapid hash-rate recovery may suggest offline miners have successfully relocated or re-established their hardware, recovering costs and likely reducing the risk of treasury liquidation sell-pressure.\nSlow hash-rate recovery may suggest the converse, where costs and outage continues to take a financial toll, and thus increases the risk of treasury sales.\n\nThis week, the hash-rate has recovered from the peak-trough decline of 55%, to around a 39% decline. Should this level hold and be representative, it would indicate that hash-power equivalent to around ~29% of the affected hash-power has come back online. This could be due to:\n\nMiners in China that have successfully relocated hardware,\nPreviously obsolete hardware has been dusted off and found a new lease on life.\nMean Hash-rate Live Chart\n\nWe previously noted that miners who remained operational at this time would experience a dramatic boost in profitability, minimising the compulsory sell-pressure. To support this thesis, the Miner Net Position Change metric has returned to accumulation. This indicates that what sell-side pressure is coming from offline miners, is more than offset by accumulation by the operational miners.\n\nA major downside change to this metric would suggest financial stress is affecting the mining market and likely foreshadow an increase in liquid supply.\n\nMiner Net Position Change Live Chart\nDepletion of Exchange Reserves\n\nA key theme throughout 2020 and Q1 2021 was relentless depletion of exchange coin reserves, with many of them en route to the Grayscale GBTC Trust, or accumulated by institutions. This showed up as a persistent net outflow from exchanges.\n\nThroughout May, this trend dramatically reversed as a flood of BTC was deposited to exchanges, alongside the market selling off by ~50%. On a 14-day moving average basis, the last two weeks in particular have seen a more positive return to exchange outflows, at a rate of ~2k BTC per day.\n\nExchange Net Flow Live Chart\n\nAs volatility squeezes out of the market, it is common for mempools to clear and demand for block-space to decline. As such, the transactions that are executed tend to represent a less speculative and more 'purposeful' sample compared to a frothy bull market.\n\nThis week, the proportion of on-chain transaction fees associated with exchange deposits declined to 14% dominance after a brief peak to around 17%. Continuation of this as a structural trend may reinforce a thesis sell-side pressure is subsiding.\n\nExchange Fee Dominance Live Chart\n\nConversely, the proportion of on-chain fees associated with withdrawals saw a notable bounce from 3.7% up to 5.4%, a 43% boost in relative dominance. This too suggests a rising preference for accumulation over sales.\n\nNote that deposit fee dominance will generally be larger than withdrawals in magnitude, generally as a result of exchanges deploying batching techniques for efficiency, including many customer withdrawals under a single transaction and fee.\n\nExchange Fee Dominance Live Chart\n\nLast on exchanges, the aggregate balance has fallen by around 40k BTC over the past three weeks. This represents approximately 28% of the total inflow of 140k BTC observed since the local low set in April. Exchange balances we track are currently holding 2.56M coins.\n\nExchange Balance Live Chart\nDerivatives Quieten Off\n\nAcross derivative markets, we see relatively quiet conditions as open interest stalls, and trading volumes continue to decline. Given the heavy influence of derivatives markets in the leverage flush back in May, this suggests a reduced appetite for leveraged speculation.\n\nSince the sell-off in May, futures open interest has remained bound between $10.7B and $13.0B with only a handful of notable builds or declines within that range. Open interest remains 57% below the ATH set in April as Coinbase went public.\n\nFutures Open Interest Live Chart\n\nVolumes across futures markets are also in decline, falling back to $45B traded per day. These volume levels were last seen in Q1 2021 where prices were trading in a similar range ($29k to $38k). This puts current volumes 62.5% and 49% lower than the May (#1) and June (#2) capitulations, respectively.\n\nFutures Volume Live Chart\n\nOptions markets are experiencing a similar slow-down, with open interest falling by over 67% since typical highs of $13.2B in March and April. Current options open interest is at $4.4B, returning to December 2020 levels.\n\nWith such a significant decline across all derivatives markets, it becomes increasingly likely that market volatility will be driven by spot volumes, rather than short/long squeezes or leveraged liquidations. Thus the direction of the next large move is likely to strongly reflect underlying supply and demand (rather than a speculative premium/discount).\n\nOptions Open Interest Live Chart\nSupply Dynamics\n\nNow that we have covered miners, exchange flows, and derivatives markets, we finally turn to dynamics of existing holders of the coin supply. Here we are looking for the balance of spending and holding patterns to assess investor sentiment and conviction.\n\nThe ASOL metric captures the average age of spent outputs in a daily basis. Being that ASOL considers only the average age of spent outputs (not coin volumes), it is largely unaffected by quiet mempools. The chart below also uses entity adjustment to filter out exchanges and similar economic entities who often use low on-chain fee environments for wallet consolidation and management.\n\nSimilar to the 2017 and 2019 peaks, the average age of spent outputs is rapidly collapsing, indicative of a return to higher conviction HODLing and likely accumulation (noting it takes time for a subsequent accumulation supply squeeze to manifest).\n\nEA-ASOL Live Chart\n\nASOL suggests that overall, older coins are increasingly dormant. The HODL waves provide more data-points to support this thesis.\n\nThe chart below filtered for coins aged between 2y and 5y. These age bands reflect two groups of strong conviction buyers, both of which held through significant volatility:\n\n2y-3y Holders accumulated in the bear market from late 2018 through to the 2019 peak. These investors currently hold 9.8% of the supply.\nSince March 2020, 5.2% of the circulating supply has 'matured' from the 2y-3y band into the 3y-5y band.\n3y-5y Holders accumulated between July 2016 and July 2018, and thus represent last cycles bull market buyers. This cohort continues to grow, now representing 13.1% of the supply. These investors bought between $640 and the previous ATH at $20k and have held through significant volatility.\nHODL Waves Live Chart\n\nFor middle aged coins (6m to 2y old), we can see that through Q1 of this year, these investors were largely distributing (declining waves). The accumulation range for those Q1 sellers extends as far back as January 2019 after the 2018 capitulation to $3k (thus capturing a tidy profit multiple).\n\nThese cohorts appear to have recently commenced a switch in behaviour, from spending, into a holding pattern. Coins aged 1y-2y currently represent 13.3% of the supply and were accumulated from mid-2019 to mid-2020. After a distributing heavily in Q1, their holdings plateaued, indicating a slow down of spending.\n\nCoins aged 6m-12m are this cycles bull market buyers and now hold 9% of the coin supply. This age band has started to notably swell starting in early April, indicating that a large proportion of buyers from Nov-Dec 2020 have not spent their coins.\n\nThe evolution of these 'middle aged' HODL waves over the next three months will be key to appreciating how much of the 'early institutional supply' remains tightly held, or conversely, was sold over recently.\n\nHODL Waves Live Chart\n\nFinally, we investigate the youngest economically meaningful coins, those aged between 1m and 6m. These represent bull market buyers who were generally buying coins off older hands realising profits. This behaviour is evident from Nov 2020 to May 2021 as young coin supply swelled from ~22% to over 32%.\n\nHowever, since the sell-off in May, the young coin supply has commenced a structural downtrend which indicates coins are maturing, HODLing is taking place, and accumulation is likely underway.\n\nIt is favourable for price if young coin supply continues to decline (old coins dormant and young coins maturing). Conversely, large spikes in young coin supply suggests renewed distribution and would favour a a bearish bias.\n\nHODL Waves Live Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 27, 2021)\n\nThe Great Hash-power Migration is underway as an estimated 50% of Bitcoin miners are offline and on the move. We assess the magnitude of this event observed in the on-chain data.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJul 5, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has traded slightly higher this week, albeit still within the trading range established since mid-May. Price traded between the weekly high of $36,460 and a low of 32,775, as volatility declines whilst price consolidates.\n\nAs volatility seeps out of the Bitcoin price, it has notably ramped up in the mining industry, as the Bitcoin network adjusts to an incredible decline in hash-power during the Great Migration. This week the protocol experienced the largest difficulty adjustment in history, adjusting down 27.94%.\n\nThe resilience of the Bitcoin protocol is remarkable. This week, blocks continued to be mined, transactions continued to be settled, all whilst ~50% if its industrial base relocates, and reallocates capital to new jurisdictions. This week we will focus on a number of on-chain mining metrics that help characterise and gauge the magnitude of this incredible shift that is underway.\n\nSizing Up the Mining Shift\n\nThis week we saw plenty of volatility coming into in mining metrics, as the impact of the mining ban in China reaches full swing. When a significant proportion of hash-power comes offline, blocks will be mined at a slower pace until the difficulty adjusts downwards. This realigns the complexity of the mining puzzle to the average hash-power observed over the 2016 block difficulty window (~14-days).\n\nThis week, the average block interval on a 24-hr average basis spiked to a short term high of 1,958s (32.6mins), over 226% longer than the 600s target block-time. This event was only temporary on 28-June, with average block-times since recovering to an average between 800s to 900s.\n\nMean Block Interval Live Chart\n\nIf we zoom out, we can see that this was the slowest average block-time since the 2009 cypherpunk era where Bitcoin did not even have a market price. The previous longest average block-time of 1,774.5s occurred at the bottom of the final pull-back before the 2017 blow-off top.\n\nBlock Interval Live Chart\n\nTo estimate the magnitude of the hash-power shift underway, we can consider the change in estimated hash-rate since the stable peak observed in April to early May 2021. Note that hash-rate is estimated as a derivative of block-time and difficulty, and here we have used a 24-hr moving average to smooth out some of the natural variability.\n\nHash-rate on the network was typically around 180 EH/s at the peak, and fell off to a local low of 65 EH/s (aligned with the 1,958s average block-time on 28-June).\n\nHash-rate has since recovered and stabilised around the 88 to 110 EH/s range, reflecting an overall decline of 38% to 49% of hash-power. This provides a gauge on the proportion of the network that is currently offline and affected by the ban in China.\n\nHash-rate Live Chart\n\nNow that protocol difficulty has adjusted down, we can see the Difficulty Ribbon has inverted to the deepest extent since the 2018 bear market capitulation. A difficulty ribbon inversion is an extremely uncommon event where the faster moving averages of difficulty (9D, 14D etc) fall below the longer term moving average (128D, 200D).\n\nA difficulty ribbon inversion typically represent a miner capitulation event, usually observed at the end of bear markets, or after halving events when miner incomes are squeezed, and profitability takes a hit. It is a result of miners switching off the machines that are costing more than they are making, and has historically correlated with strong bullish market reversals.\n\nDifficulty Ribbon Live Chart\nMiner Revenues Get a Boost\n\nWhilst difficulty ribbon inversions are historically bullish events, in this instance, the huge logistical costs incurred by Chinese miners may necessitate spending of accumulated BTC treasuries, creating sell pressure. However, it is important to note that there is somewhat of a counter-balance in the uplift in revenues for the remaining ~50% of operational miners.\n\nWhen Bitcoin was trading in the $50k to $60k range in April, hash-rate was at its peak, and the aggregate mining industry saw incomes of $50M to $60M per day. Whilst prices have since declined by around 50%, the miners who remain operational have just seen an estimated 38% to 49% of their competition switch off in the short-term.\n\nThe daily aggregate revenue now around $25M to $30M per day, but is shared amongst a smaller pool of miners. Same daily BTC issuance, fewer competitors to share the spoils.\n\nThis implies that following the latest difficulty adjustment, operational miners are incurring the same OPEX expense, but are seeing profitability rise almost 2x, approaching similar profitability levels to back in April.\n\nDaily Miner Revenue Live Chart\n\nThe Miner Outflow Multiple tracks the rate of miner spending relative to their yearly average. From this we can see miners have dramatically slowed their spending of late, even amidst the Great Migration. Historically, we have seen the following cyclical patterns in miner spending behaviour:\n\nHODLing in Bear Markets (green) where miners reach a stable steady distribution pattern (flat Outflow Multiple).\nIncreased distribution in Bull Markets (red) as miners take advantage of bull market strength and sell at an accelerating pace (rising Outflow Multiple).\nDeclining distribution after Market Tops (blue) as miners slow down their spending perhaps due to increasing conviction, or a desire to limit excessive the sell-pressure (declining Outflow Multiple).\n\nImpressively, even during the Great Migration, we are yet to see a significant increase to miner spending behaviour. The speed of hash-rate recovery will provide further insight to this as:\n\nA quick hash-rate recovery indicates Chinese miners have successfully relocated, liquidated hardware, or otherwise recovered costs, reducing the risk of treasury BTC sales.\nA slow prolonged hash-rate recovery indicates the inverse, and increases the odds that costs are being carried, debts are accumulating, and thus creating a higher probability for miner BTC sales.\nMiner Outflow Multiple Live Chart\n\nIn fact since early 2020, the macro spending behaviour of miners has changed dramatically. For almost all of Bitcoins trading history, miners have consistently spent more coins than they accumulated such that unspent supply was in a structural downtrend.\n\nThis means that miners historically spent more coins than they accumulated.\n\nThe chart below shows the unspent miner supply (i.e. coinbase transactions that have never moved) plotted against its 365-day moving average. From mid 2020, the structural downtrend in miner distribution, appears to have not only flattened out, but reversed. The unspent BTC in coinbase outputs is now above its yearly average.\n\nThis suggests that miners have begun accumulating in a way the market has not seen to date. Given the timing of this event, there are likely a number of factors to consider behind this:\n\nThe macro monetary landscape supporting the case for Bitcoin became globally apparent in 2020, increasing miner conviction.\nMiners have access to vastly superior financing options such as coin collateralised debt, and liquid options and futures markets to hedge risk.\nReduced ASIC miner production due to constraints on global chip fabrication capacity. As price rises, existing hash-power becomes increasingly profitable as little new competition can come to market.\n\nAs prices rallied in the bull market, BTC mining is likely to have been (and still be) particularly lucrative through this halving epoch.\n\nMiner Unspent Supply Live Chart\nScarcer than Gold\n\nMany analysts have pointed out this week that the Puell Multiple, an indicator for miner profitability, also dropped into the 'undervalued zone'. The Puell Multiple is calculated by taking the ratio between daily aggregate USD miner revenue, and its 365-day moving average.\n\nHigh Puell Multiples indicate strong profitability and thus high incentives for miners to sell thus increasing liquid coin supply on the market.\nLow Puell Multiples indicate poor profitability, miner capitulation and the gaining in share of hash-power by stronger miners, eventually leading to a supply squeeze.\n\nLike the Difficulty Ribbon inversion, this is a rare event, having happened only five times in history, usually during generational market capitulation events.\n\nNote: The Puell Multiple has a revised Glassnode Academy Entry with detailed explaination of both the metric, but also the mining market mechanics it describes.\n\nPuell Multiple Live Chart\n\nHowever, as is the case for many metrics, who doesn't love a little bit of nuance?\n\nThe principle reason the Puell Multiple dropped like a stone, (and then promptly reversed) is actually a technical one:\n\nBlock-times slowed down by 226% on 28-June.\nThis means only 58 of the target 144 blocks were mined that day (40%).\nAs a result, only 40% of the expected BTC was issued that day making aggregate miner revenues fall by 60%.\nThe difficulty adjustment has since corrected this.\n\nIn fact the issuance rate of Bitcoin fell to an all time low of 0.71%, making for a stock-to-flow ratio of 140. Bitcoin was technically 2.37x scarcer than gold (S2F of 59)...if just for one day...\n\nBitcoin Inflation Rate Live Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.\n\nWe have also introduced our new markdown text feature to this dashboard to provide commentary, and bullish / bearish indicators to keep an eye out for throughout the week.\n\nBe sure to check out the Week 26 dashboard alongside our New Video Analysis.\n\nWeek 26 Video Analysis Report\nNew Glassnode Content\nDeFi Uncovered: Does DeFi Outperform ETH?\n\nWe have released a new content series focused on insights and analysis pertaining to the rapidly expanding DeFi sector.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 26, 2021)\n\nThe Bitcoin market continues to fight for support as mining sell pressure increases, institutional demand remains slow, and a second capitulation occurs.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJun 28, 2021 • 9 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market is working hard to hold the lows of the present trading range established since the sell-off in mid-May. The market traded down to a new local low of $28,993 early in the week before recovering to set an intra-day high of $35,487.\n\nAs mining hash-power continues to drop off the network during the largest migration of mining hardware in history, Bitcoin holders market wide appear to have capitulated at the lows once again. The market realised the largest absolute losses in history and we explore the cross section of the market most affected.\n\nThis week we also assess the overall demand dynamics related to institutions such as Grayscale's GBTC, various ETF products and the coin balance on Coinbase.\n\nCapitulation Round 2\n\nAfter breaking new records on absolute dollar denominated losses in May, the market capitulated yet again this week, realising a new ATH of $3.45B in losses. Losses are realised on-chain when a coin that was last moved (UTXO created) at higher prices is spent again at lower prices (UTXO destroyed), assuming it was sold for a loss. Note that as the Bitcoin market increases in valuation, larger absolute dollar values of profit and loss are possible.\n\nWhat this means is that a very large volume of coins that were underwater were spent this week. Note that almost all Long-Term Holders are in profit and their spending actually offset around $383M in net losses (total realised loss was $3.833B!).  Currently only 2.44% of the circulating supply is held by LTHs at an unrealised loss.\n\nNet Realised Profit/Loss Live chart\n\nOn a more relative basis, we can look to the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) to observe how this second capitulation compares on a relative basis. We look at SOPR metrics for two cohorts, Long- and Short-term holders. These two metrics have the same calculation, but need slightly different interpretations:\n\nLong-Term Holder SOPR (left, orange) may be thought of as the profit multiple realised as LTHs are generally well in the green. A LTH-SOPR value of 1.95 means on aggregate, long-term holders realised profits of 195% (an average cost basis around $16.3k at current prices).\nShort-Term Holder SOPR (right, blue) generally oscillates around a value of 1.0 as a result of coins recently moved being re-spent during market volatility. Falling to values well below 1.0 (and sustaining it) indicates significant losses are realised by this cohort.\n\nThis weeks downside price action appears to have created a panic in both LTHs and STHs as demonstrated by the volatility in LTH-SOPR, and deep capitulation in STH-SOPR. STHs have realised losses only slightly less than in the March 2020 capitulation event. LTHs were willing to spend coins with an average cost basis fluctuating between $9.2k and $16.3k this week, suggesting a high degree of uncertainty.\n\nHowever, despite some evidence LTHs who spent coins were panic selling, almost all 'lifespan' based metrics that track coin age continue to break down towards pre-bull levels. One way we can interpret the above pieces of information are:\n\nSome LTHs spent their coins during market volatility, likely in a panic based on the spread of cost basis.\nMost LTHs did not spend their coins and thus the average age of coins that were on the move remains very young (despite the market realising $3.45B in net losses).\nSell pressure is largely STHs who are almost entirely holding coins at an unrealised loss. 23.5% of all circulating supply are owned by STHs and underwater, compared with 3.4% that are in profit.\nASOL, Dormancy and CDD from the HODLers Dashboard\nMiner Sell Pressure\n\nAs the largest migration in Bitcoin hash-power in history takes place, the market has been speculating as to the magnitude of miner sell pressure that may be creating headwinds for prices. There are two primary factors that may be driving an increase in miner sell pressure:\n\nDramatic decline in revenue to the recent ~50% mark-down in prices leading to more coin sold to cover the same fiat denominated costs.\nLogistical expenses and risk incurred by miners to relocate or liquidate mining equipment necessitating liquidation of BTC held in their treasuries. These expenses are likely to be ongoing for some months.\n\nTo start our analysis, we can assess the change in aggregate miner revenue (7DMA). This demonstrates that the mining market has experienced an approximately 65.5% decline in revenues since levels sustained in March and April. The 7-day average mining revenue currently sits at around $20.73M/day, which in context, is still 154% higher than it was at the time of the back-to-back halvings in 2020.\n\nMining Revenue Live Chart\n\nOver this same period, mining difficulty has only increased by only 23.6%. The mismatch between revenue and difficulty is primarily a result of the global shortage in semi-conductors that has limited the ability of miners to expand their operations. In practice, this mean that mining Bitcoin has been exceptionally profitable throughout 2021, and that some mining hardware that would otherwise be obsolete, remains profitable. This means fewer coins need to be sold to cover costs and miner treasury reserves can be built up.\n\nThe Bitcoin mining puzzle is 23.6% harder despite revenues being up 154% on a 7-day average basis. Since a very large proportion of hash-power is currently offline and in transit, and the next difficulty adjustment is estimated to be -25%. As such, miners who remain operational are likely to become even more profitable over the coming weeks, unless price corrects further or migrating hash-power comes back online.\n\nMining Difficulty Live Chart\n\nThis largely indicates that miners who are in operation are unlikely to exert excessive compulsory selling (Point 1) and thus it is more probable that Chinese miners liquidating treasuries is the dominant sell-side source (Point 2).\n\nThus, the second question is whether miners are liquidating their treasuries to cover the incurred risks and costs to relocate hash-power. Here we take a look at the aggregate balance held in miner wallets and see that in aggregate, miners have added 10k BTC to their treasuries since the low on 27-Jan. This represents 7.6% of all coins mined since then and indicates that miners generally have distributed 92.4% of their coins over this period.\n\nWe can also see an overall spend of 7k BTC that occurred in early June which may well be a miner or set of miners liquidating coins in preparation for the migration.\n\nMiner Balance Live Chart\n\nWe can also track the rate of miners sending coins to exchanges to assess relative sell pressure. Here we use a 14-day moving average to smooth the data over the same period as the difficulty adjustment window.\n\nRelative to 2020 and Q1 2021, miner sell pressure on exchanges has actually been notably less than the 300 to 500 BTC/day sustained over that period. Current miner inflows to exchanges has steadily declined from over 500 BTC/day in March to under 200 BTC/day in June.\n\nMiner to Exchanges Live Chart\n\nWe also review the balance on the OTC desks we monitor, representing another principal destination for miners coins to match with larger buyers. Throughout 2021, there has been a progressive 'step-down' in OTC balances, with each leg down typically correlated with changes in market trend. From April to June, a total OTC balance of between 8k and 6k BTC has been maintained, with a net outflow of ~1,134 BTC over the last two weeks.\n\nBalance on OTC Desks Live Chart\nInstitutional Demand Remains Slow\n\nA primary driver for Bitcoin price appreciation in 2020 and 2021 was both the narrative, and the reality of institutional demand. One of the largest factors in this was the one-way flow of coins into Grayscale's GBTC trust fund as traders sought to arbitrage the high premium observed in 2020 and early 2021.\n\nSince Feb 2021, the GBTC product has reversed to trade at a persistent discount to NAV, hitting the deepest discount of -21.23% in mid-May. Following the subsequent sell-off, the GBTC discount has started to close up, trading this week between a low of -14.44%, and a high of -4.83% to NAV.\n\nGrayscale's GBTC trust currently holds over 651.5k BTC, a whopping 3.475% of the circulation Bitcoin supply.\n\nGrayscale GBTC Premium Live Chart\n\nThere are two Bitcoin ETF products available in Canada which may also provide insight into institutional demand:\n\nThe Purpose Bitcoin ETF\nThe 3iQ Digital Asset Management QBTC ETF\n\nThe Purpose ETF has continued to grow in total BTC under management, with net inflows of 3,929 BTC since 15-May. This represents a daily inflow of 95.83 BTC/day (using a 7-day week) and brings the total ETF holdings up to 21,597 BTC.\n\nPurpose ETF Holdings Live Chart\n\nMeanwhile, the QBTC ETF has seen significant net outflows over the last two months. Total holdings have declined in two notable steps by a total of -10,483 BTC. This brings current holdings down to 12,975 BTC.\n\nAs such, the Purpose ETF has now flipped the QBTC ETF in total coins under management. Nevertheless, when combining the net flows for both ETFs over the last month, a total of -8,037 BTC have flowed out of these ETF products.\n\nQBTC Holdings Live chart\n\nFinally on the institutional front, we can observe the net change in the coin balance held on Coinbase, a preferred venue for US institutions during the bull market. After a sustained period of net outflows since Dec 2020, the change in Coinbase balance has flattened out markedly.\n\nBetween observations of the GBTC premium, net outflows from the combined Purpose and QBTC ETFs, and a stagnant Coinbase balance, institutional demand appears to remain somewhat lacklustre.\n\nExchange Balance Live Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.\n\nWe have also introduced our new markdown text feature to this dashboard to provide commentary, and bullish / bearish indicators to keep an eye out for throughout the week.\n\nNew Glassnode Content\nDeFi Uncovered: Does DeFi Outperform ETH?\n\nWe have released a new content series focused on insights and analysis pertaining to the rapidly expanding DeFi sector.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 25, 2021)\n\nOn-chain activity has fallen back to levels not seen in twelve months, just as a seismic shift in Bitcoin hash-rate commences in China.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJun 21, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market continues to show relative weakness in both price and on-chain activity this week. Prices have traded within the recent consolidation range, marking down from an early week high of $41,295, to a low of $33,818 over the weekend.\n\nOn-chain activity across the board is remarkably low across Bitcoin and Ethereum, with demand for block-space falling to levels last seen in 2020. However, whilst low demand for transactions is a generally bearish insight, it also reflects an unwillingness of strong hands to spend at these prices. Are they waiting for a relief rally?\n\nSimultaneously, a seismic shift is underway in the Chinese mining markets as multiple regions enforce bans on the industry. This week we will explore the observable on-chain impact of both changes in hash-power, and in miner spending behaviour.\n\nTumbleweeds On-chain\n\nIt is very quite on-chain.\n\nBoth Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced dramatic slow-downs in on-chain activity with active addresses and total transfer volume falling back to 2020 and early 2021 levels. Bitcoin active addresses have fallen by 24% from the generally sustained peak of 1.16M from March to early May. The current activity of 884k addresses was last seen this time last year.\n\nFor Ethereum, the fall in active addresses has been even larger, dropping 30% from the brief peak of around 676k addresses. Activity is now down to 474k addresses/day, last seen in Q1 2021.\n\nBTC vs ETH Active Addresses Live Chart\n\nWhen it comes to USD value settled on the networks, the decline in activity is even more dramatic. Both Bitcoin (change-adjusted) and Ethereum (ETH transfers) are settling -63% and -68% less USD value respectively, compared to the recent highs set in May.\n\nBitcoin is settling around $18.3B per day, whilst Ethereum is settling $5B/day in ETH transfers, both demonstrating equivalent volume to Q1 2021.\n\nBTC vs ETH Transfer Volume Live Chart\n\nNaturally, the priority fees for inclusion in the next block have fallen significantly as network congestion almost completely clears. Bitcoin total fees paid have fallen to just under 30BTC/day (~$1.2M), coincident with levels in late 2019 and early 2020. This currently represents around 4% of miner revenue with the block-subsidy making up the remaining 96%.\n\nBitcoin Total Transaction Fees (BTC) Live Chart\n\nFor Ethereum, daily fee revenue has fallen from over 15k ETH/day in early May to just 1.9k ($4.34M). This represents around 10% of total miner revenue being sourced from transaction fees. We have to look as far back as June 2020, before 'DeFi Summer', to find similar levels of transaction fees paid.\n\nETH Total Transaction Fees (ETH) Live Chart\nSupply and Spending Behaviour\n\nFrom a macro perspective, there are remarkable similarities to the 2017 macro peak in regards to the balance of supply held by Long (blue) and Short (red) Term Holders. The chart below shows the relative supply held by each cohort and whether they are in profit (dark colours) or loss (light colours).\n\nAfter reaching 'Peak HODL' (maximum LTH supply), both cycles demonstrated a macro distribution event, as BTC wealth is transferred from Long term to Short term holders. After the top was put in, we have started to see the opposite effect, where Long-term holders stop spending and begin re-accumulating, despite their coins often falling into an unrealised loss.\n\nSince the $64k top, Long-term holders own an additional 5.25% of the circulating supply of which 1.5% of this is currently underwater (held at an unrealised loss). Despite prices approaching the cost basis for many long-term holders, they continue to HODL on.\n\nRelative LTH vs STH Supply in Profit/Loss Live Chart\n\nIf we investigate aggregate spending behaviour over the last year, we see the proportion of young coins (those < 1yr old, excl. < 1day) on the move has continued to increase as a proportion of transaction flow. In the last few months, we see younger coins accounting for over 45% of the total transaction count. This is most likely a result of newer market entrants:\n\nBuying the euphoric top and then,\nSelling in capitulation and amidst the current choppy conditions.\n\nWhat this metric does show that most of the current on-chain activity is due to buyers from the last 6-months spending their coins and realising losses.\n\nSpent Output Age Bands Live Chart\n\nConversely, older coins (those > 1yr old) have reduced their spending, with a notable decline after the May sell-off. This demonstrates the two sided reality of empty mempools:\n\n1) Demand for on-chain settlement is extremely low (generally bearish)\n\n2) However, this also indicates that long-term investors are not bailing out at these prices (neutral to bullish)\n\nThe Spent Output Age bands are a particularly useful tool to have on hand should the market experience a strong rally or further capitulation. A primary behaviour to watch out for is in an event where these older coins come roaring back to life, such as on a relief rally. If so, it may indicate that old hand investors are exiting into liquidity or panic selling (bearish). If not, and their coins stay dormant during volatility, it would be a strong indication that conviction to hold remains in play (bullish).\n\nWe explore this and many other cyclical metrics to identify bullish/bearish trends in our article on Bitcoins On-chain Cycles.\n\nSpent Output Age Bands Live Chart\n\nTo confirm just how insignificant the spending behaviour of all coins is, we can look to the Binary CDD metric with a 7-day moving average applied. This metric will trend higher when the volume of coin-days destroyed is larger than the long term average. More coin-days are destroyed when older coins and/or large BTC size are moved on-chain.\n\nBinary CDD has fallen so low that only 1 in every 7-days is experiencing lifespan destruction above the long term average. This state has persisted for almost all of June and commenced relatively quickly after the May sell-off indicating old hands are reluctant to sell at these prices. It also highlights how little demand for block-space there is.\n\nThe entire market appears to be waiting for the next move, and few are willing to make the first one. Whichever direction this breaks, the directional response of these lifespan metrics will provide valuable insight into the market bias. They will indicate whether old hands in particular are spending their illiquid coins and taking whatever exit liquidity is there, or if they are holding on like Rick Astley.\n\nBinary CDD Live Chart\nWeekly Feature: Seismic Mining Shift\n\nOne of the largest migrations of Bitcoin hash-power in history appears to be underway. Following an official ban on mining activities in a number of Chinese provinces, many miners are in the process of shutting down or migrating their hash-power outside of China's borders.\n\nOver the past two weeks, the estimated mean hash-rate (7DMA) has declined by around 16%, falling from approximately 155 EH/s to around 125 EH/s. Hash-power has now returned to levels that were sustained throughout mid 2020.\n\nMean Hash-rate Live Chart\n\nAs the Chinese mining industry comes to grips with the logistical challenges of relocating, migrating or selling their hardware and facilities, some are likely to liquidate a portion of their accumulated BTC treasuries. These coin sales may represent miners hedging risk, obtaining capital to facilitate and fund logistics, and for some miners, may be a general exit from the industry entirely.\n\nThe Miner net position change metric shows the 30-day rate of change of miner unspent supply. This shows a notable increase in distribution over the last two weeks, generally coincident with the decline in overall hash-rate. Miners have on net distributed at a rate of around 4k to 5k per month over the last two weeks. This has reversed the trend of net accumulation which was active since April.\n\nMiner Net Position Change Live Chart\n\nFinally, we take a look at the holdings on OTC desks which are utilised by miners for matching their large size distribution, with large volume buyers.\n\nDuring both the May Sell-off and over the last two weeks, between 3.0k and 3.5k BTC in net inflows have been observed. However in both instances, almost the full inflow size was absorbed by buyers over just a few weeks. On aggregate, the total BTC holdings on OTC desks we monitor have remained relatively flat since April.\n\nOTC Desk Holdings Live Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.\n\nNew Glassnode Content\nBitcoin's On-chain Market Cycles\n\nAs a truly free market, Bitcoin has shown to be an incredibly cyclical asset, both in investor sentiment, in on-chain activity, and investor spending behaviours.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 24, 2021)\n\nBitcoin becomes legal tender in El Salvador, whilst the market remains uncertain over macro direction. On-chain, Long and Short term investors are taking opposing sides of the trade.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJun 14, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nBitcoin has, once again, stepped into uncharted territory. This week, Bitcoin was officially voted in as legal tender in El Salvador, a truly historic moment for the industry. It also appears likely that the next major source of mining energy will be sourced from volcanoes. Was this on your 2021 bingo card?\n\nOur engineers just informed me that they dug a new well, that will provide approximately 95MW of 100% clean, 0 emissions geothermal energy from our volcanos 🌋\n\nStarting to design a full #Bitcoin mining hub around it.\n\nWhat you see coming out of the well is pure water vapor 🇸🇻 pic.twitter.com/SVph4BEW1L\n\n— Nayib Bukele 🇸🇻 (@nayibbukele) June 9, 2021\n\nThe week opened to relatively soft price performance, selling-off to a weekly low of $31,185. However, the market responded to the rapid passing of the bill in El Salvador with a rally back into the recent consolidation range, hitting an intra-day high of $39,269.\n\nAfter becoming a distinguished macro-economic asset in 2020, it appears Bitcoin is transitioning out of the 'gradually' and into the 'suddenly' phase. This week, we investigate the on-chain behaviour of both short-term traders and long-term hodlers to the weekly events.\n\nProfitable Supply Swings\n\nThe high volatility of Bitcoin markets makes it a magnet for traders, who are able to monetise price swings in both directions. Simultaneously, the powerful fundamental properties of Bitcoin make it a desirable store of value asset for long-term investors. During choppy and consolidating market structure, we can gain insight into the balance of supply and demand, and degree of accumulation by short and long-term holders, by observing changes in profitable supply during price swings.\n\nPrice rallied twice this week, first after El Salvador voted in the legal tender bill, and then again on Sunday afternoon. During both of these swings, the value held in profitable UTXOs jumped by around 1.5M BTC. Between both of these upswings, the weekly low of $31.7k to Sunday's high of $39.2k, a total of 1.985M BTC returned to an unrealised profit.\n\nWhilst some of these coins are likely to those purchased back in January (similar price range) and remain unspent, we can estimate that at least 1.985M BTC (~10.5% of circ. supply) has an on-chain cost basis between $31.7k and $39.2k.\n\nTotal Supply In Profit Live Chart\n\nWe can reasonably assume that this newly profitable supply is broadly held by three different cohorts:\n\nHODLers who purchased coins in early Jan 2021 and have not spent them. These coins are currently maturing across the 155-day Long-Term Holder (LTH) threshold.\nNew HODLers who are buying the dip in the current range and likely to hold throughout whatever volatility lies ahead (hard to isolate in the data for now).\nTraders and Short-Term Holders (STH) who are trading price swings and are more likely to liquidate at price targets or in downside volatility. They are also more likely to utilise derivative markets and leverage.\nTraders Take Profits and Short Positions\n\nLet's start with the last cohort, the Traders and STHs who are the most likely to generate overhead supply (sell pressure).\n\nThe chart below shows the amount of STH held supply in profit (green) and the STH-SOPR as a metric for the degree of profit taking (pink). There are two key observations here:\n\nFollowing each spike in STH profitable supply during price rallies (green 1, 2, 3, 4), the STH-SOPR spikes and holds an elevated level soon after (matching pink 1, 2, 3, 4). This indicates that some portion of this STH cohort are likely taking profits on swing trades or being shaken out by intra-day price volatility.\nDuring the price rally after the vote in El Salvador, around 737k BTC owned by STHs returned to profit (representing around 37% of the 1.985M from the last chart). As such, we can estimate that around 63% of coins with a cost basis in this price range are actually LTH owned coins purchased in January 2021, and 37% are recently accumulated.\nSTH Supply in Profit and STH-SOPR Live Chart\n\nStaying with analysis of short-term traders, we can see that futures open interest is climbing, albeit slowly, especially compared to Q1 2021. Total open interest has fluctuated between $10B and $12B for the last month and remains down around $8B (40%) from the previous peak in mid-May.\n\nFutures Open Interest Live Chart\n\nTrading volume on futures has been similarly muted, particularly relative to the $120B in volume that occurred during the capitulation event in May. Around $15B in additional volume was traded in the days immediately following the vote in El Salvador. Trading volume is starting to trail off again over the second half of this week.\n\nIt certainly appears that traders in derivatives markets are unsure about the macro market direction and thus keeping leverage levels and volume relatively low.\n\nFutures Volume Live Chart\n\nOn the perpetual futures funding rate, after turning extremely negative during the capitulation event, it has remained fairly neutral over the past month. Funding rates have oscillated between +0.005% and -0.010%.\n\nInterestingly, on the two aforementioned price rallies, funding rates turned negative indicating that a more bearish bias exists with traders preferring to sell into the rallies.\n\nFutures Funding Rates Live Chart\n\nHowever, it is often the case that large funding rates provide a contrarian indicator, as it suggests many leveraged traders are leaning in the same direction. Whilst the above negative rates are not particularly large, there has been an outsized volume of short liquidations on all three instances.\n\nEach time the funding rate (blue) has turned negative during the last months consolidation, price has rallied, and an increasing number of short positions are being liquidated (orange).\n\nFutures Funding and Short Liquidations Live Chart\nHODLers keep on HODLing\n\nLet's turn our attention now to the long-term holder (LTHs) cohort who include all buyers of coins prior to 10 January 2021. The LTH net position change shows the net monthly rate of coins maturing across the 155-day threshold, accounting for any coins spent.\n\nThe chart below is marked up with the price range from 155-days ago ($13k to $42k) mapped onto the accelerating rate of those coins maturing today. What this indicates is that a very large volume of coins were purchased in the early bull market, and have remained largely unspent. The current rate of maturation is over 400k BTC/month which is much larger than the ~160k BTC we estimated were sold, mostly by STHs, during the May capitulation event.\n\nLTH Net Position Change\n\nWe can also see this coin maturation in the Realised Cap HODL waves, which present the relative proportion of coin supply that makes up the Realised Cap. Not only are we seeing a decline in very young coins (<1-month old) due to the recent low on-chain volume, we are also seeing an expanding share of coins aged between 3-months and 12-months old. These are those same HODLed coins that were accumulated throughout the 2020 to Jan 2021 bull market.\n\nRealised Cap HODL Waves Live Chart\n\nSome LTHs have and will take profits on their coins. What is common in all Bitcoin cycles is that LTHs spend a larger majority of their coins into the strength of bull rallies, and slow their spending on pull-backs as conviction returns. This behaviour can be seen in the LTH-SOPR which tracks the aggregate profit multiple realised by LTHs.\n\nAfter peaking around 7.5x (LTHs realising 750% profits) in Mar-Apr, it can be seen that LTH's are realising declining profits during this price correction, even as price trades sideways. LTHs are currently realising profits with a multiple of 3.2x which suggests an aggregate cost basis of around $11.3k for their spent coins (7-day avg price $36.2k / 3.2 = $11.3k).\n\nLTH SOPR Live Chart\n\nA similar observation can be seen in the CDD-90 metric which plots the aggregate sum of coin-day destruction over the last 90-days. A decline in CDD-90 suggests that older coins (with large accumulated lifespans) are remaining unspent. This suggests that LTHs are not panic selling during this volatility and are therefore more likely to be re-accumulating than cashing out.\n\nCDD-90 Live Chart\n\nTo confirm this even further, we inspect the Binary CDD metric with a 7-day moving average applied. The base Binary CDD metric will return a 1 or a 0 when the volume of coin-days destroyed is greater, or less than the long term average. With a moving average, we can see when trends develop of old coins being spent (uptrend/high values), or remaining dormant (downtrend/low values).\n\nThe Binary CDD metric has reached an extremely low value throughout June, coincident with the early 2020 start of the bullish trend. This indicates that Long term holders are simply not spending their coins.\n\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.\n\nNew Glassnode Content\nBitcoin's On-chain Market Cycles\n\nAs a truly free market, Bitcoin has shown to be an incredibly cyclical asset, both in investor sentiment, in on-chain activity, and investor spending behaviours.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 23, 2021)\n\nThe market remains uncertain about bullish or bearish conditions govern, as on-chain activity and value settlement falls dramatically.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nJun 7, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has seen a relatively quiet week, both in price action, and in demand for on-chain transactions and value settlement. Prices have traded within a narrow range between a high of $39,242, and down to a weekly low of $34,942.\n\nMeanwhile, on-chain activity in active users, settled volume and transaction fees, across both the Bitcoin and Ethereum protocols, have fallen back to levels observed in 2020 and early 2021. Mempool congestion has largely cleared as the market remains uncertain around the bullish or bearish bias of the current market structure.\n\nCongestion Clears Completely\n\nA characteristic of bull markets is a strengthening demand for on-chain transactions, value settlement, and urgency for inclusion in an upcoming block. The net result is that activity, transaction volumes and priority fees spike higher. This is a result of both increased demand from investors, and the incentive for older hands to spend their coins into strength at higher prices. This week in particular, the growth in on-chain demand has slowed markedly, with a number of on-chain metrics showing significant pull-backs.\n\nSince January 2021, the number of active Bitcoin addresses has sustained a level around 1.15M addresses per day, coincident with the 2017 peak. It should be noted that in 2017, this level was reached for only a few days, before collapsing over 33% during the first sell-off. The present cycle sustained this high on-chain activity for 5-months.\n\nDuring the recent sell-off, the Bitcoin network experienced a reduction in active addresses, down 18% from the recent highs to around 0.94M. This fall is around half the reduction seen in 2017, indicating that whilst activity has slowed, more demand exists than after previous cycle macro tops (or perhaps there is further to go...).\n\nActive Addresses Live Chart\n\nThe number of active entities has similarly pulled back, retracing from a high of 375k to around 250k unique on-chain entities. This is again coincident with values observed in late-2017 to early 2018 as interest in the asset wanes with falling prices.\n\nThe key difference between 'entities' and 'addresses' is our use of clustering algorithms to establish when a single entity (such as an exchange, miner or a regular accumulator) may own multiple addresses, thus providing a more accurate view of unique 'users'.\n\nActive Entities Live Chart\n\nThe total USD denominated transfer volume settled by the Bitcoin network has pulled back by a whopping 65% in the last two weeks. Change-adjusted transfer volume fell from over $43B/day down to $15B/day. Again, the 2017 aftershock is the only event of comparable scale where on-chain settled volume fell by 80% over a period of around 3 months.\n\nChange Adjusted Transfer Volume (USD) Live Chart\n\nBitcoin is not alone in seeing this decline in on-chain activity. Ethereum USD denominated transfer volume dropped by over 60% in the last two weeks. The comparable decline in 2018 was far more extreme at -95%, however it remains to be seen whether this lull in demand is temporary, or a sign of things to come.\n\nEthereum transfer Volume Live Chart\n\nAs demand for on-chain transactions fall, the average transaction fee paid has similarly reduced for both networks. All time high mean transaction fees were reached in April and May, with short term spikes reaching over $60 for both protocols. Mean fees for both networks have now returned to mid-2020 levels of of around $3.50 to $4.50.\n\nBy almost all on-chain activity metrics, the recent month has been a historically large decline, transitioning rapidly from booming on-chain economies at ATH prices, to almost completely clear mempools and waning demand for transactions and settlement.\n\nBTC vs ETH Mean Transaction Fees (USD) Comparison Chart\nSupply Dynamics\n\nOver the last month, a total volume of 160.7k BTC has been spent from an illiquid state back into liquid circulation. This provides a gauge of the amount of overhead supply that has re-entered the market after being classified as illiquid by our analytics and heuristics (see more detail in this article).\n\nWhat is important to node is that this 160.7k BTC represents just 22% of the supply that moved the other direction, from liquid to illiquid, since March 2020. This means that of the 744k BTC that were withdrawn to cold storage (or equivalent) over the last 14-months, 78% of them have remained unspent despite this recent volatility.\n\nThe total number of addresses with a non-zero BTC balance has declined throughout May, dropping by a total of 1.2M addresses. Unlike transaction demand and other activity metrics, which fell 60%+, the decline in non-zero addresses (which are effectively spending all owned coins) has only declined by 3% from ATH. Compared to the 2017 peak, where we saw almost a quarter of addresses spend their coins, this is a relatively small net change.\n\nWhat it does suggest is that some portion of the market is spending their full balance from owned addresses suggesting a shift in conviction for that portion of the market.\n\nNon-zero Balance Address Live Chart\n\nWe can compare two versions of the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric to see that a majority of those spending their coins are a) realising losses and b) are spent by Short-Term Holders. Some initial points on SOPR to interpret the next chart:\n\nSOPR values indicate the magnitude of profit (>1.0) or loss (<1.0) realised by the market. Larger peaks/troughs mean larger profits/losses realised.\naSOPR variant considers the entire market. It does improve signal by filtering out relay transactions with a lifespan <1hr which are not economically meaningful.\nSTH-SOPR variant filters only for coins spent that are younger than 155-days capturing new entrants to the market, and filtering out long-term holders.\n\nThe chart below compares aSOPR (whole market minus relay transactions) to STH-SOPR (new market entrants only). What we can see is that both are below 1.0 and thus spenders are realising losses in aggregate across the whole market. However, note that the STH-SOPR is well below aSOPR. This indicates that the magnitude of losses realised by newer market entrants are much larger than the market on average. The aSOPR metric being close to 1.0 indicates that any long term holders who are realising a profits are more or less offset by short-term holders realising losses.\n\nCompare aSOPR to STH-SOPR Live Chart\n\nThe supply held by Long-term holders (LTHs) has started to accelerate upwards. The threshold for LTH status is UTXOs that are dormant for 155-days. As such, the next charts are largely describing investors who purchased between late 2020 and 3 January 2021, and have not spent their coins.\n\nAfter a period of LTHs distributing coins, as the market rallied from $10k to the $64k ATH, the net change in LTH supply is now in a firm uptrend (HODLing behaviour). Yet again, we can see this fractal is similar to the late 2017 bull and early 2018 bear. This fractal describes the inflection point where LTHs stop spending, start re-accumulating and hodling what are now considered cheap coins.\n\nLTH Position Change Live Chart\n\nLTHs now own 10.9M BTC which represents over 58% of the circulating supply. It is worth noting that LTHs today own 2.3M more BTC (+8% of circulating supply) compared to the LTHs at the 2017 peak.\n\nThis does highlight an intuitive reality; higher coin prices require larger capital inflows to sustain bull market trends. It also shows that the distribution of fewer coins can put in local/macro market tops if the capital inflow demand is not there.\n\nLTH Supply Live Chart\nDeFi Activity Slows On-chain\n\nThe slow down in on-chain activity is, naturally, not limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Aggregate on-chain activity such as transfer counts (top) and USD value transferred (bottom) for COMP, AAVE, UNI and YFI tokens has dropped significantly in the last month. These metrics are simple yet reasonably effective as a high level gauge for mass investor sentiment and can be seen to map reasonably well to trends in price.\n\nDeFi Metrics Live Dashboard\n\nFinally, we can see in the number of daily Uniswap trade transactions has fallen by 28% since peaking in mid-May suggesting a slowing of demand for tokens. The daily transaction count for Uniswap has returned to its long term baseline of around 160k trades/day which has held since September 2020 amidst 'DeFi Summer'.\n\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.\n\nNew Glassnode Content\nDeFi Uncovered: Experimental\n\nWe have released a new content series focused on insights and analysis pertaining to the rapidly expanding DeFi sector.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 22, 2021)\n\nThe Bitcoin market has become a battleground between bulls and bears, as we analyse on-chain sentiment for Long-term and Short-term holders.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nMay 31, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThis week the Bitcoin price has consolidated within a $9,430 trading range. Price opened the week at a low of $31,327, hit a local high of $40,757, before trading back towards the lows. A period of consolidation is to be expected as the market comes to terms with the dramatic sell-off last week.\n\nThe primary question on investors minds is whether a bear market trend is in play, or whether the market has returned to a re-accumulation range. In this newsletter we will assess the on-chain spending behaviour of Short- and Long-term coin holders to gauge their relative sentiment.\n\nApproaching the Pain Threshold\n\nThe current market structure is quite intriguing, as the Bitcoin price 5 months ago (our threshold for Long-term Holders, 155-days) is only slightly below current prices. As such, Long-Term Holders (LTHs) more or less represent all profitable coins (accumulated prior to 2021) with buyers from late December/early January at or near their cost basis. Conversely, Short-Term Holders (STHs) represent almost all coins that are at an unrealised loss.\n\nUsing statistical means, we established these two classes of coin-holders based on the time since a coin was last moved:\n\nShort-Term Holders (STH), generally assumed to be relatively new market entrants holding coins younger than 155-days.\nLong-Term Holders (LTH) generally assumed to be hodlers, smart money and buyers of last resort holding coins older than 155-days.\n\nUsing this classification, we establish the proportion of supply that is held by STH vs LTH and further by how many of those coins are currently in profit or at a loss. As the current trading price range is very close to the prices 155-days ago, we can also see that a small proportion of LTHs are now underwater shown in the light blue zone in the chart below.\n\nRelative LTH vs STH Profit and Loss Live Chart\n\nKey statistics regarding the current supply dynamics in the chart above:\n\nLTHs in profit (dark blue) hold 69% of all BTC supply. This essentially represents all buyers before 2021.\nLTHs in loss (light blue) hold 0.5% of all BTC supply capturing buyers from the final days of 2020 and early January. Should price continue to range in this zone for say 1-month (or fall lower), the thickness of this light blue zone will indicate how many buyers from January continue to HODL their coins.\nLTHs overall (white arrow) have returned to accumulation. This suggests that early bull market buyers (prices < $30k) have HODLed a reasonable volume of supply, and should this trend continue, may indicate a longer term supply squeeze is in play.\nSTHs in profit (dark red) hold only 4.5% of BTC supply, having fallen dramatically from over 30% in mid-April at the $64k ATH. This suggests that around 26% of the coin supply is currently underwater.\nSTHs at a loss (light red) therefore hold 26% of supply at an unrealised loss. This group are the most likely source of sell-side pressure now and into the future.\n\nIn our latest insights piece, we discuss the Net Unrealised Profit and Loss for both groups to establish their relative pain points. Our assessment is that STHs have capitulated a large volume of coins, however may continue to be a source of sell-side supply moving forwards. LTHs on the other hand remain largely in profit, however are approaching the NUPL threshold of 0.75. In previous cycles, this has signalled the start of more bearish trends as LTHs capture remaining unrealised gains.\n\nWeek On-chain Live Dashboard\nSpending Patterns Matter\n\nFrom the above, we can see plenty of Bitcoin investors are underwater and things may seem pretty grim.\n\nHowever, now that we have established potential pain points for the market, we can observe actual spending behaviours on-chain to verify whether investors are taking action on paper losses, or are being spooked by red candles.\n\nThe Average Spent Output Lifespan metric (ASOL) provides insight into the average age of all UTXOs spent that day. In the chart below, we have applied a 7-day EMA to emphasise recent spending behaviour whilst also smoothing out daily noise.\n\nHigh ASOL values mean old coins are on the move and distributing.\nLow ASOL values suggest old coins remain HODLed and dormant.\n\nThere are a two key observations related to recent price action:\n\nOlder coins saw a spike in spending behaviour in early May, likely in part distribution (smart money may have anticipated weakness) and also capital rotation (ETH doubled in price during this time).\nDuring the sell-off, ASOL fell dramatically, back to levels below the accumulation range seen between $50k and $60k. This indicates LTHs did not panic sell and capitulate and instead primarily HODLed through the dip.\nASOL Live Chart\n\nTwo more lifespan metrics, Coin-Days Destroyed and Dormancy tell a similar story. Older coins appear to remain dormant (low values) despite prices falling 50% from ATH.\n\nCDD represents the total lifespan spent by coins that day.\nDormancy corrects CDD for on-chain volume showing spent lifespan per unit BTC.\nHigh value are generally bearish as old coins are spent and distributed.\nLow values are generally bullish as old coins remain dormant and accumulation takes place.\nDormancy + CDD Live Chart\n\nAs seen in ASOL, the total amount of lifespan that is being spent has actually fallen at or below 2020 pre-bull market levels. This confirms that old coins are holding onto their stack, and the majority of spending is by holders of relatively young coins.\n\nWhat these three metrics indicate is that older hands are not rushing for the exit. If ASOL/CDD/Dormancy continue to trend lower, it would be similar to previous accumulation ranges as old coins remain dormant and weak hands sell to strong hands. Conversely, if these metrics begin to trend higher, it may indicate older coins are being spent once again creating further sell pressure.\n\nNote: We have recently released new video tutorials and Glassnode Academy entries for a number of metrics to aide analysts with interpretation. Video tutorials are available within Glassnode Studio for:\n\nASOL and MSOL\nCDD and Binary CDD\nDormancy\nLiveliness\nHODL Waves\nSo Who is Selling?\n\nSo far we have established that old coins are spending less than usual. However price is falling and exchange balances are climbing. So the question is, who is the dominant driver of selling?\n\nThe Liquid and Illiquid Supply metric shows that throughout May, a total of 155k BTC have transitioned from an Illiquid state (HODLed) to Liquid or Highly Liquid state providing an estimate of the total 'sell pressure'. This will account for both LTHs and STHs who spent coins previously held by to wallets with heuristics similar to cold storage.\n\nLiquid and Illiquid Supply Live Chart\n\nOn-chain settlement in USD terms is also very close to ATH this week with over $55 Billion settled per day. This is 60% more volume than the 2017 peak. It is thus undeniable that a huge volume of coins are on the move.\n\nChange Adjusted Volume Live Chart\n\nIf we review the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) filtered for Short-Term Holders, we can see that STHs continue to realise losses by spending coins accumulated higher, at current, lower prices. This metric will persist below 1.0 for long periods when there is widespread capitulation. With this in mind, current market structure is comparable with the March 2020 capitulation event.\n\nSTH-SOPR Live Chart\n\nWe can also review the amount of BTC transfer volume on-chain that is in profit (bought lower, LTHs) vs at a loss (bought higher, STHs). There are a number of key observations from the chart below which largely confirm the majority of spending and selling pressure is driven by short term holders:\n\nLong-Term holders clearly took profits during the early 2020 rally from $10k to $42k after which their spending reached a fairly stable baseline.\nLong-Term holder spending patterns appear unaffected by last weeks sell-off, and in fact the 'volatility' of spending volume has actually decreased. This indicates that LTHs are generally unwilling to liquidate coins at reduced prices.\nShort-Term holders on the other hand increased their spending by over 5x during this sell-off with the maximum spending occurring near the current local low of the market.\nBTC Transfer Volume in Profit or Loss Live Chart\n\nFinally, we can compare the supply held by three key parties: Short-Term Holders (blue), Long-term Holders (green) and Miners (orange).\n\nShort-Term holders are distributing.\nLong-Term holders are HODLing and accumulating.\nMiners are accumulating.\n\nWithout doubt, the current market structure is best described a battleground between the bulls and the bears with a clear trend forming between long term and short term investors. This is a battle of HODLer conviction and immediate buying power.\n\nLTH vs STH vs Miner Supply Live Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.\n\nNew Glassnode Content\nSurveying the May 2021 Sell-off\n\nLast week we released a deep dive analysis into the before and after of last weeks sell-off.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 21, 2021)\n\nThe Bitcoin market has experienced a tremendous deleveraging, with prices falling over 50%, and on-chain entities taking historical losses.\n\nCheckmate, Glassnode\nMay 24, 2021 • 8 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market has just experienced the largest deleveraging event since the March 2020 sell-off. The market traded down by over 47% from the weekly high of $59,463, to lows of $31,327. This weekly candle is now the single largest in total price range in history, a whopping $28,136 candle.\n\nPrice action was heavily driven by what can only be described as a FUD-bath, with topics pulled form every chapter in the Bitcoin critics textbook as @nlw summarises. This sell-off has been so severe that it has raised the question in many minds as to whether the 2021 Bull Market remains in play. This week we will review the scale of the correction and the response from various entities observable on-chain.\n\nA Capitulation for the History Books\n\nThe magnitude of realised losses on-chain this week has, eclipsed all previous capitulation events, including March 2020, Nov 2018 and the sell-off that ended the last bull market in Jan-Feb 2018.\n\nThe chart below presents the USD value of losses realised by spent coins and shows that a new ATH of $4.53B in losses was hit on 19-May. This is higher than the previous spikes in Mar 2020 and Feb/Apr 2021 by over 300% and is the peak from a total weekly realised loss of $14.2B.\n\nRealised Loss Live Chart\n\nAccounting for profitable coins that were spent, this capitulation event is still the largest net realised loss by a significant margin. Over $2.56B in net losses were taken on-chain on 19-May, a sum that is 185% larger than the March 2020 COVID sell-off. The chart below shows that this capitulation follows a strong period of net profit taking (green spikes) so could be considered an equal an opposite reaction to the downside.\n\nWhat this indicates is that a very large cross section of the market was taken by surprise by this event.\n\nNet Realised Profit/Loss\n\nThese net losses on-chain have resulted in a decline in the Realised Cap, as coins purchased higher are revalued to lower prices. The Realised Cap has declined by $7B (-1.8%) this week from its all time high of $377B.\n\nRealised Cap Live Chart\n\nLooking at the number of unique entities on-chain who are now in profit, we can see that the current FUD-bath has reduced profitable entities to 76%. This means that 24% of all on-chain entities are currently holding UTXOs that are underwater. In a bull market context, this compares to three periods in 2011, 2013 and 2016. This metric also highlights the proportion of the market who purchased coins higher and thus who may become panic sellers.\n\nEntities in Profit Live Chart\nAnalysis of the Sellers\n\nThere are three primary groups of entities that are likely to generate sell-side supply:\n\nCoin holders at a Loss who are largely buyers from the last 3-4months.\nCoin holders in Profit who may believe the macro top is in.\nMiners who need to sell to cover costs or are forced due to new Chinese regulations.\n\nThere is no question that a large portion of the recent spending activity was driven by short term holders, those owning coins purchased within the last 6-months. The spent output age bands shows that the 1m-3m and 3m-6m age brackets in particular spiked substantially higher than the typical baseline leading into, and during the sell-off.\n\nSpent Output Age Bands Live Chart\n\nIf we compare this to the equivalent spending by longer term investors, particularly those with coins 1y-3y old (last cycles buyers) we see the opposite picture. Holders of coins aged 1y-3y were actually spending their coins much earlier, likely rotating capital to capture the price out-performance of ETH at that time.\n\nDuring this capitulation sell-off however, the spending of 1y-3y old coins was actually significantly less and declining as a proportion of total activity. This suggests that old hands did not panic sell nor rush for the exits.\n\nHODLers Live Dashboard\n\nA major question that remains is what is the magnitude of unrealised losses, or in other words, how many underwater coins could still panic sell out? We inspect the Relative Unrealised Losses metric which presents the ratio between total underwater value and the current market cap.\n\nUsing this metric, we can see that around 9.0% to 9.5% of the current market cap ($700B) exists as unrealised losses, equal to around $65B in underwater value. Despite this being a historical capitulation event, relative to the market size, the value of underwater positions on-chain is actually relatively small. We can compare this to relative unrealised losses of 44% in March 2020 and over 114% in Nov 2018.\n\nNote that prior to a major sell-off, coins that were purchased higher have essentially 'stored value' at a higher market cap. After the sell-off, the new market cap is lower and thus it is possible to achieve > 100% relative unrealised losses.\n\nRelative Unrealised Losses Live Chart\n\nAcross the aggregate market, the Net Unrealised Profit and Loss metric has pulled back to just below 0.5 indicating that the market currently holds an aggregate of 50% of the Bitcoin market cap in profitable coins. This level has acted as a support in all three of the prior bull cycles and this is actually the first touch in the 2021 market.\n\nNUPL Live Chart\n\nIf we filter out for short term holders however, we can see that a major capitulation has occurred. Short term holders currently hold an aggregate unrealised loss of -33.8% of the Market Cap on their coins. This compares only to the most extreme draw-downs in Bitcoin history including:\n\nThe first Bull top in 2013\nThree events in the 2014-15 bear\nFour events in the 2018 bear\nMarch 2020 capitulation\nSTH-NUPL Live Chart\n\nOn the miner front, there are anecdotal indicators that miner sell pressure may increase in the short term as a result of changes to the mining industry in China.\n\nObserving the spending of miner coins demonstrates that whilst there is an uptick in miner-to-exchange flows, up from 100 BTC/day to 300BTC/day, this still represents a relatively small portion of the ~900BTC/day issuance.\n\nMiner to Exchange Flows Live Chart\n\nThe Miner Net Position Change metric confirms this is the case. We can see a slight decline in aggregate accumulation this week, however the rate of 'mined and held' coins remains a larger share relative to those that are 'mined and sold'. It remains to be seen if miners begin spending more of their coins as these changes roll out.\n\nMiner Net Position Change Live Chart\nExchanges and Derivatives\n\nFinally, we investigate the impact this week has had on exchange flows, balances and the leveraged derivatives markets.\n\nThere was a distinct increase in net deposits to exchanges, both in the weeks leading into, and during the sell-off. Peak net inflows spiked above +30k BTC/day on 17-May. At the same time, the magnitude of outflows has been increasing steadily the lower price falls, suggesting that there remain buyers of last resort even as the wider market capitulates.\n\nExchange Net-flows Live Chart\n\nAn interesting observation is that a bifurcation of the exchange market is underway in terms of which exchanges are increasing their BTC balances. The majority of exchanges have actually seen relatively flat to declining balances over the past weeks. Aside from a small increase during this weeks sell-off, these exchanges have effectively maintained an uninterrupted balance downtrend since March 2020.\n\nExchange Balances Live Chart\n\nThere are however three exchanges that have received almost all of the net inflows observed: Binance, Bittrex and Bitfinex. The balance on these three exchanges has been increasing throughout 2021, although Binance leads with the lions share of inflows. During this sell-off however, all three exchanges saw significant increases to their held BTC balance.\n\nGiven all three of these exchanges service clients outside the US, this may suggest a difference in response between markets in different jurisdictions. Another explanation is that Binance in particular hosts a large catalogue of trading markets, derivatives, and is the gateway to Binance Smart Chain, a preferred venue for recent retail speculation.\n\nFinally, on derivatives markets, open interest on Bitcoin futures has seen a tremendous decline from the ATH set in April. Open Interest across all futures markets has declined by over $16.4B (down 60%) from the peak and now returned to levels last seen in February 2021.\n\nFutures open Interest Live Chart\n\nOptions markets have seen a similar significant decline with total outstanding contracts down 52% from the peak to $6.4B, returning again to levels last seen in February.\n\nOverall, this flush of speculation and leverage is a healthy and necessary process, as it removes excessive speculation and forced sellers to allow more organic price action to return down the road.\n\nOptions Open Interest Live Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.\n\nNew Glassnode Content\nDeFi Uncovered: Farming with Stablecoins\n\nWe have released a new content series focused on insights and analysis pertaining to the rapidly expanding DeFi sector.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 20, 2021)\n\nAs Elon Musk reverses his Bitcoin sentiment, new entrants panic sell and long term holders step in to hold the line.\n\nGlassnode\nMay 17, 2021 • 7 min read\n\nBitcoin price has traded down over 26.1% this week as the market reacts to a series of tweets released by Elon Musk expressing concerns over the power consumption of Proof-of-Work mining. The market opened the week at high of $59,463 before trading down to $43,963 as the twitter saga unfolded.\n\nElon's tweets range from claims of negative externalities from energy consumption,  to claims that 10x faster and larger blocks on Dogecoin are a viable alternative. Unfortunately, this has lead to widespread confusion in markets, although for many Bitcoin HODLers, this is just another day in the office.\n\nOn-chain we can observe a notable bifurcation of reactions, with newer market entrants panic selling and realising losses, whilst long term hodlers appear relatively un-phased by the news. There are many supply and demand dynamics that resemble the 2017 macro top however with unique differences that will challenge the conviction of both bulls and bears.\n\nSizing up the Correction\n\nFirst up, we will assess the scale of this correction compared to the 2017 and 2021 Bull markets. The current correction is now over 28% below the $63.6k ATH set on 13-April. This is the deepest correction of the current bull market, however is consistent with five major pull-backs during the 2017 bull.\n\nIn terms of bull market duration, the 2021 primary bull (where new ATHs are set frequently) has run for around 200-days, which is relatively short compared to the year long bull run in 2017.\n\nDrawdown from ATH Live Chart\n\nThe number of entities that are currently in profit provides insight into the cross section of the market that is underwater. We can observe that this correction has lead to over 23% of on-chain entities (unique, separate wallets) being at a loss, which compares to only three up-trending periods since 2016. Note that all of these comparative pullbacks were associated relatively extreme events:\n\n2016 first pullback of the disbelief rally off the bottom, following 2yr bear market.\n2019 first pullback of the disbelief rally out of a 1.5yr bear market, driven mostly by leveraged short sellers getting squeezed.\n2020 Consolidation following global uncertainty after the 12-March COVID sell-off.\nPercent Entities in Profit Live Chart\nNew Entrants Panic Sell\n\nNewer market entrants have panic sold and realised significant loses on their coins, with both the aSOPR and STH-SOPR dipping below 1.0 once again. Both of these metrics consider the degree of profit realised by coins moving on-chain, with higher values indicating profitable coins were on the move, and values below 1.0 indicating most coins were last moved at higher prices.\n\nThe aSOPR metric considers the entire market, whilst also filtering out all coins with a lifespan less than 1hr (which are generally temporary hops and thus economically unimportant). The STH-SOPR filters for only coins younger than 155-days and is therefore representative of entities who bought coins during the current bull market cycle.\n\nBoth metrics have fallen below 1.0 indicating aggregate losses have been realised on-chain, an effect most pronounced in the STH-SOPR. This is the second major dip below 1.0 for STH-SOPR during this correction, suggesting widespread panic selling by new holders.\n\naSOPR and STH-SOPR Live Chart\n\nThe total count of addresses holding a non-zero BTC balance has also pulled back by -2.8% from the recent all time high of 38.7M addresses. A total of 1.1M addresses have spent all coins they held during this correction, again providing evidence that panic selling is currently underway.\n\nNon-Zero Addresses Live Chart\n\nIf we observe the cyclical pattern of total supply held by short term holders (STH), we can also see that a pattern of panic selling is playing out, similar to that observed at the 2017 macro peak. What this chart shows is that the Bitcoin market tends to find a local or macro peak at a time when new holders own a relatively large proportion of the total supply (i.e maximum coin supply held by newer weaker hands).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the current peak in STH owned coins is substantially lower than 2017 in both coin volume and as a percentage of circulating supply. New holder coins recently reached 28% of circulating supply (5.3M BTC) which is 9% less than at the 2017 top.\n\nGiven Bitcoin trades at much larger market valuation this may be a reflection of the larger capital inflows that are required to gain ground in market cap size. It may also provide an indication that this may be a larger time-frame pull-back in a bull cycle, as weak hands capitulate, and stronger hands recommence their accumulation of cheaper coins.\n\nSupply Held by Short Term Holders Live Chart\nExchange Flow Dynamics\n\nSupporting our observation of panic selling, aggregate exchange BTC inflows hit a significant high, with a net inflow of 27.5k BTC observed at the start of this latest leg down of the correction. This compares in scale only to the March 2020 sell-off and the distribution by the PlusToken ponzi scheme in 2019.\n\nAll exchanges Net Flows Live Chart\n\nHowever, if we break down this observation into the two largest exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, we can see two different realities.\n\nBinance largely captures non-US entities and is a preferred venue for retail speculators and investors and was the receiver for the lions share of this net inflow. It can also be seen that the magnitude of both inflows and outflows has increased over the past few months suggesting volatility in Binance user macro sentiment. This provides further indication that the recent inflows are likely to be driven by both new market entrants (panic sellers) and potentially due to capital rotation into other crypto-assets.\n\nBinance Net-flows Live Chart\n\nConversely, Coinbase has seen almost entirely net outflows of BTC since breaking last cycles $20k ATH, a trend that has continued this week. Coinbase is the preferred venue for US institutional accumulation, and given the scale of typical daily of withdrawals (10k to 20k BTC/day), it suggests that larger buyers remain in active accumulation during this correction.\n\nCoinbase Net-flows Live Chart\nLong Term Holders are Buying this Dip\n\nIn almost perfect opposition to new entrants panic selling, long term holders appear to be buying the dip and accumulating cheaper coins. Whilst the count of non-zero addresses has fallen during this correction, the number of addresses that are in accumulation have increased by 1.1% since the recent low. Accumulation addresses are defined as those which have at least two incoming transactions but have never spent any coins.\n\nAccumulation Addresses Live Chart\n\nSimilarly, the supply held by long term holders (LTH) has returned to accumulation mode, a pattern that again resembles the 2017 macro top. What this chart is largely reflective of are buyers who purchased coins in late 2020/Jan 2021 and have not spent their coins. As the supply of LTHs starts to rise, it indicates that the volume of coins maturing beyond 5 months of dormancy, exceeds the volume old coins that are spent to realise profits.\n\nThe current LTH owned supply is over 2.4M BTC (8% a proportion of circ. supply) more than it was at the 2017 peak. This indicates that a large volume of coins have moved to and remain in illiquid cold storage and this trend is continuing.\n\nLong-Term Holder Supply Live Chart\n\nOverall, the Bitcoin market is in a historically significant correction. There are strong signals that short term holders are leading with panic selling, however long term holders are stepping in to buy the dip and their confidence is largely unshaken. The PoW energy consumption narrative is nuanced to say the least, and what follows will be a test for the whole Bitcoin market's conviction.\n\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.\n\nNew Glassnode Content\nDeFi Uncovered: The State of DeFi\n\nWe have released a new content series focused on insights and analysis pertaining to the rapidly expanding DeFi sector.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 19, 2021)\n\nBitcoin consolidation continues as miners accumulate and supply on OTC desks drains. Meanwhile ETH benefits from capital rotation to new ATHs.\n\nGlassnode, Checkmate\nMay 10, 2021 • 7 min read\nBitcoin Market Overview\n\nBitcoin price continued to grind higher this week, rallying from lows of $53,333 to an intra-day high of $59,454. Price remains within the 'Trillion Dollar' consolidation range established since early February, as the market gets comfortable with a market cap sporting four commas.\n\nOn-chain signals continue to support strong HODLing demand from both miners and long term holders as overall spending patterns remain bullish. However there are also indications that a portion of BTC capital is rotating, with signals that ETH being a primary beneficiary.\n\nBitcoin Grinds Higher\n\nAfter falling below the $1 Trillion market cap level (~$53,475) during the recent correction, the Bitcoin market has bid the price back above a major on-chain support level. We can see this in the URPD metric, which is constructed to show the volume of supply transacted within various price zones.\n\nWe can consider these as price levels where BTC changed hands, creating a new cost basis for buyers, and levels where profit or loss was realised for sellers. The price zone above the $1 Trillion Threshold is the most significant on-chain support since $11k and the market is currently at the top end of this range.\n\nBTC volume equivalent to 12.1% of circulating supply (2.93M BTC) now forms on-chain support below the current price. A far smaller volume of 0.678M BTC (3.63% of supply) was moved above the current price which may form possible resistance.\n\nURPD Live Chart\nSupply held by Miners and OTC Desks\n\nMiners have returned to coin accumulation in a significant way throughout April and May, with the net change in miner balances going green. This metric is calculated by looking at the net change to miner balances over a trailing 30-day window.\n\nThis metric currently shows that miners are not only net accumulating, they are doing so at an increasing rate, suggesting strong conviction and bullish sentiment.\n\nMiner Net Position Change Live Chart\n\nIf we zoom out and apply a 14-day moving average (equal to the difficulty adjustment period), we can see that the current rate of miner accumulation is actually historically significant. The current net position change compares to only three instances in the last five years.\n\nAt a rate of 6,000 BTC accumulated per month (after the halving no less), this suggests miners are HODLing around 22% of the block subsidy issuance over the same period (900 BTC/day x 30-days = 27k BTC/mth).\n\nMiner Net Position Change Live Chart\n\nSince miners are often closely associated with OTC desks for distribution of mined coins, we can review the trend of OTC desk to estimate the balance of incoming demand from large buyers.\n\nThe total balance held by the three OTC desks we track has continued to decline throughout 2021, reaching local lows of only 6k BTC this week. This suggests demand by larger buyers exceeds available supply at these OTC desks. Furthermore, this trend clearly commenced starting in Dec 2020 at which time miners were distributing heavily. This aligns with the strong growth in institutional interest in the asset as a macro scale investment.\n\nOTC Desk Holdings Live Chart\nHODLing with a Hint of Capital Rotation\n\nThe current consolidation range has many on-chain similarities to the market during 2020 which was largely a period of accumulation. The Binary CDD metric (7-day moving average) shows the trend and spending behaviour of older coins, providing a proxy estimate for what the smart money are doing.\n\nA summary of the last ~12 months:\n\nJun-Oct 2020: Binary CDD traded sideways indicating older coins were generally dormant and accumulation was underway.\nOct-Dec 2020: Binary CDD trends higher indicating old coins were spent at an increasing rate to realise profits after the break above $20k ATH.\nJan-Mar 2021: Binary CDD trends lower as confidence and market conviction returns, and old coins slow down their spending.\nMar-May 2021: Binary CDD trades sideways again indicating that old coins are relatively dormant and the market has returned to HODLing and re-accumulation mode.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that Binary CDD is trading at a higher level to mid 2020 suggesting spending of old coins is still happening.\n\nBinary CDD Live Chart\n\nThe HODLed or lost coins metric tells a similar story, however it explains more about the current period. This metric measures the estimated supply that is either HODLed or lost and we can see:\n\nVery clear accumulation and balance growth in mid to late 2020,\nStrong spending in late 2020,\nA slow down in spending in early 2021.\n\nThese observations align well with the Binary CDD observations above.\n\nIn the current period however (March 2021 to today), this HODLed balance has traded sideways (not upwards as expected for accumulation), with short bursts of spending. Whilst this confirms older BTC are generally dormant and maintain bullish market confidence, the ongoing accumulation is being offset by a slightly larger distribution.\n\nHODLed or Lost Coins Live Chart\n\nIf we look the the BTC balance on the two largest exchanges, Coinbase and Binance, we get a strong hint as to where these spent BTC are heading.\n\nCoinbase balances continue to trend lower in a 'stair stepping pattern', indicating US institutional interest remains in play.\nBinance balances have continued to grow throughout 2021, and since early April, have actually started growing faster then Coinbase is depleting.\n\nGiven Binance is a preferred venue for retail speculation and has some of the most liquid altcoin markets, it is very likely that recent spending of BTC is indicative of capital rotation, as traders take advantage of altcoin volatility whilst Bitcoin prices consolidate.\n\nExchange Balances Live Chart\nETH the Beneficiary\n\nAs if it was not obvious already, ETH (...and DOGE) has been a primary recipient of a good portion of this capital rotation, with extraordinary price performance over the last three weeks. To demonstrate this effect, we can plot the spending behaviour of reasonably old Bitcoin UTXOs, between 6m and 3y, and compare it to the ETH price chart.\n\nWhilst this is only an empirical observation (correlation <> causation), the distinct increase in these older BTC being spent back into circulation after a prolonged period of holding makes a compelling case. ETH prices have almost doubled in this time from $2,200 to an ATH of $4,000.\n\nBTC Spent Output Ages and ETH Price Live Chart\n\nWe can see the relative magnitude of this capital rotation in the Spent Output Age bands where there is a noticeable uptick in old BTC spending behaviour starting in mid April as BTC price consolidates.\n\nBitcoin SOAB Live Chart\n\nActivity on the Ethereum chain has increased significantly over the past weeks, indicating on-chain economic flows support this rally in price. The chain has seen a strong uptick across the board of many metrics including total number of smart contract calls, uniswap transactions, total transaction rate and USD settled in ETH transfers, just to name a few.\n\nEthereum Metrics Live Dashboards\n\nFinally, the Ethereum chain has hit another on-chain ATH for daily transaction counts, as the increased gas limit provides a boost in maximum transaction throughput. A daily ATH of 1.63M transactions was achieved this week, representing a 22.5% increase over the previous peak, set just before the 2017 macro top.\n\nEthereum Transaction Count Live Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.\n\nNew Glassnode Content\nBitcoin's On-chain Market Cycles\n\nLast week we released our second collaboration article with Bitcoin Magazine with a focus on the cyclical spending patterns of Hodlers, Speculators and miners.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 18, 2021)\n\nBitcoin has bounced from the correction lows, as Tether supply hits ATH, coins mature and Ethereum on-chain activity spikes higher.\n\nCheckmate\nMay 3, 2021 • 7 min read\nMarket Overview\n\nBitcoin price has bounced from the correction lows this week, opening at $49,077 and trading up to a high of $58,396. The rise of stablecoins has continued with the largest stablecoin Tether minting a new ATH, with a weekly supply increase of $1.48 Billion. This reinforces the position and strong demand for crypto-native fiat.\n\nOn-chain data for both Bitcoin and Ethereum indicate strong conviction to hold both assets remains, as coin maturation becomes increasingly evident, and network activity trends higher. The Ethereum chain in particular has seen a notable boost in economic activity following the gas limit increase, as gas prices fall and transaction volumes increase in response.\n\nStablecoin Supply Mints New ATHs\n\nStablecoins have become a foundational asset and preferred base trading pair across the entire industry, providing globally accessible and crypto-native fiat rails. Demand for the largest and centrally issued stablecoin Tether (USDT) has minted a new supply all-time-highs this week.\n\nTether outstanding supply has increased by $1.48 Billion (+3%) this week to reach a total minted supply of over $51.78 Billion.\n\nUSDT Circulating Supply Live Chart\n\nRecent stablecoin inflows have pushed the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) down to a value of 13.4, which is approaching the all-time-low of 9.6. SSR has been persistently low during 2020 and 2021 as stablecoin supplies have grown proportional to the growth in Bitcoin valuation.\n\nLow and decreasing SSR values indicate that the global stablecoin supply is becoming larger relative to the Bitcoin market cap. As the total supply of stablecoins increase, it suggests an increased 'buying power' of crypto-native capital that can be quickly exchanged and traded into BTC and other crypto-assets.\n\nStablecoin Supply Ratio Live Chart\nConfirmation of Coin Maturation\n\nThe phenomena of Bitcoin maturation (the ageing of HODLed coins) has been discussed in prior weeks where we noted that coins older than 155-days are reclassified to be Long Term Holder (LTH) coins.\n\nNote: 155-days ago it was early November 2020, and price was rallying from $16k up to the $18k consolidation before breaking last cycles all-time-high.\n\nWe can observe these changes in coin proportions in various age brackets using the Realised Cap HODL waves. This metric will show colour bands increasing in thickness as coins mature or are spent into different age bands. We can see in the chart below that the proportion of coins maturing from 1-week to 6-months old has been growing since Nov-2020. These are coins accumulated in the early bull market that have remained dormant since (blue arrows).\n\nCurrently the age band for 3m-6m in particular is swelling suggesting many coins are approaching the 155-day Long Term Holder threshold indicating strong conviction to HODL.\n\nRealised Cap HODL Waves Live Chart\n\nWe can confirm this observation looking at the LTH Net Position Change metric which presents the volume of coins crossing the 155-day age threshold over the past month. Since 8-April more coins have been maturing than were spent, and this metric hit a 6-month high this week of 96.5k/BTC maturing/month.\n\nLTH Net Position Change Live Chart\n\nThe total BTC supply held by LTHs has also started trending higher after a period of net distribution and spending. This metric further reinforces that on aggregate, more coins are remaining dormant and HODLed by strong hands, than are being spent by LTHs to realise profits.\n\nLTH Total Supply Held Live Chart\n\nAs a final note on the recent Bitcoin correction and HODLer conviction, the number of UTXOs in profit dipped to 90% in the last correction, the lowest value of this bull market. This indicates that at the bottom of the correction at $47k, over 10% of all UTXOs were at a loss. This is coincident with most of the major corrections in the 2017 bull market.\n\nDespite this dip being the most significant in terms of overall coin supply being at a loss, Long Term Holders appear to be unshaken by the volatility.\n\nPercent UTXOs in Profit Live Chart\nEthereum Supply Dynamics\n\nOn the Ethereum chain, we can assess the age of ETH coins using similar tools like the HODL waves, whilst also taking into account nuanced differences as they relate to the Ethereum network.\n\nBitcoin has a primary application as store of value, making coin dormancy a reasonable proxy for measuring HODLer conviction. Ethereum however represents a far more active financial ecosystem, where long term holders may also deploy their HODLed coins in and out of smart contracts and applications. As such, ETH dormancy and age is only part of the equation.\n\nFirst we review the Ethereum HODL waves to observe dormant coin behaviour. We can see a very similar trend exists to Bitcoin whereby coins appear to be maturing from 1-week to over 6-months old since late 2020 (blue arrows). It can also be seen that the proportion of coins aged 1-month to 6-months are progressively increasing in thickness suggesting HODLing coins accumulated in the early bull market remains a favoured strategy.\n\nEthereum HODL Waves Live Chart\n\nAs noted, the use of ETH coins within the Ethereum ecosystem is a key to understanding the behaviour of the network. This week a relatively large volume of ETH was removed from known exchange wallets, spiking to over 200k ETH in a single day. The chart below demonstrates that in 2021, there have been 10 such occurrences with withdrawals of over 200k ETH/day. This compares to only two days with exchange inflows over 200k ETH per day indicating a general preference for self-custody of funds.\n\nETH Exchange Net Flow Live Chart\n\nNot only are ETH coins being withdrawn from centralised exchanges, they are undoubtedly finding their way into smart contracts and DeFi applications. The chart below compares the percent of total ETH supply held by exchanges (orange, 12.0%) compared to deposited in smart contracts (blue, 22.8%). The almost equal and opposite trend for these curves demonstrates a clear product market fit and demand for DeFi by ETH holders.\n\nExchange Balance vs Smart Contract Supply Live Chart\n\nFollowing the Ethereum miners increasing the block gas limit to 15M, the overall throughput of the Ethereum chain has reached a new all-time-high this week of 16.5 transactions per second. The prior all-time-high of 13.5 TPS was set at the peak of the 2017 bull run which has since been eclipsed for the majority of 2021.\n\nFinally we inspect the Ethereum NVT ratio, a metric that compares the network market cap to the USD value settled by the chain. Consider the following framework for interpretation of the NVT ratio:\n\nNVT Uptrends are more bearish, indicating transaction flows are getting smaller relative to market cap and the network may be over-valued.\nNVT Downtrends are more bullish, indicating transaction volumes are increasing relative to the market cap and the network may be under-valued.\nNVT Trading Sideways are supportive of the prevailing trend, indicating transaction volumes and market cap are growing equally and network may be fairly valued.\n\nThe chart below demonstrates an Ethereum NVT trending strongly downwards since Jan 2020, especially since the sell-off in March 2020. Recent high transaction throughput has also driven the NVT Ratio lower over the past few weeks suggesting support for the recent constructive price action.\n\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.\n\nNew Glassnode Content\nBitcoin's On-chain Market Cycles\n\nLast week we released our second collaboration article with Bitcoin Magazine with a focus on the cyclical spending patterns of Hodlers, Speculators and miners.

Despite weak price performance, on-chain data indicates old coins remain tightly held, miners have recommenced accumulation and the majority of transaction demand is coming from short term holders.\n\nBoth on-chain transaction volume and fees peaked to new all-time highs this week whilst the typical age of spent coins has fallen back to levels not seen since price was below $20k. Overall this suggests this correction has largely affected relatively newer entrants to the market and strong hands remain strong.\n\nOn-chain Activity Peaks\n\nThe Bitcoin network has been working through mempool congestion resulting from last weeks drop in hash-rate, coupled with increased demand for block-space during this price correction. This week, both on-chain transfer volume and average transaction fees hit new all time highs, eclipsing the peaks set in December 2017.\n\nNetwork congestion pushed the average USD denominated transaction fee to a new high of $54.40 this week.\n\nMean Transaction Fees Live Chart\n\nThe 7-day moving average of transfer volume (change adjusted) reached new highs of over $50.9 Billion settled on a daily basis, almost 25% higher than the previous ATH. The network has now consistently settled more than $10B in transfer volume per day for a 136-day  period, exceeding the peak duration observed in the 2017 bull market.\n\nChange Adjusted Transfer Volume Live Chart\n\nIn likely response to high on-chain fees, the number of daily active addresses declined by around 10% this week, from the typical range of 1.0M to 1.2M seen throughout this bull market to approximately 980k addresses.\n\nActive Addresses Live Chart\nNew Holders are Shaken Out\n\nInvestigating the Spent Output Age bands, we can  establish a view on the typical age brackets for coins spent this week. It can be seen that coins older than 1-month represent a very small and declining proportion of the total transaction flow. Conversely, the number of young coins (< 1-week old) being spent have seen an uptick towards the end of the week suggesting newer market entrants were shaken out during this correction.\n\nNotably, coins older than 6-months (purple colours) have not seen a meaningful increase in spending since the correction back in February. Previous instances of similar spending behaviour was observed during the December 2020 consolidation, just before breaking to new ATHs, and during the first bull market correction in January.\n\nSpent Output Age Bands Live Chart\n\nThe Short Term Holder SOPR metric has also fallen to the lowest value seen during this bull market. This indicates that coins spent this week were at an aggregate loss relative to prices when they last moved. This metric provides further evidence that short term holders who purchased coins at higher prices have been shaken out during this correction. Deep and lengthy retraces of the SOPR metric has historically been constructive for price in a bull market, as panic sellers are exhausted and coins are transferred to stronger hands.\n\nSTH-SOPR Live Chart\nOld Hands Hold Strong\n\nThe Average Spent Output Lifespan (ASOL) metric provides a view on the aggregate age of coins spent each day. This week, the average coin age has fallen back to between 25 and 30-days. These are levels that have not been seen since the early-bull market in 2020. This downtrend in ASOL has persisted since mid-January suggesting that old hands remain confident despite volatility and higher prices creating incentive to take profits.\n\nASOL Live Chart\n\nIn fact, if we analyse a number of lifespan metrics, we can see a consistent trend of old coins remaining largely dormant leading to downtrends across all metrics. The charts below present three different lifespan metrics telling this cohesive story:\n\nASOL represents the average age of all spent UTXOs (i.e. average age per transaction)\nDormancy represents the average age per unit of BTC moved (i.e. average age per 1 BTC)\nCDD represents the total volume of coin-days destroyed (i.e. global total of lifespan spent that day)\n\nAs all three metrics are breaking down this week, it means the aggregate age of coins spent are younger than prior weeks. This reinforces the case that old hands are not spending their coins and this correction has largely affected newer market entrants.\n\nBe sure to check out these metrics in the Week On-chain Newsletter dashboard.\n\nASOL (left), Dormancy (mid) and CDD (right) Live Dashboard\nMiners Resume Accumulation\n\nMiners have returned to accumulation mode with their net position change reaching highs not seen since mid-2018. This is even more impressive given coin issuance was higher prior to the halving event in 2020. This may also reflect market maturity and the increase in opportunities for miners to finance their operations without selling coins via collateralised loans and other debt instruments.\n\nMiner Net Position Change Live Chart\n\nThe total unspent miner supply also demonstrates how miners have returned to accumulation throughout March and April. Unspent supply is now over 1.8M BTC (note, this total includes Satoshi's unspent coins).\n\nUnspent Miner Balance (BTC) Live Chart\n\nIn USD terms, unspent miner supply is currently valued at $88 Billion after hitting an all time high of $112 Billion prior to this price correction.\n\nMiner Unspent Supply (USD) Live Chart\n\nFinally, as a result of high Bitcoin transaction fees over the past weeks, the Fee Ratio Multiple dropped to around 3.5 as fees made up an increasingly large share of the total block reward. A declining Fee Ratio Multiple is a positive signal for network security as it suggests that fees are gradually taking over a bigger role in the security budget. The Bitcoin Fee Ratio Multiple has persisted at values around 7 to 8 throughout this bull market indicating fees account for around 12% to 15% of the total block reward.\n\nFee Ratio Multiple Live Chart\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.\n\nWeekly Feature: Uniswap and Gas Fees\n\nTransaction fees on Ethereum have come down substantially this week after a sustained period of average gas fees well above 100 Gwei. The average gas fees are currently around 60 to 75 Gwei representing a welcome reduction of transaction costs for Ethereum users. The primary driver for reduced fees is the increased the gas limit from 12.5M to 15.0M by miners, effectively allowing more transactions per block.\n\nEthereum Mean Gas Fees Live Chart\n\nTraders on Uniswap have clearly welcomed these reduced gas fees as transaction counts spiked to a new all-time-high of 213k trades per day this week. This continues a steady uptrend that has been in play for much of 2021.\n\nUniswap Transaction Counts Live Chart\n\nUniswap trading volume has also continued trending higher this week, peaking above $1.8 Billion late last week. The reduced gas fees alongside correcting prices are clearly providing fresh opportunities for Uniswap traders.\n\nUniswap Volume Live Chart\nNew Glassnode Content\nBitcoin On-Chain Exchange Metrics: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly\n\nLast week we released a deep dive into our framework for tracking exchange balances and flows.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 16, 2021)\n\nBitcoin rallies to new ATHs before selling off by over 18%. This follows a slew of narratives around Coinbase, hash-rate black-outs and billions in liquidations.\n\nCheckmate\nApr 19, 2021 • 8 min read\nBitcoin Market Overview\n\nThe Bitcoin market ran into significant volatility this week, especially in comparison to the relatively calm consolidation in play since late February. This week, BTC price hit a new all-time-high of $64,717 in the lead-up to the much anticipated Coinbase direct listing. However this was short lived and was followed by a sell-off on Sunday with BTC trading down by more than -18% to a low of $52,829.\n\nThere was no market shortage of narratives attempting to explain this volatility, ranging from mismatched expectations vs reality around the Coinbase listing, a 40%+ drop in mining hash-rate, and billions of dollars in liquidations and flushed out leverage. This week we will assess the data behind these narratives as well as explore an accelerating trend of new and likely retail dominant entrants coming into the Bitcoin market.\n\nHash-rate Falls Significantly\n\nOne of the primary narratives circulating around Sunday's sell-off was a spooking of the market due to a precipitous drop in mining hash-rate (although the timing of Sunday's sell off is later than changes in hash-rate and thus is unlikely the primary driver). The hash-rate decline, started late on 15 April and is understood to be due to power outages and a coal mine accident in Xinjiang China, a major centre for the Bitcoin mining industry.\n\nMean block-intervals, which protocol difficulty targets to 600 seconds, began rising late on 15th, before peaking at over 1,300 seconds (21.6 mins) two days later. Hash-power has since started to recover with average block-intervals speeding back up to an average of 1,000 seconds (16.67 mins).\n\nMean Block-Interval Live Chart\n\nThe impact on estimated hash-rate was a drop from 203.37 EH/s down to 114.27 EH/s at the lows, representing around 43.8% of the estimated network hash-power going offline. Hash-rate has since recovered by 33% to 151.97 EH/s.\n\nIt is important to note that hash-rate is not explicitly known and must be estimated based on the currently mining difficulty and the observed block-intervals. Given there is natural variance between blocks, especially over short time periods (< 1wk), it is common for hash-rate estimates to vary between sources and over different timescales. Thus, block-intervals generally provide a more meaningful and accurate metric for tracking day-to-day mining market mechanics and hash-rate values should be considered within this context.\nHash-rate Live Chart\n\nUpdate 20-Apr: Further estimates from miners familiar with the incident in China have suggested that the net impact to global hash-rate was a fall of 20% to 25%, demonstrating the influence of natural block-interval variance on hash-rate estimations.\n\nDue to an incident in Xinjiang, China, Bitcoin’s Hashrate dropped by an estimated 20-25% from April 15-16th. What did we learn from this? How could this effect the future of Bitcoin? Here are some thoughts:\n\n— Mustafa Yilham (@MustafaYilham) April 19, 2021\nDerivatives Flush Out Excess Leverage\n\nAs is customary in the Bitcoin market, excessive leverage is flushed out during rapid price moves, and this week was no exception. As many traders increased their leverage exposure, likely in anticipation of the Coinbase direct listing, the risk of a long squeeze and cascading liquidations had built up in the system.\n\nOpen Interest across derivatives exchanges reached a new all-time-high of $27.4 Billion as price rallied to new highs. However, by Sunday afternoon, a total of $4.9 Billion in futures contracts had been closed out, with the majority of them occurring during the Sunday sell-off.\n\nFutures Open Interest Live Chart\n\nLong Liquidations across Binance, BitMEX and OKex peaked at $1.847 Billion, almost twice (+95%) the previous liquidation high set on 22 Feb. What is notable is how quickly Bitcoin market derivatives clear excessive leverage, with this entire liquidation event settling and clearing within a one hour window.\n\nFutures Long Liquidations Live Chart\n\nThe funding rate for perpetual swap contracts fell well into negative territory, hitting a new cycle low for this bull market at -0.017% (average is weighted by exchange open interest). Previous instances of futures funding rates resetting to zero, or going slightly negative, have indicated a significant flush of leverage has occurred, and is often constructive for price in the weeks that follow.\n\nFutures Funding Rates Live Chart\nOn-chain Sentiment Overview\n\nIn the on-chain space, the Short Term Holder (STH) SOPR metric has also reset, dipping below 1.0 by the most significant extent since the $29k dip in back January. This metric tracks the amount of profit (> 1.0) or loss (< 1.0) realised by coins spent on-chain, however it considers only new entrants to the market (those holding coins younger than 155-days).\n\nAs the STH-SOPR has reset to a value below 1.0, it suggests that some of these new coin holders were shaken out at a loss during this dip. However a low SOPR also signals that new holders who are in profit were not shaken out, indicating relative market strength.\n\nSimilar to the futures funding rate, resetting the SOPR metric has historically been constructive for price in bull markets.\n\nSTH-SOPR Live Chart\n\nLooking at older coins, we can see that both the CDD and Dormancy metrics ticked upwards slightly this week, however both remain within the relatively stable range established since mid-January. Both of these metrics track the age of spent coins and will increase when older coins are spent on-chain. This is a trend that is worth keeping an eye on as any strong continuation to the upside may indicate older coins are starting to take profits on a more significant basis.\n\nCDD and Dormancy Comparison Chart \n\nThe LTH-SOPR metric tells a similar story and shows that old coins have been realising profits during the consolidation throughout March and April. Intermittent spikes in LTH-SOPR indicate profits were realised by long term holders which can increase the liquid supply, as dormant coins are re-activated in to circulation.\n\nHowever during this weekend's sell-off, long term holders did not panic sell, and held onto their coins. The LTH-SOPR also reset back to relative lows, last seen around the $43k local bottom set back in late February.\n\nLTH-SOPR Live Chart\n\nA potential risk associated with this weeks sell-off is that price has undercut the $53.5k level which defines the $1 Trillion valuation mark.\n\nPrice did see a strong bounce to close well above this threshold at $56,163. This puts the market back inside a strong cluster of volume moved on-chain. So far, BTC volume equivalent to 14.32% of the circulating supply has moved at prices above $53.5k.\n\nPrevious editions of this newsletter discussed how this on-chain volume cluster is likely to provide strong support and help justify the $1 Trillion valuation (so far, this is the case). In this Trillion dollar support zone, 1.189M BTC has moved above $53.5k but below the current price of $57.0k (equivalent to 6.37% of circulating supply).\n\nHowever, this zone may also define the cost basis for a large portion of the market, and it is possible that some of these coins becomes overhead supply should market sentiment shift negative. A larger sum of 1.485M BTC has transacted above the current price (equivalent to 7.95% of circulating supply). As such, this volume profile, alongside metrics that follow older coin spending behaviour, are key on-chain indicators to keep an eye on as this market correction plays out.\n\nURPD Live Chart\nWeekly Feature: New Market Entrants\n\nThis week the trend of retail participation in the market has continued to accelerate with the growth in new entities on-chain continuing in a parabolic rise. We define the growth in net entities as the change in unique address clusters that are created (new UTXOs) vs destroyed (coins spent).\n\nPrior to November 2020 (before the rally back to last cycles $20k ATH), net entity growth was relatively stable, most likely describing regular 'sat stackers' and accumulators. Since then, we have seen a parabolic increase in new entrants appearing on-chain, with new highs set early this week.\n\nNet Entities Growth Live Chart\n\nIf we review the median size of new UTXOs created on-chain, we can assess the 'typical investment size' of newer entrants. We can see that during the late 2020 accumulation phase, the median UTXO value was around 1M sats (0.01 BTC), equivalent to between $90 and $120.\n\nAs both price and net entity growth expanded upwards, the median UTXO value has decreased to 300k to 400k sats (3x fewer sats) but has increased in fiat value to between $180 and $220 (2x more dollars). This demonstrates an approximate increase in BTC purchasing power of ~600% whilst the 'typical investment value' has doubled in fiat terms relative to late 2020.\n\nMedian UTXO size in BTC and dollars Live Chart\n\nFinally, retail lead speculation appears to be on the rise as is reflected in the recent out-performance of a large portion of the alt-coin market. One of the favoured trading venues for retail speculation is Binance which has seen the most significant BTC inflows of any major exchange.\n\nThe BTC balance held on Binance balance has been in a steady increase since price broke above $20k, but has accelerated in the last two weeks, suggesting increased retail speculation.\n\nWeek On-chain Dashboard\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has a live dashboard for all featured charts here.\n\nNew Glassnode Content\nOur Latest Newsletter: Uncharted\n\nCheck out out bi-weekly newsletter, Uncharted.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 15, 2021)\n\nBitcoin strong hands hold on, stablecoin supply expands, and cyclical metrics remain elevated but not overheated...yet\n\nCheckmate\nApr 12, 2021 • 7 min read\nBitcoin Market Overview\n\nThis week the Bitcoin market made another attempt at an ATH, with price rallying from a low of $55,664 to a weekly high of $61,235, just $448 off the peak set in mid-March. The market also saw growing excitement around the Coinbase direct listing, scheduled on April 14, as well as Grayscale's clarification around intent to convert the GBTC Trust into an EFT.\n\nOn-chain data continues to show resilience across many metrics with HODLed coins maturing to reach long term holder status, stablecoin supplies keep expanding, and cyclical metrics remain elevated but are not overheated...yet.\n\nRick Astley's Coins\n\nWilly Woo has expanded the Bitcoin market jargon with the introduction of the 'Rick Astley' buyer. These are strong hands who are never gonna give you up [read: hodling coins forever], nor let you down [read: never let their sat balance go down].\n\nThe Liquid position change metric Willy refers to indicates the rate at which coins are crossing the Liquid to Illiquid threshold. This metric considers coins in the last 30-days that either matured older than 155-days, or have been transferred into wallets where two or more coins have gone in, but have none have been spent.\n\nRick Astley loving this dip. He's the guy (marked in red) that buys and never sells.\n\nData: @glassnode pic.twitter.com/32PQzxCF6B\n\n— Willy Woo (@woonomic) April 7, 2021\n\nAnother powerful metric is the Bitcoin HODLer Position Change which presents the overall change in the global Rick Astley balance. This metric will be:\n\nRed and trend down when more old coins are spent than are maturing across the 155-day age threshold.\nGreen and trend up when more coins mature across the 155-day age threshold than old coins being spent.\n\n155-days ago was around mid November 2020, and BTC prices were trading up from $16k to $18k. This followed Microstrategy's initial two BTC acquisitions ($250m in Aug and $175m in Sept) and was around the time Coinbase exchange balances began to deplete (see our Week 13 Newsletter). This suggested that real institutional demand had arrived.\n\nAs a result, it is likely that the coins purchased by institutions in late 2020 and early 2021 are starting to mature past the 155-day threshold (assuming they held on in true Rick Astley style). As such, the HODLer Position Change metric is currently trending higher and if these institutional buyers did HODL, it is likely to continue in this trajectory over the coming months (keep in mind there will be a time lag between purchase and coins ending up in their final custody/cold storage arrangement).\n\nHODLer Position Change Live Chart\n\nA new metric available on Glassnode Studio is Coin Years Destroyed (CYD). This metric tracks the number of coin-days destroyed over the last 365 days. It provides a cyclical indicator to see if Rick Astley has been spending or HODLing over the last year.\n\nHigh / Uptrend in CYD means Rick has spent many old coins in the last year and may be letting you down.\nLow / Downtrend in CYD means Rick has been accumulating/HODLing in the last year and is never going to give you up.\n\nWhilst CYD is trending higher, it is notable that we are currently at a CYD level similar to the 2013 top, but are well below the 2017 top. Given the Bitcoin network is older, and coins in the supply have had more time to accumulate coin-days, if many HODLers were spending their coins, we would expect a relatively large CYD reading.\n\nThis suggests Rick Astley is still not ready to turn around and hurt you [read: in general, HODLers are still not spending their old coins].\n\nSupply Adjusted Coin Years Destroyed Live Chart\nBuyer and Seller Behaviour\n\nGlassnode recently collaborated with Ark Invest and David Puell to produce part 2 of the Analyzing Bitcoin's Fundamentals research paper. This provides a framework for analysis via on-chain data and tools for Bitcoin network performance and for the spending behaviour of its users.\n\nCheck out Part 2: Buyer and Seller Behavior: Analyzing Bitcoin’s Fundamentals\n\nRead Part 2: Buyer and Seller Behaviour\nStablecoin Supply Growth Continues\n\nThis market cycle has two significant structural changes relative to previous market cycles:\n\nExplosive growth in the availability of derivatives for speculation and hedging of risk.\nProliferation of stablecoins as both a reference trading currency and as DeFi collateral.\n\nGrowth in the three biggest stablecoins, USDT, USDC and BUSD, has been tremendous over the past 6 months reaching a combined market value of $60.25 Billion (these three represent 92.75% of the total stablecoin market).\n\nThe chart below presents the supply growth of these top stablecoins alongside the Bitcoin market cap, demonstrating a correlated growth in demand for both assets. USDT supply alone has increased by $3.36 Billion over the past two weeks even as BTC price has traded sideways.\n\nUSDT, USDC and BUSD Supply Live Chart\n\nAs more value flows into stablecoins, it creates more native 'digital dollars' that are readily transferable throughout cryptocurrency markets. This enhances market liquidity and depth and has created opportunities for both centralised exchange and DeFi products.\n\nThe Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) presents a ratio of the Bitcoin market cap to the total stablecoin supply. This metric can be used to estimate the global 'buying power' of stablecoins in the ecosystem.\n\nIf the price of Bitcoin is low, that [stablecoin] supply is able to buy a larger portion of the circulating BTC supply and therefore, push the price up — buying power is high [and SSR is Low].\nAs the price of BTC goes up, that supply of stablecoins is able to purchase less and less of the BTC on the market which reduces its ability to move the price upwards — buying power is low [and SSR is High].\n\nThe growth of stablecoin supplies throughout 2020-21 has held the SSR metric near historical lows suggesting a relatively high buying power of digitally native dollars. The demand for digital dollars appears to be keeping pace with demand for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole.\n\nStablecoin Supply Ratio Live Chart\nWeekly Feature: Cyclical Indicators\n\nBitcoin is known for its programmatic halving cycles, and despite each cycle having a unique market structure, often market tops have historically had similar characteristics. Many readers naturally be seeking out metrics that indicate when speculation gets so hot that paint is peeling off the walls.\n\nGlassnode has also recently released our 🚨Alerts Tool🚨 which allows you to set email and/or Telegram notifications for when specific values of our indicators are reached. This next section will present a handful of cyclical metrics and some key levels to watch and pair well with custom alerts.\n\nImportant Note: Remember, despite man-kinds greatest efforts, no metric can predict the future. Always consider metrics like the following within the context of the broader market and on-chain structure.\n\nReserve Risk\n\nReserve Risk is an oscillator that measures the cumulative 'opportunity cost' of coin holders deciding not to spend their coins. It will trend higher when price increases or when HODLers start spending their coins (realising profits).\n\nMarket tops have historically occurred at Reserve Risk values > 0.02 but often extend well beyond that with both 2013 reaching 65% higher for example.\n\nHeating Up: Reserve Risk > 0.02\n\nBoiling Over: Reserve Risk > 0.025\n\nReserve Risk Live Chart\nMVRV Z-Score\n\nThe standard MVRV Ratio takes the ratio of the Market cap to the Realised cap as an indicator of aggregate 'profit stored' within the on-chain network. The MVRV Z-Score then applies statistical normalisation to consider how many standard deviations the market cap is trading above or below the realised cap mean.\n\nMarket tops have historically occurred at MVRV Z-Score values > 7.0 however have consistently reached values greater than 11.0 in all previous cycles.\n\nHeating up: MVRV-Z > 7.0\n\nPaint isd P: MVRV-Z > 10.0\n\nMVRV Z-Score Live Chart\nNet Unrealised Profit and Loss (NUPL)\n\nThe NUPL metric takes the difference between the market cap and the realised cap and then divides by the market cap. This presents an estimate of the amount of profit or loss in the system as a multiple of the Market cap.\n\nIn other words, a NUPL value of +0.5 indicates that the total profit held by unspent coins is a value equal to 50% of the market cap.\n\nMarket tops have historically occurred at NUPL values > 0.75 suggesting aggregate unrealised profit in the system is greater 75% of the market cap.\n\nHeating Up: NUPL > 0.70\n\nOverheated: NUPL > 0.75\n\nNet Unrealised PnL Live Chart\n\nThe Week On-chain Newsletter now has its own Dashboard to help Glassnode users keep track of the metrics covered in each weeks analysis.\n\nWeek 15 On-chain Live Dashboard\nNew Glassnode Content\nOur Latest Newsletter: Uncharted\n\nCheck out out bi-weekly newsletter, Uncharted.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 14, 2021)\n\nBitcoin solidifies its position as a $1 Trillion asset as on-chain indicators signal market confidence.\n\nCheckmate\nApr 5, 2021 • 8 min read\nBitcoin Market Overview\n\nThe Bitcoin market has traded within a relatively narrow 5.4% range this week, between a low of $57,168 and a high of $60,265. Bitcoin has now reached the milestone of trading at a $1 Trillion market capitalisation for one whole week, a position that will hold for all prices above $53,566. This is a strong vote of confidence for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency asset class as a whole.\n\nOn-chain activity continues to reinforce this position with a volume equivalent to over 10% of circulating supply transacting above the $1 Trillion threshold. Meanwhile, miners have returned to accumulation mode and on-chain metrics have almost reset. Interestingly, futures open interest has hit new ATHs whilst both volume and short liquidations are in decline.\n\n$1 Trillion On-chain Support\n\nHaving now entered the 'twelve zeros club', the immediate question is whether the market can sustain these levels and what degree of price support we have below us.\n\nThe URPD metric shows on-chain transaction volume grouped into price clusters, forming an on-chain equivalent to the volume profile metric often deployed in technical analysis. Where a large volume of coins are transacted within a particular price band, it is likely to form a strong support (or resistance) level.\n\nAbove the $1 Trillion Threshold, over 1.98M BTC have been transacted, equivalent to 10.6% of the circulating supply. Impressively, this on-chain volume has formed one of the strongest on-chain support levels since prices were $11k to $12k.\n\nPeak volume in this cluster hit 297k BTC, transacted between $58.5k and $59.1k. The average volume of this cluster is 152k BTC which is also higher than the majority of clusters transacted at lower prices. It is likely that this volume cluster will form a very strong support level and appears to be justifying Bitcoin's 'twelve zeros club' status.\n\nURPD Live Chart\n\nTo support this observation, we review the total transaction volume denominated in USD over time. The chart below uses Glassnode's Entity Adjustment algorithm (EA) which is used to filter out transfers which are not considered economically meaningful (e.g. internal exchange transactions and self-transfers).\n\nThrough 2019 and into mid 2020, the Bitcoin network typically settled around $1.7B in EA volume per day. On-chain transaction volume has since risen, alongside price, by over 720%, now settling a typical $12.25B in EA value per day. This implies that despite the significant increase in coin price, there has been an an equivalent increase in transaction (and trade) volume to support and justify the bull market performance.\n\nEntity Adjusted Total Transfer Volume Live Chart\nOn-chain Sentiment\n\nLast week we showed how long term holders have slowed the spending of old coins in the last three months, a trend that has continued into this week. Additionally, Miners have now joined in, with the Miner net position change metric flashing green, indicating miners are holding onto newly mined coins.\n\nWhilst miners have an increasingly small influence as sell-side entities (when compared to daily trade volume), their spending patterns provide insight into the sentiment of some of the biggest bulls in the Bitcoin market.\n\nMiner net position change Live Chart\n\nThe Adjusted SOPR indicator provides us with insight into how much profit was realised by spent coins each day (whilst ignoring coins younger than 1hr). If profits are taken by old coins, aSOPR will trend higher and, conversely, it will trend lower when profitable coins remain dormant.\n\nThe higher the aSOPR metric is, the more profit has been taken off the table.\nWhen aSOPR falls below 1.0, it means spent coins were at an aggregate loss.\n\nIn bull markets, we typically see a 'reset' of aSOPR where it returns close to or below 1.0 during price corrections. This signals that profitable coins are staying dormant and confidence is returning to hold the asset.\n\nThe aSOPR chart below shows two key observations:\n\naSOPR has almost reset to 1.0 this week suggesting reduced profit taking and suggests confidence remains in the market.\nSuccessive peaks in aSOPR have reduced over the past three months. This suggests that fewer profits are being taken as the bull market carries on, again signifying a longer term trend of confidence in the market.\nAdjusted SOPR Live Chart\n\nFinally we review the wealth distribution between long-term holders (LTH) and short-term holders (STH) which is often a cyclical indicator of wealth transfer events.\n\nThis analysis points to some key observations:\n\nSTHs have accumulated around 440k more BTC than LTH's have spent over the past 6 months suggesting new demand coming into the market has exceeded LTH sell volume.\nThe relative wealth transfer is slowing down as shown in pink. This will occur as Long term holders slow their spending and coins accumulated in the last 6 months begin to mature.\nA similar wealth transfer occurred near the 2017 peak, making this an interesting metric to keep an eye on. This has potential to be both a supply constraint (bullish) but also suggests a cyclical change in holding behaviour (potential for volatility in either direction).\nA key difference to 2017 is that LTHs currently hold 66% of the circulating supply which is much higher than the 58% they held at the 2017 peak. This suggests that this cycle has increased 'HODL' demand compared to historical cycles. The flip-side to this is that there are more coins in profit that may become overhead supply in the future.\nLTH and STH Relative Holdings Live Chart\n\nOverall, the past few weeks have seen remarkable strength and demand to HODL coins in a bull market. This week has largely continued that trend with positive signs from both miners and long term holders whilst transaction volumes support the new Trillion dollar valuation.\n\nThe above analysis considers the spot market and on-chain flows. Since this is the first Bitcoin bull market with widespread access to derivatives, we will also look into the futures markets to assess overall performance of derivatives markets.\n\nFutures Cash and Carry Trade\n\nFutures open interest has hit yet another all-time-high of over $23.1B this week, with Binance and OKex representing the lions share with a combined total of 32% of all contracts.\n\nFutures Open Interest Live Chart\n\nInterestingly, futures volumes have been in steady decline throughout March with this week being particularly quiet relative to volume in previous months.\n\nFutures Traded Volume Live Chart\n\nPerpetual futures funding rates have also nearly reset to neutral levels suggesting a reduction in excessive long speculation and/or an increase in short interest to balance out long traders.\n\nFutures Funding Rates Live Chart\n\nShort seller liquidations have also been in decline over the last few months despite new all time highs in open interest. This suggests that short sellers either have exceptional risk management in a bull market, or more likely, many are deploying a risk neutral strategy in a 'cash and carry' trade.\n\nShort Liquidations Live Chart\n\nThe combination of high open interest, reducing futures volume, few short liquidations and reduced funding rates supports the case that the 'cash and carry' trade is a favoured strategy in current market conditions.\n\nCash and carry trades allow traders to combine long spot and short futures to lock in the prevailing funding rate/premium whilst remaining risk neutral for price volatility. As more traders take advantage of this arbitrage, open short interest will increase however without corresponding liquidations as traders are net neutral via spot holdings.\n\nWeekly Feature: Compound Token\n\nThis week, DeFi tokens have seen renewed interest reflected in both out-performing price appreciation and also in early signs of renewed growth in on-chain activity.\n\nCompound Protocol (COMP) in particular has seen a very strong week as the token price approaches the previous ATH set in early Feb 2021. This week, COMP has added an additional 2.3k new non-zero balance holders bringing the total to over 148k addresses, an increase of 1.5%. Over the same period the COMP token price has more than doubled from $227 to over $540.\n\nCOMP Non-zero Address Count Live Chart\n\nTransaction volumes for COMP have also seen a steady increase over the last two weeks after a lull in on-chain activity through early March. At present, 200k to 300k COMP are transacted daily which is approaching transaction volumes similar to early Feb when COMP was hitting its all-time-high price of $564.81.\n\nCOMP Transaction Volume Live Chart\n\nFinally, the balance held on exchanges has also risen alongside token price for the last two weeks. An additional 41.1k COMP have been deposited to exchanges this week representing an increase in exchange balance of around 20%.\n\nCOMP Exchange Balance Live Chart\nNew Glassnode Content\nOur Latest Newsletter: Uncharted\n\nCheck out out bi-weekly newsletter, Uncharted.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 13, 2021)\n\nBitcoin continues to trade above $50k as long term holders dramatically slow their spending, and a new class of HODLers are forged.\n\nCheckmate\nMar 29, 2021 • 8 min read\nBitcoin Market Overview\n\nBitcoin has traded down from a high of $58,328 to an intra-day low of $50,929. Despite this, long term holders have dramatically slowed their spending, HODLed coins are beginning to mature, and continued outflows from exchanges demonstrates accumulation is not slowing down.\n\nThis week we are seeing signals of coin maturation on-chain as coins moved into cold storage earlier in this bull market have now accumulated meaningful lifespans. Many are on their way to becoming classified as long-term holder (LTH) coins. These are the first signs of a new generation of HODLer, those who were forged in the dynamic market realities brought on in 2020 and 2021.\n\nForging New HODLers\n\nThis week we see continued growth in coins aged between 1m and 6m. These represent coins accumulated throughout the bull that are beginning to mature. Once a coin ages (HODLed) beyond 5-6 months, it is increasingly likely to remain dormant and is reclassified as a Long term holder (LTH) coin once lifespan exceeds 155-days. This makes the age bracket between 3m and 6m quite important when looking for strength and growth in new HODLers.\n\nSome price context since the Bitcoin market has moved exceptionally fast:\n\n6 months ago price was $10.8k (below $20k ATH).\n3 months ago price was $26.6k (before the first major pullback).\n1 month ago price was $47.7k (Bottom of second major pullback)\n\n(Side note: Can you believe that 6mths ago price was $10.8k!)\n\nThe HODL Waves chart below shows that the volume of coins with lifespan between 1m and 6m have swelled by over 9.51% of the supply, with a notable acceleration starting three months ago. Coins purchased between prices of $10.8k and $58.8k now represent 25.43% of the total supply with no sign of slowing down (HODL Waves trending up and to the right!).\n\nThis demonstrates a normalisation of buying the top and in fact, the overall shape of these combined HODL waves looks exactly like the price chart, just shifted 1 month to the right. The take home message here is that investors and traders have continued to buy in to BTC, throughout this bull market.\n\nHODL Waves Live Chart\n\nThe next chart shows the volume of coins maturing in/out of these two age brackets. Coins aged 1m-3m (accumulated in orange zone) have grown by +830k BTC, whilst coins aged 3m to 6m (accumulated in blue zone) have grown by +394.5k BTC.\n\n1m to 6m Active Supply Live Compare Chart\n\nOne of our most powerful metrics is the Illiquid Supply Change which shows the 30-day change in supply moving from a Liquid state (readily traded) into Illiquid state (HODLed coins). This can be due to both HODLers accumulating but also, importantly, coins maturing as their lifespan increases.\n\nGreen bars are Liquid coins moving to HODLed state (accumulation).\nRed bars are HODLed coins moving to Liquid state (distribution).\n\nThis chart looks at the monthly change, so we need to compare the bar chart (rate of change) to the price range in the preceding 30-days to see where periods where HODLer strength is increasing.\n\nWe can make the following observations regarding the supply vs demand balance over the past 6 months:\n\nAccumulation at rates exceeding +130k BTC/month have been consistently maintained throughout this bull market.\nHolders were nervous on the rally from $12k to $18k and distributed some coins (box #4).\nSignificant Volume of coins matured/HODLed (+207k BTC/m) as price broke above last cycles ATH as shown by large green bars in Box #3 (related to prices in Box #4).\nMaturing and HODLing of coins continues today with a rate of change hitting +195k BTC/m this week.\nIlliquid Supply Change Live Chart\nOld Hands Slow Their Spending\n\nAs if quantifiable accumulation wasn't enough, we also have old hands slowing their spending this week.\n\nMany on-chain metrics measure we use to HODLer strength use lifespan to quantify how long a coin has been held in wallets. As coins mature and get older, it indicates they are more likely to be held by stronger hands who are not shaken out by price volatility.\n\nCoin Days Destroyed (CDD) is a metric that:\n\nTrends higher when LTHs are distributing (many coin days destroyed, e.g. red zone).\nTrends lower when LTHs are HODLing (fewer coin days destroyed, e.g. green zone).\n\nThe CDD metric indicates that over the last three months, Old Hands have slowed their spending significantly. This week in particular, CDD has returned to levels similar to the early 2020 bull market baseline signalling HODLing is the preferred behaviour for old coins.\n\nCDD Live Chart\n\nWe can also see this behaviour in the Binary CDD metric which measures whether coin day destruction is greater than, or less than the long term average. Here we have applied a 7-day moving average that shows the last three months have indeed been trending below average, indicating LTHs are HODLing more and spending less.\n\nHint: Applying moving averages to Binary CDD helps spot trends and filter noise from the indicator. Check out our improved metric explanations in Glassnode Academy for details.\n\nBinary CDD Live Chart\n\nFinally, we take a look at Liveliness, a metric that looks at macro activity on-chain. It compares cumulative on-chain activity to the cumulative lifespan of the protocol. The most important observation related to Liveliness is the prevailing trend direction:\n\nDowntrend (green): More coin days accumulated than destroyed. This means HODLing behaviour dominates.\nSteep Uptrend (red): Significantly more coin days destroyed than accumulation. This means Old Hands are spending heavily.\nGentle Uptrend (orange): More coin days destroyed than accumulated. This means Old Hands are spending, but are not rushing for the exits.\nSideways (blue): Balanced accumulation and destruction suggesting HODLing is increasing, especially relative to the preceding uptrend.\nLiveliness Live Chart\n\nSince the first major dip from $42k to $29k, we have seen a notable slow down in LTH spending. This, alongside strong signals of accumulation show a supply vs. demand balance that is unlike any bull cycle we have seen before.\n\nAnd just when you thought supply dynamics weren't exciting enough already...let's deep dive into exchange balances.\n\nWeekly Feature: Exchange Balance Deep Dive\n\nIt is no secret that exchange balances have been in a consistent downtrend as more and more coins are accumulated and transferred into long term storage. Over the past 12 months alone, over 3.27% of the circulating BTC supply has migrated out of exchanges and into third part wallets.\n\nSome of these coins will be self-custodied by sat stackers, whilst others will be held on behalf of institutions by professional custodians.\n\nExchange Balance as Proportion of Supply Live Chart\n\nOver the past year, only two major exchanges have seen aggregate positive inflows (increased balances), Binance and Gemini. These two exchanges have attracted combined inflows of over 270k BTC, representing significant increases to their total balance. A significant portion of Gemini inflows will also correlate with Gemini's institutional custody solutions which further adds to the supply held in long term storage.\n\nExchange Balances (Stacked) Live Chart\n\nMeanwhile, the remaining major exchanges have seen combined outflows of over 616k BTC over the past year. Between Coinbase and Huobi alone, the combined outflow is around 400k BTC which completely offsets the positive inflows into Gemini and Binance.\n\nThis demonstrates the magnitude of the exchange balance draw-down that has occurred since March 2020.\n\nExchange Balances (Stacked) Live Chart\n\nOf particular interest is the balance of coins on Coinbase, a preferred venue for accumulation by US institutions. The chart below shows the BTC balance on Coinbase over the past year.\n\nWe can see that in December 2020, the game changed. As BTC price approached the previous cycle ATH at $20k and market confidence grew, serious institutional accumulation commenced. This started with 37.4k BTC withdrawn in December.\n\nIn the months that followed an incredible stair stepping 'whale cost averaging' pattern emerged, as tens of thousands of coins were accumulated each month. The consistency, frequency and size of this balance change is astounding to see play out in on-chain data and really shows the aggressive accumulation by institutions this year.\n\nExchange Balances (Stacked) Live Chart\n\nWatching supply and demand dynamics play out on-chain is a fascinating process. By combining coin lifespan, considering age brackets and spending behaviour alongside exchange balances, we can establish a model for the overall coin flow in across the network.\n\nIt is important to remember monitoring exchange inflows and outflows is a dynamic system with imperfect data. It is key to consider all such metrics as indicative and within a wider macro trend and context.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 12, 2021)\n\nBitcoin consolidates above $53.6k as on-chain metrics suggest conditions are similar to the second half or later stages of a bull market.\n\nCheckmate\nMar 22, 2021 • 7 min read\nBitcoin Market Overview\n\nThe Bitcoin market has continued to consolidate between $53.6k and $61.5k as announcements of further Bitcoin adoption come out from traditional finance giants Morgan Stanley and Visa. Morgan Stanley has launched access to three bitcoin investment vehicles, available their for high net worth clients and investment firms. Visa has also followed the Mastercard lead in the path to enabling bitcoin purchases via the Visa network.\n\nBitcoin becomes harder to ignore at an increasing rate.\n\n'Stacking Sats'\n\nSince March 2018, bitcoin addresses holding 1 BTC or less have continued to accumulate their share of the BTC supply. Three years ago, 'sat stackers' held 3.97% of the supply and have since accumulated an additional 1.23%. This brings their current ownership share up to 5.20% of all mined BTC.\n\nThe persistent accumulation of small holders demonstrates a willingness to HODL through volatility with the trend unbroken from mid 2018 through the chaos of 2020. We also see a large swelling of 0.1 to 1 BTC holders immediately following the March 2020 Black Thursday sell-off.\n\nDespite a small degree of spending in the rally up to $42k, 'sat stackers' are back at an all-time-high of holdings.\n\nRelative Address Supply Distribution Live Chart\nWhale Wallets Comparatively Flat\n\nInterestingly, whilst we have continued to see small holder accumulation, larger wallet holdings (>100BTC) are relatively flat on net over the past three years. The chart below shows supply held by addresses with 100 BTC or more. In total, this group currently hold 62.62% of the BTC supply and have increased their total stake by 0.87% over the past 12 months.\n\nRelative Address Supply Distribution Live Chart\n\nThese larger wallet balances have also shuffled around denominations, potentially as part of cold storage or custodian holding arrangements. Since approaching last cycle's $20k ATH in December 2020, we see approximately equal and opposite changes in larger holder balances:\n\nOctopus to Fish (10 to 100 BTC) have decreased holdings by -56k BTC\nDolphin to Shark (100 to 1k BTC) have increased holdings by +331k BTC\nWhale to Humpback (1k to 10k BTC) have decreased holdings by -307k BTC\nOn net across these cohorts, we have seen a slight decrease of -32k BTC representing only 0.24% of the total supply held by this cohort.\nMeanwhile our 'sat stackers' have accumulated +29.8k BTC in this same time demonstrating a gradual transfer of BTC wealth.\nSupply Held by Addresses Comparison Live Chart\n\nFor more information on our estimated Bitcoin supply distribution and holder categories, please see our blog post here.\n\nHODLer Cyclical Behaviour\n\nThe Reserve Risk metric is an advanced cyclical indicator which tracks the conviction of HODLers as we move through cycles. The general principles that underpin Reserve Risk are as follows:\n\nEvery coin that is not spent accumulates coin-days which measure how long it has been dormant. This is good tool for measuring the conviction of strong hand HODLers.\nAs price increases, the incentive to sell and realise these profits also increases. As a result, we typically see HODLers spending their coins as Bull Markets progress.\nStronger hands will resist the temptation to sell and this collective action builds up an 'opportunity cost'. Every day HODLers actively decide NOT to sell increases the cumulative unspent 'opportunity cost' (called the HODL bank).\nReserve Risk takes the ratio between the current price (incentive to sell) and this cumulative 'opportunity cost' (HODL bank). In other words, Reserve Risk compares the incentive to sell, to the strength of HODLers who have resisted the temptation.\n\nThe chart below presents the Reserve Risk oscillator which is currently at a value of 0.008 with previous periods higher than this highlighted blue. Past cycle tops have typically occurred at values greater than 0.02.\n\nAs price increases and/or more HODLers spend their coins, Reserve Risk will increase. This represents a BTC 'wealth transfer' from long-term holders to new buyers.\n\nFor more information on the Reserve Risk metric, be sure to check out the original paper by @hansthered and our notes on Glassnode Academy.\n\nReserve Risk Live Chart\nBitcoin Wealth Transfer\n\nWe can also look at the relative proportion of supply owned by Long-term Holders (LTH, Blue), Short-term Holders (STH, Red); and classify coins as in profit (dark colour) or at a loss (light colour) depending on when they were last moved. Note that the following charts present the proportion of circulating supply which are in profit or loss, not the magnitude of the PnL.\n\nBull markets generally follow a similar 'wealth transfer' path over three distinct phases. We can use these fractals to estimate where we are in this cycle as a companion to the Reserve Risk metric.\n\nPhase A - Max Pain: In the depths of the bear market, the maximum cross section of BTC holders are at a loss (thickest light colour areas). LTHs start accumulating (at immediate loss) around halfway into the bear as shown by the increasing light blue areas.\n\nAt the point of capitulation only 40% to 45% of LTH coins are in profit which represents maximum pain and has put the bottom in for all cycles so far.\n\nLong- and Short-Term Holder Supply in Profit/Loss Live Chart\n\nPhase B - Peak HODL: As the bull market progresses, higher prices create larger temptations for HODLers to spend coins. At some stage we hit 'Peak HODL', an inflection point where the largest proportion of LTH owned coins are in profit. Generally, this corresponds with breaking the previous cycle ATH.\n\nAfter Peak HODL we see profits taken at a faster rate than new HODLers coming in.\n\nWith each new cycle, we have seen more supply get locked up by LTHs. This is a reflection of both market strength, improved conviction, maturation of the asset class, available tools to access liquidity, and of course, exponential price increases and wealth generation.\n\n2011 Peak HODL = 55% of supply.\n2013 Peak HODL = 65% of supply (twice).\n2021 potential Peak HODL = 75% of supply.\nLong- and Short-Term Holder Supply in Profit/Loss Live Chart\n\nPhase C - Cycle Tops: Eventually, the market reaches a euphoric top which comes as more LTHs spend their coins following the Peak HODL inflection point. This represents a BTC 'wealth transfer' event from LTHs to newer speculators, and the re-activation of dormant supply back into liquid circulation.\n\nWe can estimate the proportion of supply that is spent by LTHs during this final leg of the bull market by taking the difference between Peak HODL, and the same metric measured at the blow-off top.\n\nThis may be viewed as the amount of re-activated supply needed to 'put the top in':\n\n2011 Top: LTHs re-activated ~12% of supply.\n2013 Tops: LTHs re-activated ~10% of supply for both peaks.\n2017 Top: LTHs re-activated ~17% of supply.\n2021 Current: LTHs have re-activated 9% of supply so far.\nLong- and Short-Term Holder Supply in Profit/Loss Live Chart\n\nSimilar to the Reserve Risk metric, these studies suggest conditions are similar to the second half or later stages of a bull market. There remains a larger relative portion of supply still held by LTHs having only spent 9% since the assumed Peak HODL point.\n\nThe 2017 peak had almost double the amount of spent supply (17%) before the 'top was put in', a reflection of massive new interest and increased audience. This BTC 'wealth transfer' is yet another interesting fractal to keep an eye on as Bitcoin exposure and adoption continues to grow and the debate of super-cycles continues.\n\nWeekly Feature: Ethereum Supply Dynamics\n\nAccumulation by smaller holders is not limited to Bitcoiners. Since March 2020, smaller Ethereum holders with balances < 10 ETH have accumulated an additional +1.41% of circulating supply. These Gwei Gatherers currently hold 4.58% of supply with trend continuing up and to the right.\n\nEthereum Relative Address Supply Distribution Live Chart\n\nWe are also seeing more long dormant ETH supply being spent in the HODL Waves. This chart shows that the volume of ETH supply older than 6 months has been in steady decline since May 2020. It is possible that along-side some profit taking, some supply may have been deployed into DeFi smart contracts or even the Ethereum 2.0 staking contract (noting large drop starting late 2020)\n\nEthereum HODL Waves Live Chart\n\nMeanwhile, the balance held in smart contracts officially flipped the balance on centralised exchanges in September 2020. As of today, exchange balances hold 12.94% of ETH whilst smart contracts now hold over one fifth of the supply at 21.11%. This demonstrates a clear product market fit as the trend started in 2020 'DeFi Summer' has continued to lock up ETH supply ever since.\n\nSmart Contract and Exchange Balance Comparison Chart\nCheck out Our Latest Newsletter: Uncharted\n\nWe have recently started a bi-weekly newsletter, Uncharted.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 11, 2021)\n\nBitcoin has a strong week as it rallies to a new all-time-high over $61k and long-term holders slow their spending.\n\nCheckmate\nMar 15, 2021 • 7 min read\nBitcoin Market Overview\n\nBitcoin has had a very strong week coming out of its second major bull market correction. Price opened at the weekly low of $48,918 and rallied to a new all time high of $61,683 over the weekend.\n\nDespite strong spot market performance, the Grayscale GBTC product has traded at a consistent discount this week closing on Friday at a discount of -7.1% to NAV. This reflects not only the influence of the correction but also the steady rise in new competition in the Bitcoin ETF-like space (e.g. the Purpose ETF). Meanwhile, MicroStrategy has announced the purchase of an additional 262 BTC for $15M as part of their relentless bitcoin accumulation strategy.\n\nGrayscale Premium Live Chart\nBitcoin Spending Behaviour\n\nAs bitcoin price performance continues to impress, it becomes increasingly important to assess how different market participants are reacting to elevated prices. In general, we make a distinction between Long Term Holders (LTH), those who own coins older than 155 days, and Short Term Holders (STH) owning coins younger than 155  days.\n\nWe base this off the observation that most liquid supply transacted daily consists of young coins that were last moved in the past few months. The chart below shows the age of spent outputs demonstrating that in most instances, more than 95% of spent outputs are younger than 3 months old (white space at the top are coins older that 3 months).\n\nConversely, once a coin passes our 155 day threshold to become a LTH held coin, it is increasingly unlikely to be spent on a statistical basis, often only coming back to life during volatility and at higher prices in bullish markets.\n\nFor more details on classification of STH and LTH, check out our research piece here.\n\nSpent Outputs Age Bands Live Chart\n\nWe often need to make assumptions regarding the different spending behaviours of LTHs vs. STHs to accurately interpret on-chain transaction data:\n\nLTH we assume are reasonably knowledgeable about the Bitcoin protocol and have high conviction in the asset. They tend to accumulate cheap coins in bear markets and realise profits on expensive coins in bull markets.\nSTH we assume are more likely to be newer market participants and traders moving value between exchanges. This group are thus more sensitive to price volatility and thus more likely to spend coins soon after their last transaction.\nAs bull markets carry on, LTHs will transfer some portion of their BTC wealth to STH whilst some STH will 'stack sats' and hodl their coins to eventually mature into LTHs.\n\nThe chart below shows the number of coins in profit held by each of these entities. Given BTC price is effectively at all time highs, this accounts for almost the entire supply (after filtering out exchange balances and other known entities).\n\nWe can see that since late November 2020 ($17.8k), LTHs have gradually sold around 1.4M BTC (blue, smooth downtrend) whilst STH have accumulated these coins and taken on the volatility (red, volatile uptrend). This is typical for bull markets.\n\nCompared to the 2016-17 cycle, both LTHs and STHs currently hold an equivalent volume of coins as they did around mid 2017. This cycle LTHs are actually coming from a higher base (hodling more coins) than in previous cycles, a result of increased coin issuance by miners, and a lengthy accumulation period through the bear since 2018.\n\nProfitable Supply Live Chart\n\nThis paints a picture where current STH demand remains strong and LTH are releasing coins gradually and at a slowing rate. However, it is important to keep in mind that LTHs also have a much larger supply still in hand which is both bullish for HODLed supply, but may also become overhead resistance as prices rise further or if a more sustained correction ensues.\n\nCycle Supply Dynamics\n\nIn terms of global supply, the HODL waves present a view on the proportion of supply that is held by UTXOs of different lifespans. As old coins are spent to realise profits, they convert from old to young, and their lifespan is reset to zero.\n\nThe HODL wave chart below presents the proportion of circulating supply that is younger than 6 months old. The height of these bands will increase as a larger proportion of old coins are spent (old --> young), and decrease as more coins are HODLed and mature (young --> old).\n\nFollowing all significant blow-off top peaks (including both pumps in 2013), the amount of circulating supply younger than 6 months continued to increase, peaking at 50% or more. In the current bull market, around 35.9% of circulating supply is younger than 6 months demonstrating that a substantial portion of coins remain firmly held by LTHs in comparison.\n\nHODL Waves Live Chart\n\nReturning to the Spent Output Age Bands (SOAB), this time we turn off all young coins and look only at the spending behaviour of LTH coins with lifespans older than 6 months. This chart shows us clusters where LTH increased their spending and are typically associated with bull market rallies or extreme volatility in bear markets.\n\nIf we look to the late 2017 bull market, there are three unique clusters of LTH spending:\n\nSell the Rally: Price rallies beyond previous ATH and LTHs begin realising profits into market strength. SOAB demonstrates an increase in spending as price rises out of major corrections (yellow).\nNew Paradigm!: The final blow-off top was actually characterised by reduced LTH spending compared to the previous two rallies, indicating a prevailing 'New Paradigm! This time it is different!' narrative (green). This sounds somewhat familiar.\nOuch...: Following the first bear market crash from $20k down to $6k, LTH spending hit an ATH as reality came back into perspective and profits were taken as price rallied to $10k, a 50% discount to the peak.\nSpent Output Age Bands Live Chart\n\nFor the 2020-21 bull market, the initial 'Sell the Rally' phase actually started comparatively earlier as price approached the previous $20k ATH. The second phase of similar spending behaviour occurred as price rallied to $42k before correcting to $29k in January.\n\nIn this most recent correction, dipping from $58k down to $43k and now up to a $61.3k ATH, LTH spending behaviour is actually reminiscent of the New Paradigm phase from 2017. We can see reducing sales over time and at a lower magnitude. In fact the LTH spending over this entire bull market is markedly less than the 2017 bull.\n\nSpending behaviour of LTHs certainly has similarities to that seen in the late stage bull market of 2017. However keep in mind that historical and new fractals must be contextualised within the market dynamics of the time. For example, a development which is unique to this cycle is the explosive growth in crypto-finance, lending services and derivatives markets for hedging risk (both centralised and decentralised formats).\n\nAlongside the major introduction of institutions to the market, it is very plausible that spending behaviour this cycle will have a unique character and fractals as holders find new ways to access liquidity and risk management tools without disposing of their coins.\n\nWeekly Feature: Miner Revenue hits ATH\n\nThis week, Bitcoin miner incomes have hit a new USD all time high of $52.3M per day. This is despite the block subsidy halving in May 2020. Since miner costs (CAPEX and OPEX) are generally denominated in fiat currency, this is positive for the assurance of continued security for the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nBitcoin Miner Revenue Compared Live Chart\n\nIn the post halving #3 era, aggregate miner income has typically been ~1,000 BTC/day, comprised of the block subsidy (~900 BTC/day) and transaction fees which have consistently fluctuated between 75 to 125 BTC/day.\n\nTotal Transaction Fee Live Chart\n\nOn-chain transaction fees paid in relation to exchange activity is also an interesting metric to track the movement and priorities of the market. At present, global transaction fees related to exchanges account for around 30% of on-chain transaction fees with deposits representing around half of that at 14.65%.\n\nNote also that most exchanges utilise transaction batching which makes for more efficient transaction costs. So whilst withdrawal transactions represent around 4.1% of the overall fee market, they are likely to account for many more individuals, especially when compared to the 14.65% of fees spent on deposits which are more likely to be one transaction = one user.\n\nExchange Fee Dominance Live Chart\nCheck out Our Latest Newsletter: Uncharted\n\nWe have recently started a bi-weekly newsletter, Uncharted.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 10, 2021)\n\nBitcoin continues it's consolidation around the $50k level this week, maintaining a strong composure despite volatility in traditional markets.\n\nCheckmate\nMar 8, 2021 • 10 min read\n\nThis week, volatility in the Bitcoin market has reduced as it consolidates in between a price high of $52,420 and a low of $46,561. Impressively, this Bitcoin consolidation has held the $45k on-chain support level Willy Woo identified in last weeks newsletter, despite weakness in both equities and precious metals markets.\n\nStrength in the US 10-year treasury yield has continued to put markets on edge with yields rallying +10.7%, closing the week at a 52-week high of 1.566%. The equities market showed weakness in response with the S&P500 and NASDAQ100 indices trading down 5% and 8% intra-day, respectively, and gold falling to a 38-week low of $1,730.\n\nPutting Bitcoin side by side with these macro assets, it is remarkable how resilient price action has been given the significance of such a rapid revaluation of treasury yields.\n\nOn-chain Support\n\nLast week Willy Woo noted that a significant volume of BTC was transacted on-chain around $45k, forming an on-chain support level. As we closed out the week, @n3ocortex highlights that this support level has actually strengthened to rest above $46.6k, with 1.2 million BTC (6.5% of circulating supply) transacting in this zone.\n\nWhen a large volume of coins move on-chain and an on-chain support level holds, it suggests that there is significant accumulation interest and buyers see it as a 'value' entry point. Keep in mind that despite on-chain support gaining strength since last week, should price fall below, it would become a level where overhead supply may form equally strong resistance.\n\nThis support is holding nicely.\n\nAnd it got stronger! We now have a wall of 1.2M $BTC that moved on-chain between $46.6k and $48.6k.\n\nThat's 6.5% (!) of the circulating supply.\n\nI'd be surprised if we go below anytime soon.\n\nI was long at <$50k, and am long now anyways.#Bitcoin https://t.co/eXcOhSmzbF pic.twitter.com/Gj3TFHVADW\n\n— Rafael Schultze-Kraft (@n3ocortex) March 7, 2021\n\nIn fact, if we look at the UTXO Realized Price Distribution, the on-chain support level at $47,173 is the largest since prices were $11k. Furthermore, the block of on-chain activity shown in green below, is not just a specific floor price, but instead a large support zone. We can see sustained and significant volume has transacted between $45.5k and $48.9k. This range now represents one of the largest on-chain BTC accumulation levels in history, certainly the largest since the last cycle's $20k ATH was breached.\n\nURPD Live Chart\n\nAn important question we must ask is whether this volume on-chain is associated with accumulation, or is it instead a rush for the exits by sellers. As a first step, we can observe that the BTC Balance on Exchanges continues its uninterrupted march downwards with another 35,200 BTC withdrawn this week.\n\nExchange Balances Live Chart\nMiner Positions\n\nMiners are extremely bullish Bitcoin network participant, having made huge CAPEX and OPEX investments in ASIC hardware and facilities. That said, they remain compulsory sellers of BTC to cover ongoing capital and operational costs.\n\nIf we investigate the Balance of Known Miners (filtered for miners that Glassnode has clusters for), we can see that up until early January 2021, miners were in accumulation mode. Miner distribution has occurred through 2021 however not to the same magnitude or rate as the preceding accumulation phase.\n\nKeep note that the miners shown below are only those we have identified and clustered (shown to provide a nice visualisation of this trend). There is another large pool of unknown miners ('other') that represent a significant portion of the mining market whom we will include in our investigation of the next chart.\n\nMiner Balances Live Chart\n\nThe Miner Position Change metric factors in all balances for all newly minted coins and thus provides us with a big picture view on the full mining landscape. What we observe is a peak in distribution behaviour throughout January (17k to 24k BTC/day) which can be largely assigned to a few larger unknown miners (and even a few early miners from 2010!).\n\nThroughout February however, we can see the rate of miner sales is declining, where today, it is almost net neutral. Despite newly minted coins representing only a fraction of daily trade volume (i.e. miner selling is small net force these days), it appears that even miners are returning to neutral or accumulation mode.\n\nMiner Net Position Change Live Chart\nLong-term Holder Positions\n\nLong-term holders (LTH) are classified as those who hold coins older than 155-days, and/or withdraw coins into wallets displaying characteristics of cold storage or long-term hodler heuristics.\n\nIn on-chain analysis, we must make assumptions around the behaviour and incentives of various network entities. With respect to LTHs, we generally make an assumption that they have good knowledge around Bitcoin and a high conviction. As such, their coins are often accumulated in bear markets, remain dormant for long periods of time and come back to life during bullish trends as they sell into strength.\n\nThe supply adjusted Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric excels at tracking this LTH behaviour. The longer a coin is dormant, the more 'coin-days' it accumulates. As more old coins are spent, more coin-days are destroyed and the CDD metric will trend higher.\n\nSupply Adjusted CDD Live Chart\n\nThe chart above shows that LTHs did indeed commence spending their coins in the period from October 2020 through to 8 January 2021 (CDD trending higher). However, since 8 January, LTHs have slowed this distribution behaviour. Both the 7-day and 30-day moving averages of CDD have returned to levels that are elevated, but not uncommon for early bull markets and even bear markets. This metric indicates that similar to miners, LTHs are taking profits, but are certainly not rushing for the exits.\n\nTo add further weight to this argument, we can look at the net balance of these LTHs. We see a near identical pattern to the miners where peak distribution occurred from late 2020 through to early Jan 2021 before dramatically slowing down. On net, LTHs are still distributing at a rate of around 44.5k BTC per day, however this represents less than ~5% of daily trading volume in futures markets and the trend is towards a reduction in spending.\n\nHodler Net Position Change Live Chart\nShort-Term Holder Positions\n\nFinally, we will investigate the behaviour of short-term holders (STH) who are classified as those owning relatively young coins (< 155-days old). STHs typically make up the majority of day-to-day traffic on-chain. In on-chain analysis, we often assume STHs are transient users, speculators and day-traders whom are more sensitive to price volatility.\n\nFirst we review the relative supply held by STH wallets that are in profit (young coins last moved at cheaper prices, green) and at those now at a loss (red). During the rally to the current ATH of $58.3k, there were over 5.12 million BTC held by STH that were in profit.\n\nAs this correction sold down to the $43.3k low, over 1.14 million of those BTC became underwater with an additional 0.112 million BTC being purchased early within the correction (and then falling underwater).\n\nThis suggests that there has been a transfer of around 112k coins from LTH to STH hands over the past two weeks and that 1.25 million BTC were accumulated by STH above $45k (which also lines up with @n3ocortex tweet and our URPD at the start of this post).\n\nSTH Profit and Loss Supply Live Chart\n\nWe can add weight these profit and loss dynamics by looking at the Spend Outputs Profit Ratio for STHs. This metric looks at how much profit was realised by all UTXOsclassed as STHs that were spend on that day. As a quick refresher for the SOPR metric:\n\nSOPR > 1.0 means on aggregate coins moved that day were in profit.\nSOPR = 1.0 means on aggregate there is no profit nor loss realised that day.\nSOPR < 1.0 means on aggregate coins moved that day were at a loss.\n\nLast week we saw that SOPR reset below 1.0 and we theorised this to be a first indicator of new retail level investors taking losses. This week we saw SOPR-STH retrace back to just above 1.0 despite sideways consolidating price action.\n\nThis second SOPR reset is healthy as it represents a retest of STH 'buy the dip' conviction. Previous instances of this SOPR retest after falling below 1.0 have generally signalled a calming of the correction downside, and in this bull cycle, have been followed by upwards price momentum.\n\nSTH SOPR Live Chart\nWeekly Bitcoin Market Summary\n\nThe on-chain analysis above is a typical workflow we use to assess the sentiment and behaviour of various network participants, within a set of behaviour assumptions. To maximise the value of on-chain insights, it is important to seek confluence between multiple metrics to improve our accuracy and probabilities of being correct.\n\nThis week, we have:\n\nSideways consolidation above strong on-chain support (that held last week), despite non-trivial macro market turbulence and weakness in traditional markets.\nOn-chain support at $45k has actually strengthened by over 1.2 million BTC changing hands, and even raised the support floor into the $46.6 to $47k range.\nMiners (who are uber bulls) slowed down selling behaviour after a few months of distribution. This total distribution was small relative to both daily BTC trading volume and miners accumulation through 2020.\nLong-term Holders (also strong bulls) have similarly slowed their distribution after a distributive start to 2021. Many of our lifespan metrics (e.g. CDD and ASOL) have dropped of significantly (meaning fewer old coins moving) and LTH balances are selling off at a reduced pace.\nShort-term Holders (assumed new investors/speculators) have taken losses last week, bought the dip, and had their dip buying conviction tested this week. More coins were transferred from LTH to STH however we did not see another SOPR print below 1.0 indicating we did not get more panic selling.\n\nOn-chain data suggests a relatively strong bull case for Bitcoin this week. The major risk that one must keep in mind is that the key on-chain support level between $45k and $47k falls, many of our observations may swap from strong support to heavy resistance.\n\nWeekly Feature: Litecoin Position Changes\n\nThis week we will apply similar analysis to Litecoin with a specific focus on HODLers of LTC. First we assess whether old LTC coins that are being spent or HODLed by investigating the Supply Adjusted Coin Days Destroyed (CDD). We can see that since October 2020, a relatively clear trend has emerged with CDD trending higher suggesting older coins are coming back to life and selling into market strength.\n\nLitecoin Supply Adjusted CDD Live Chart\n\nThe Litecoin Hodled or Lost Coins metric provides a view on the overall LTC supply that is deemed to be dormant, lost or in cold storage. Around October 2020, this metric peaked with just over 20M LTC fitting this classification (~30% of circulating supply). This was similar to the peaks achieved back in 2016 although at that time, 20M coins represented a larger share of circulating supply (40-45%).\n\nSince October 2020, coincident with CDD trending higher, we have seen 1.82M LTC spent by long term hodlers as market price has rallied from around $50 to the recent local high around $227. This suggests LTHs have taken profits into market strength.\n\nLitecoin Hodled or Lost Coins Live Chart\n\nFinally, we map this change in hodled supply into the Hodler Net Position Change metric, where we can see this trend stands out against the preceding 12 months. Whist hodlers previously accumulated at a rate of around 500k LTC/day through 2020, they are currently spending at a rate of around 660k LTC/day. This suggests that whilst profits are being taken in 2021, there remains a significant volume of LTC hodled held by long term user wallets (the accumulation period in green is longer than the distribution so far in red).\n\nLitecoin Hodler Net Position Change Live Chart\nCheck out Our Latest Newsletter: Uncharted\n\nWe have recently started a bi-weekly newsletter, Uncharted.

This week, we review how market and on-chain metrics have reset or are cooling off.\n\nCheckmate\nMar 1, 2021 • 7 min read\n\nThe Bitcoin market experiences it's second significant correction since breaking the $20k all-time-high. This week, we review how market and on-chain metrics have reset or are in the process of cooling off.\n\nBitcoin Market Overview\n\nThis week, the Bitcoin market has commenced it's second notable correction since breaking the $20k all-time-high. The week opened with a price high of $57,539 and before trending into an inta-day low of $43,343, representing a 25% correction.\n\nPrices across many markets have become volatile this week, driven largely by a rapid increase in the US 10-year Treasury note yield. Given Bitcoin's increasing adoption as an institutional grade macro asset, it is unsurprising that rapid changes in the time cost of money will influence Bitcoin pricing. Wider market narratives continue to evolve around expectations of inflation vs deflation and central bank policy responses. Bitcoin is likely to continue playing a key role in these discussions amongst institutions and investors.\n\nCorrection Resets Market Dynamics\n\nSignificant market corrections are positive events in that they flush out speculation, leverage, weak hands and test holder conviction. As the market seeks to set new price floor, we have seen numerous market indicators reset including futures open interest, futures funding rates and the Grayscale GBTC product.\n\nFutures open interest dropped almost $4 Billion from the peak of $18.4 Billion this week, a reduction of 21.7%.\n\nPerpetual futures funding rates have also reset close to zero. Previous combinations of decreasing open interest and a reset of funding rates have indicated a flush in speculative trading has occurred. This increases likelihood of spot market dynamics taking the wheel again. It is important to note however that open interest remains elevated, hovering around $2.50 Billion above the previous peak. There is still notable leverage within the market.\n\nThe Grayscale 'premium' has, for the first time, become a Grayscale 'discount', hitting a low of -3.77%. Whilst this price correction is a key driving force, the market is also starting to see the introduction of competitor ETF style products such as Canada's Purpose ETF (Glassnode dashboard available here).\n\nAs more institutional BTC products come to market, it is likely that Grayscale's product (and others) will not command as heavy of a premium in the future, as more options are made available for institutions to invest as close arbitrage gaps.\n\nOn-chain Metrics Cooling Off\n\nAlongside market dynamics, many on-chain metrics we track have reset or are in the process of cooling off during this correction.\n\nThe Adjusted Spent Outputs Profit Ratio (aSOPR) has reset below 1.0 for the first time this bull market, hitting a value of 0.988. The aSOPR metric looks at all coins spent that day and calculates the degree of profit or loss they were in compared to when they were last moved.\n\nWhen the aSOPR is less than 1.0, it means on aggregate, coins moved that day were at a loss. Low aSOPR values, especially when reset below 1.0, also mean fewer old and profitable coins were spent. This suggests confidence and HODLing strength remains for long term holders.\n\nThere is anecdotal and data driven evidence that the market has seen an influx of new retail investors. One example is the increased attention for exchange website logins and sign-ups discussed in our Uncharted Newsletter. As such, this relatively steep aSOPR reset may be our first on-chain indicator of 'panic selling' by new entrants. The previous dip from $42k never quite reset to 1.0 due to strong buy support (with a touch of Elon candle).\n\nIs this time different?\n\nAs a demonstration of how powerful this bull market has been, the Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) metric has not reset to it's typical bull market support value of 0.5 so far. Previous cycles have seen 'choppy' sideways action for NUPL as we move into the second half of the bull. NUPL value of 0.5 tends to act as a key buy the dip level where the market is in an aggregate profit of 50% of the market cap.\n\nWhilst both corrections this cycle have created the signature sideways and choppy behaviour, it seems buyers are stepping in sooner and fewer HODLers are letting go of their coins this cycle.\n\nWilly Woo demonstrates where potential on-chain price floors may exist using the Realized Price Distribution. This metric calculates the volume of coins transacted on-chain at various price levels. The aim is to find price levels where large volume was accumulated on-chain and thus more likely to be defended. Using this metric, Willy identifies the $45k zone as a potential support level.\n\nUTXO Realized Price Distribution. This is the on-chain, more precise version of volume profile. The peaks represent the price where most coins changed hands.\n\n$45k upwards is very strong support.\n\nAny dip (if you're are lucky) into $39k is a no-brainer BTFD.\n\nData: @glassnode pic.twitter.com/Z4xbEr0jTv\n\n— Willy Woo (@woonomic) February 27, 2021\n\nAs final evidence that perhaps 'this time is different', the sustained trend and volume of coins being withdrawn into illiquid status continues. The most important observation is the date at which this trend commenced: 12 March 2020.\n\nThe trend of coins being withdrawn and locked away into long term holding patterns provides strong evidence that Bitcoin is now viewed as an important macro asset. Whilst on-chain metrics are resetting, and one can argue there is room to go in this correction, there still appears to be significant demand from long-term investors. This is quite unique in both trend and scale compared to Bitcoin's history, especially at this stage in a bull market.\n\nOf course, the risk remains that 'this time is not different' and perhaps NUPL does in fact reset to 0.5. In this instance, with the Realised Price trading at $14,511, this means a 50% profit level would correspond to a price floor of 2.0*14,511 = $29,022. Quite the drop!\n\nWeekly Feature: Liquidity on Uniswap\n\nLast week we covered the prevailing fee environment on Ethereum, noting that it is both a vote of confidence for the chain, as well as a constraint for users of the protocol. Over the past week, Ethereum network fees have been somewhat lower than in recent months and we have seen a slight tremor in transaction volume and liquidity interacting with Uniswap. Perhaps users taking advantage of lower fees to reshuffle their assets.\n\nThis week $1.04 Billion in liquidity was withdrawn from Uniswap which appears to be spread across an variety of assets. Uniswap transaction counts fell significantly from ~186k to 85k tx/day on 18-Feb, approximately signalling the local top in ETH/USD price. Uniswap transaction volume then surged to $1.76 Billion on 23-Feb before dropping 45% to $0.97 Billion by weeks end.\n\nA Glassnode Uniswap dashboard is available here.\n\nLiquidity withdrawals from Uniswap can be seen across four major DeFi assets as examples: YFI, UNI, SUSHI and AAVE all saw liquidity reserves fall by around 20% to 30% this week.\n\nIt must be noted that most Uniswap liquidity and volume values are coming off near all-time-highs so it remains to be seen if these are simply a response to the price correction, or the start of a trend or asset rotation.\n\nCheck out Our Latest Newsletter: Uncharted\n\nWe have recently started a bi-weekly newsletter, Uncharted.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-chain (Week 8, 2021)\n\nBitcoin hits new all time highs alongside news of MicroStrategy completing yet another convertible note issuance for a total of $1.05 Billion.\n\nCheckmate\nFeb 22, 2021 • 6 min read\nBitcoin Market Overview\n\nBitcoin has continued it's trend of new all time highs which is almost becoming a daily occurrence in 2021. The market opened up the week with an intra-day low of $46,347 before rallying to an all time high of $58,330 on Sunday.\n\nA fundamental factor driving continued market strength is likely news of MicroStrategy completing yet another convertible note issuance for a total of $1.05 Billion. These funds are to be used for the explicit purpose of acquiring additional BTC for the company balance sheet. Without question, corporate balance sheet acquisition of BTC has been the trend for 2020-21 and MicroStrategy is at the tip of the spear.\n\nLarger Wallets Shuffling Supply\n\nAs price continues to appreciate, there are some signs of shifts occurring in the larger wallets (100+ BTC) that may provide some insight into underlying market dynamics. It is key to understand the holistic picture before making an assumption as to whether these coins are buying, selling or holding and on-chain data is well placed to provide this insight.\n\nWallets with 1k to 10k BTC holdings in particular have been in a strong uptrend since March 2020, having increased by 14.18% between 12-Mar-20 and 5-Feb-21. This has been referred to as 'Bitcoin whale spawning season' as these addresses represent holdings of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars (considering price rallying from $3.8k to $58k in that time).\n\nHowever over the last two weeks, this wallet class appears to be 'reducing holdings'. Is this new sell pressure? Are institutions getting spooked or taking profits? A few interesting occurrences on-chain are presented in the points, table and charts below to help answer this question.\n\nOctopus to Fish (10 to 100 BTC, red) have been in a persistent down-trend since November 2020 declining by around -128k BTC. This trend is largely uninterrupted.\nDolphin to Shark (100 to 1k BTC, purple) have been gradually accumulating through 2020, with a notable decline of around -95k BTC in January 2021. In February however, these wallets have seen a growth of +117k BTC to new local highs.\nWhale to Humpback (1k to 10k BTC, green) have similarly been in accumulation throughout 2020. However, 2021 has been almost perfect inverse to the Dolphin/Shark class. Whales saw a supply increase in January of around +80k BTC and a subsequent decrease in supply of -140k BTC in February.\n\nImportant to note is how the supply changes for the Dolphin/Shark class (purple) and Whale/Humpback class (green) are mirrored in volume and shape. Where one class sees increasing volume, the other sees decreasing volume (and vice-versa). Large vertical changes in charts like this are often characteristic of a few large entities (e.g. exchanges, whales or miners) making internal transactions.\n\nThis wallet behaviour suggests a sizeable portion of these coins may not be sold, but instead being restructured in custodial wallets. There was a preference for 1k to 10k wallets in January (acquisition withdrawals perhaps) that are now transitioning into larger sets of UTXOs with smaller denominations between 100 and 1k. Perhaps coins are being placed into multi-signature schemes or custodians are undertaking internal shuffling to meet client requirements.\n\nWe can add additional weight to this thesis by observing the balance held by accumulation addresses that remains in a consistent up-trend. Accumulation wallets are those displaying long term HODLer heuristics with at least two incoming transfers and no spends (the metric ignores exchanges, miners and ancient coins > 7yrs).\n\nIn fact, once could hazard a guess that this behaviour is indicative of very long term custodial holdings and coins are entering deep cold storage. So whilst coins are on the move and larger balances are being reclassified, it does not necessarily suggest an end to whale spawning season (and may in fact suggest the opposite!).\n\nEthereum Feature: Mining Revenues\n\nIt is no secret that Ethereum fees have been on the rise. Ultimately, this can be considered a vote of confidence that users are willing to pay a premium for inclusion in a block. Users will pay a high fee so long as the value of the transaction is outcome is profitable relative to the fee paid.\n\nImpressively, Ethereum transaction fees have managed to sustain over 50% share of the total block reward on two major occasions, during 'DeFi summer' between August and October 2020, and throughout most of 2021.\n\nA 50% fee revenue means that transaction fees are currently equal to the available block subsidy making mining on Ethereum significantly more profitable. Current mining revenues are fluctuating around 25k to 30k ETH per day (purple) which creates an incentive for miners to bring more hash-power (orange) onto the network to create a secure barrier of energy and hardware. On the 19-Feb, Ethereum hash-rate hit a new all time high of 431.7 TH/s, almost 60% higher than the previous market cycle peak of 292.1TH/s in July 2018.\n\nWhilst high fees and congestion can be challenging for Ethereum users, it does signify greatly enhanced protocol security and product market fit. This demonstrates a demand case for decentralised finance applications which are driving much of the demand for block-space. The challenge of congestion and fee pressure will also act as motivation to expand focus and efforts of scalability technology to improve user experience.\n\nWeekly Feature: Grayscale Dashboards\n\nGlassnode has recently implemented metrics to track Grayscale inflows and balances for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. This institutional supply sink continues to absorb coins from the market and over the past week, Grayscale products have taken in a total supply of 1,640 BTC (~$95M) and 27,480 ETH (~$53M).\n\nThe GBTC product has continued to trade at a premium between +8.5% and +12.2% this week suggesting continued institutional interest. Where a premium is present for Grayscale products, an arbitrage trade opportunity exists for in-kind transfers of BTC into the trust creating a persistent supply sink. A similar premium is present for the GETH product this week trading between +5.1% and +11.2% compared to net asset value.\n\nA preset Grayscale dashboard is available to inspect asset flows, balances under management and price premiums. Be sure to check out Glassnode dashboards to use the preset dashboards, or to build your own custom suite of metrics to track this evolving market.\n\nSpecial Offer: Free Month of Glassnode Advanced\n\nWe've partnered with ZUBR to offer a free month of Glassnode Advanced to users who sign up and trade crypto perpetuals on their platform.\n\nZUBR is a derivatives exchange built by HFT-traders, featuring guaranteed microsecond execution of trades with only 0.01% trading fees.

This newsletter covers BTC from both an on-chain and off-chain data perspective, and uses beautiful charts and brief commentaries to give readers an intuitive snapshot of what is happening in the markets.\n\nCheck out Uncharted on our Substack, and subscribe now!\n\nBitcoin Market Overview\n\nThis week, the Bitcoin market opened up to the significant news of Elon Musk's firm Tesla, purchasing $1.5 Billion worth of BTC as part of the companies balance sheet strategy. Immediately following the news, BTC/USD printed the largest daily candle in history, up a staggering $7,162 (+18.45% on the day). The market has lovingly named this the 'Elon Candle'.\n\nThe market held onto these gains, and has since rallied to new all time highs of $49,485 after tagging an intra-day low of $43,909 along the way. There is no doubt, 2021 continues to shape up as a very exciting year for Bitcoin.\n\nMarket Reaction to the 'Elon Candle'\n\nThe balance of BTC held in exchange wallets has now been in a remarkable downtrend for over 12 months. The all time high for exchange balances occurred on 11-Feb-2020 (3.016M BTC) after which a total of 666.8k BTC have been withdrawn. This represents a 22% draw-down in exchange held coins leaving just over 2.346M BTC on exchanges.\n\nThis week, exchange balances have remained relatively flat seeing only a slight inflow of 3,000 BTC.\n\nMeanwhile, derivatives markets experienced significant action with open interest across futures exploding to a record high of $16.48 Billion, eclipsing the previous peak by over $3.48 Billion.\n\nIn true Elon form, a whopping $438m in short interest were liquidated between Binance and OKEx on the news.\n\nReaction of Natural Sellers\n\nThere are two principal natural sellers of BTC during bull markets, miners and holders of older coins who accumulated in the past and are realising profits.\n\nAfter a period of increased miner distribution during the rally and subsequent consolidation throughout January, miners have actually eased off their sell pressure this week. This suggests that miners have either completed adequate sales to cover costs, or could also mean they see Tesla's vote of confidence as fair reason to keep a strong grip on their treasuries.\n\nHODLer's of older coins however, appear to have taken advantage of the market strength to move their coins and potentially sell into the move. The Elon Candle has lifted the average age of coins spent from 30-days to 58-days, as shown in the (Average Spent Output Lifespan indicator (ASOL).\n\nA very similar observation can be made for the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric which tracks when old coins are on the move. Both the CDD and ASOL indictaors demonstrate that older coins have been on the move since BTC/USD price was around $12k, and have been moving at an increasing pace. This behaviour slowed during the consolidation in January, and has started ramping back up this week.\n\nThis weeks feature topic, located at the end of this post, presents an overview of the ASOL metric for those interested to learn more about its interpretation, and how to use it in your analysis.\nAltcoin Feature: Uniswap Token (UNI)\n\nAnother asset which has seen significant positive price performance, alongside a drawdown in exchange balances, is the Uniswap Token (UNI). After exchange balances peaked at 36.86M UNI in early January, a 10% outflow of 5.323M UNI tokens has occurred, supporting a price rally from $6.33 to over $23.26 (a 367% gain).\n\nOver this same period of time, the number of intra-day transactions transferring UNI tokens tripled from 277tx/hr to a peak of 830tx/hr. Since the 1-Feb however there has been a marked slow-down of transactions counts for UNI tokens despite continued price appreciation.\n\nThese relatively simple metrics (exchange balance and transaction rates) demonstrate how token activity on-chain can provide insight into aggregate market sentiment and behaviour.\n\nWeekly Feature: Interpreting the ASOL Indicator\n\nAverage Spent Outputs Lifespan (ASOL) is a useful indicator for filtering out changes in older coin spending behaviour. This provides insight into the actions of longer term and smart money hodlers.\n\nIn general, older coins (i.e. ones which have not moved in a relatively long time) are held by strong hands with high conviction in the asset. Each day, the ASOL (unit in days) metric calculates the average age of spent coins. Some examples:\n\nAn ASOL value of 5-days means that on average, the coins spent that day were relatively young and thus were likely purchased recently (short term movements, likely day to day traders).\nAn ASOL value of 50-days however, means there were a reasonable number of old coins spent to lift the average. Perhaps a small few ancient coins (> 3yr old) moved, or it could represent be a larger volume of coins bought 1-3yrs ago in the last bear market.\n\nWe can see in the chart below that ASOL values greater than 100-days tend to occur during strong bullish impulses as strong hands sell into strength. Conversely, relatively low ASOL values less than 50-days are typical of bear markets as interest wanes and off-chain exchange volume dominates, and early bull markets during the disbelief phase.\n\nRemember, the older a coin is, the larger the impact it has on the ASOL indicator (and vice versa). This metric is also independent of the volume of coins transferred, it considers only the time since a coin was last spent. The Coin Days Destroyed indicator does consider age and coin volume so is a perfect counterpart to the ASOL indicator.\n\nYou can find the ASOL metric on Glassnode Studio here.\n\nProduct Updates\nAdded CME Ether futures\nNew sidebar layout (Top navigation bar is now scroll-able)\nSticky dashboard tools on scroll\nEnable scale drop-down on Futures latest/current metrics\nReleased Grayscale metrics and dashboard.\nFeatures\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

After starting the week at $33,060, it climbed consistently and reached a peak of $40,820 on Saturday before dipping slightly, ending the week at $38,760 (an increase of 17% for the week).\n\nFor the Bulls\n\nBTC's liquid supply is continuing to decrease as investors increasingly acquire and hodl the asset for the long term. Currently, around 78% of issued bitcoin are either lost or being hodled.\n\nThis leaves less than 4 million BTC to be shared amongst future market entrants - including large institutional investors such as PayPal, Square, S&P500 companies, ETFs and the like.\n\nWith float in the network drying up faster than ever, signs are promising for continued BTC price increases into the future.\n\nFor the Bears\n\nSince early January, BTC miner net position change has remained in the negative figures, indicating that miners have been decreasing their positions and taking profits.\n\nThis may appear slightly bearish - however, it comes after a long period of miner accumulation throughout 2020 while the price of BTC was low. As such, it comes across as more of an opportunistic move to cover the previous year's operating costs while the BTC price remains high. Further, it appears to be returning to neutral, suggesting that this selling activity is coming to an end.\n\nA Bullish Comment from Willy Woo\n\nWoo's Take: The larger macro is bullish.\n\nThe larger time frame continues to be bullish, a break to the upside out of the $42k consolidation resistance is what I expect in the coming weeks.\n\nWhile the price dip has shaken out many of the new buyers who came in under FOMO, the buyers on the other hand are sophisticated (rich) investors with strong hands.\n\nWhales have been adding to their balances throughout this dip, and new whales continue to be birthed. This shows that new coins have been bought by strong hands.\n\nRead more from Willy Woo in his newsletter, The Bitcoin Forecast.\n\nAltcoin Feature: Ethereum Miner Revenue Hits New All-Time High\n\nLast Friday, Ethereum miners earned $3.74 million in a single hour - the highest ever hourly revenue for the network. Total miner revenue for the same day was over $55 million, another all-time high for Ethereum.\n\nWith gas fees staying consistently high (especially in USD terms) as of late - and with gas-heavy smart contract-based transactions becoming the norm - miners in the network are earning more than ever.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nWeekly Feature: BTC Ownership is Much Less Concentrated than Often Reported\n\nThe common narrative that \"2% of accounts control 95% of all BTC\" is incorrect. In fact, BTC ownership is much less concentrated than often reported, and has dispersed over time. We highlight this phenomenon in our recent analysis of BTC's supply distribution.\n\nThe chart below shows the supply distribution across entities over time. In particular, it becomes apparent that the (relative) amount of BTC held by smaller entities has been growing over the course of Bitcoin's lifetime; a trend that continues to endure.\n\nSince 2017, the smallest players (shrimps & crabs) have increased their holdings by 130%. The second smallest holders (octopus & fish) have also grown their supply by 14% in this time period.\n\nOn the other hand, large entities (dolphins & sharks as well as whales & humpbacks) have decreased their BTC ownership by -3% and -7%, respectively.\n\nFrom our data, we can derive that around 2% of network entities control 71.5% of all BTC. Note that this figure is substantially different from the often propagated \"2% control 95% of the supply\".\n\nRead the full analysis on Glassnode Insights:\n\nNo, Bitcoin Ownership is not Highly Concentrated – But Whales are Accumulating\nWe analyze the distribution of Bitcoin across network participants, and show that BTC ownership disperses over time and is much less concentrated than often reported. Meanwhile, BTC supply held by whales has recently increased, suggesting institutional investors are entering.\nGlassnode Insights - On-Chain Market Intelligence\nRafael Schultze-Kraft\nSpecial Offer: Free Month of Glassnode Advanced\n\nWe've partnered with ZUBR to offer a free month of Glassnode Advanced to users who sign up and trade crypto perpetuals on their platform.\n\nZUBR is a derivatives exchange built by HFT-traders, featuring guaranteed microsecond execution of trades with only 0.01% trading fees.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 5, 2021)\n\nBTC has remained relatively stable over the past week, while DeFi has its day with another week of strong performance. On-chain fundamentals for bitcoin remain strong.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nFeb 1, 2021 • 4 min read\nAnnouncing Our Latest Newsletter: Uncharted\n\nWe have recently started a bi-weekly newsletter, Uncharted. This newsletter covers BTC from both an on-chain and off-chain data perspective, and uses beautiful charts and brief commentaries to give readers an intuitive snapshot of what is happening in the markets.\n\nCheck out Uncharted on our Substack, and subscribe now!\n\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBTC had a relatively stable week, starting out at $32,300 and ending the week at $33,060. On Friday, however, it rapidly shot up to over $38,000, before dropping back down again before the end of the day and slowly declining for the remainder of the week.\n\nFor the Bulls\n\nBTC's Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) has been declining in 2021 as more stablecoins are minted. When SSR is low, this means that there is a large supply of stablecoins relative to BTC, which indicates more buying power ready to flow into BTC and other assets.\n\nSSR is a ratio of the total value of all bitcoins vs. stablecoins - as such, it decreases when the price of BTC is low or when more stablecoins are entering circulation. The fact that SSR is so low even as BTC maintains high prices demonstrates just how many new stablecoins have entered the ecosystem recently.\n\nFurthermore, many of these newly minted stablecoins are being deposited onto exchanges, meaning that they are highly liquid and ready to buy up assets such as BTC.\n\nFor the Bears\n\nAfter spiking in early January 2021, the number of active entities on the Bitcoin network decreased significantly, returning to its previous trajectory. While this metric has since begun to increase again, it has still not returned to levels seen at the top of the market in January.\n\nThis news is not so much bearish as it is slightly-less-bullish. It shows that the spike up to over $40k was driven by (and led to) an increase in activity, which has since decreased as the price has dropped. However, this decrease looks more like a healthy correction than a shift towards a bearish trend, so investors should not be worried based on this metric.\n\nA Bullish Comment from Willy Woo\n\nWoo's Take: The market has completed a full purge of overheatedness.\n\nOnce selling commences, the selling pressure begets more sellers taking their profits while it’s still there. Profit-taking has now completed. We can see this in the SOPR chart below. When SOPR touches the 1.0 line, coins moving between investors no longer carry profit.\n\nTo push SOPR lower, investors would have to be willing to sell at a loss. In order to allow for that, we would need to enter a bearish phase, but this is very unlikely as we are bounded by the $29k price floor.\n\nRead more from Willy Woo in his newsletter, The Bitcoin Forecast.\n\nAltcoin Feature: USDC is Seeing Massive Exchange Inflows in 2021\n\nAfter growing slowly since 2018, the number of USDC on exchanges has begun to rapidly increase as of 2021. This trend is bringing more buying power into the crypto market, acting as a potential catalyst waiting on the sidelines, ready to flow into BTC and other cryptoassets.\n\nThe number of USDC on exchanges increased by over 112% in January alone, growing from $431 million to over $915 million. This represents almost $1 billion worth of buying power from USDC alone, poised to move into assets such as BTC.\n\nThis high figure should increase investors' confidence in any dips being quickly bought up, making it a bullish signal.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nWeekly Feature: Grayscale Holdings Acquiring BTC Faster than it is Being Mined\n\nIn 2021 so far, around 26,000 BTC have been mined. Meanwhile, digital asset investment fund Grayscale Holdings has acquired over 40,000 BTC in the same period.\n\nThis means that, looking at Grayscale's acquisitions alone, the available BTC supply is drying up faster than it is being created. This is before we consider the other significant institutional investments into BTC this year, which have been extremely large.\n\nThese large investments have been drying up BTC's liquid supply, as seen in the red areas below. 2021 has seen the largest sustained decrease in bitcoin's liquid supply in the history of BTC.\n\nWith BTC's supply being continually bought up by large investors and institutions, new price floors are being set at higher and higher levels. This continued restriction of supply places bitcoin in a bullish zone.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Meanwhile, the rest of the crypto market is growing even faster.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nJan 25, 2021 • 4 min read\nAnnouncing Our Latest Newsletter: Uncharted\n\nWe have recently started a brand new bi-weekly newsletter, Uncharted. This newsletter covers BTC from both an on-chain and off-chain data perspective, and uses beautiful charts and brief commentaries to give readers an intuitive snapshot of what is happening in the markets.\n\nCheck out Uncharted on our Substack, and subscribe now!\n\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin had another tumultuous week, dropping below $30k for the first time since early January. After starting the week at $35,870, it begun to decline on Wednesday, reaching a low of $29,100 early on Friday morning before gradually rising and ending the week at $32,300. Overall, it lost 10% over the past week.\n\nFor the Bulls\n\nBitcoin's aSOPR (Adjusted SOPR) has reset after increasing for over several months. This means that coins moving between investors per hour (24h MA) are, on average, no longer being sold at a profit. In order for SOPR to go lower, investors would have to be willing to sell at a loss, which is unlikely given the current shape of the market.\n\nAs mentioned in previous newsletters, we have been looking for this reset in order to generate some stability in the market and pave the way for the next bull run. The chart above suggests that the current correction is coming to an end, providing a bullish signal.\n\nFor the Bears\n\nBitcoin's NUPL (Net Unrealized Profit/Loss) is getting close to exceeding the green \"Belief\" range and moving into the blue \"Euphoria\" range. Previously, when NUPL has entered this range, this has signaled a global top (as signaled by the red circles below).\n\nThis may come across to some wary investors as representing the global top for this bull market. However, if you zoom in on this chart, it becomes clear that NUPL did not quite hit the blue range at its peak earlier this month. Its brush with the blue zone more closely resembles a similar event in mid-2017 (as shown by the green circles in the chart).\n\nAfter this event in 2017, BTC still increased by over 900%, showing that a near miss of the blue zone does not rule out significant further growth for bitcoin. In addition, other on-chain indicators suggest much more room for growth for BTC.\n\nA Bullish Comment from Willy Woo\n\nWoo's Take: Investment activity is very high, buying dominates.\n\nThe quantity of coins moving between investors remains very high. While normally we see discrete impulses of coin movements, this last month just looks like a single very large buying impulse, I’ve been calling this the “mother of all impulses”.\n\nThis is bullish and should provide fuel for further upside once consolidation completes.\n\nRead more from Willy Woo in his newsletter, The Bitcoin Forecast.\n\nAltcoin Feature: ETH Hits New ATH of Over $1400\n\nETH has hit a new all-time high after testing $1400 last week and then dropping down to just over $1000. Now at $1440 and rising, it looks set to increase even further.\n\nMeanwhile, ETH had an extremely high number of exchange withdrawals last week, with over one million ETH leaving exchanges as investors look to hold for the longer term.\n\nThis is a strong bullish signal, as it indicates confidence in ETH's capacity for growth in the near and longer term.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nWeekly Feature: Number of BTC Whales Shoots Past Previous ATH\n\nThe number of BTC whales (entities holding at least 1000 BTC) has begun rapidly increasing after passing its previous all-time high in late December. Since the beginning of the year, we have seen the creation of 185 new bitcoin whales - an increase of 11% in January alone.\n\nThis is by far the most rapid increase in whales ever seen in the history of BTC. This indicates that large holders are acquiring more BTC, and the recent high number of OTC deals suggests that institutional investors are part of this cohort. The continued demand for BTC among large holders indicates ongoing bullish sentiment.\n\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

But despite a possible further correction, long-term on-chain metrics remain bullish.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nJan 18, 2021 • 5 min read\nAnnouncing Our Latest Newsletter: Uncharted\n\nWe have recently started a brand new bi-weekly newsletter, Uncharted. This newsletter covers BTC from both an on-chain and off-chain data perspective, and uses beautiful charts and brief commentaries to give readers an intuitive snapshot of what is happening in the markets.\n\nCheck out Uncharted on our Substack, and subscribe now!\n\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin had a slow week for the first time in over a month, losing almost 7% of its value. After starting the week at $38,360, it rapidly declined on Monday morning, reaching a low of just over $30,500. In the middle of the week, it almost reached $40k before declining once again, ending the week at $35,775.\n\nFor the Bulls\n\nThe number of BTC held in accumulation addresses has exceeded 2.7 million - a 17% increase in a single year. Accumulation addresses are addresses (excluding miner and exchange addresses) which have only ever received BTC and have never spent them.\n\nThis increase highlights the massive supply restriction that is occurring in the BTC market, with almost 15% of the total supply held in these addresses. When combined with the general decrease in bitcoin's liquid supply and the number of lost coins, this leads to an even more limited supply, which is helping BTC maintain the highest prices it has ever seen.\n\nFor the Bears\n\nDespite bitcoin's strong on-chain fundamentals and its impressive gains as of late, a further correction may still be in order. BTC's entity-adjusted SOPR is still at very high levels, and has not reset back to 1 in several months.\n\nA reset in SOPR usually precedes price stabilization and paves the way for the next bull run. With SOPR levels this high, even if we see some upside now, further (healthy) pullbacks in the mid-term are not unlikely. With that said, overall on-chain metrics remain long-term bullish for BTC.\n\nA Comment from Willy Woo\n\nWoo's Take: Traders should prepare for a worst case wick down to a price floor of approximately $29k under current capital flow models. However, with whale numbers at an all time high, we are seeing a very strong indicator that we are still early in this bull market.\n\nBitcoin is now in a consolidation band with strong fundamentals of whale buyers supporting the rally to current levels.\n\nThe chart below shows my most responsive model for determining the fundamental floor price of BTC. It’s based on investor capital flowing into the network. This model has backtraced successfully over the 12 years of Bitcoin’s bull markets and is proprietary to The Bitcoin Forecast.\n\nThe floor presently sits at $29k. While I don’t necessarily expect price will wick downwards that low, traders should prepare for this as worse case scenario. This model tells us we are trading in a regime where a pull-back would be contained within a range of 20%-33% from highs (using daily candle closes).\n\nRead more from Willy Woo in his newsletter, The Bitcoin Forecast.\n\nAltcoin Feature: Over 81% of LINK is Held by the Top 1% of Addresses\n\nThe proportion of LINK held by the top 1% has reached a new all-time high of over 81%, after steadily climbing for the past several years. Even as LINK smashes through previous price records, its top holders appear to be acquiring more and more of this high-performing asset.\n\nWith LINK up over 46% across the past week, demand for the asset appears to be higher than ever. Over the past several months, the token's circulating supply has increased by over 50 million units (14%) due to the protocol's parent company selling some of its share of tokens. But despite this increase in supply, LINK continues to increase in price while simultaneously becoming more concentrated.\n\nThe continued concentration of supply suggests that, even with the available supply increasing, LINK's top holders are still bullish on the token, and are continuing to acquire more. This is a positive sign for LINK, as it demonstrates ongoing support and bullish sentiment from the existing community.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nWeekly Feature: Controversy over BTC's Stock to Flow Model\n\nThe much-debated stock to flow (S2F) model of valuing BTC has seen some renewed controversy as of late, with two camps forming regarding whether or not the model is, in fact, valid and predictive.\n\nS2F claims to predict bitcoin's price based on a ratio which compares the existing supply of BTC with how much is entering circulation. For the past decade, it has more or less predicted BTC's price movements, and the model has forecast continued increases as the supply of bitcoin continues to dry up.\n\nHowever, despite having been historically predictive, the model, introduced by anonymous crypto investor PlanB, has been shot down by many. PlanB has recently claimed that S2F is \"on track... like clockwork\", but other analysts claim that it is baseless.\n\nAnalyst Alex Krüger is one of the model's detractors, stating: \"It is nonsensical to think that bitcoin S2F... can be used to predict price.\" He claims that S2F is based on a \"spurious relationship\" between price and scarcity, an opinion which seems wise when the model is extended further into the future.\n\nBy 2045, S2F estimates a price of $235 trillion per bitcoin, with the price eventually converging to infinity as bitcoin’s flow approaches zero. As identified by many analysts, this kind of projection is clearly unrealistic, and creates damaging expectations for the price of BTC.\n\nCory Klippstein agrees with this view, stating that: \"It's extremely important to be bullish for the right reasons.  Otherwise you'll have weak hands when your belief is proven false.\"\n\nRecap of my issues with the S2F and S2FX models of @100trillionUSD:\n\nIt's extremely important to be bullish for the right reasons. Otherwise you'll have weak hands when your belief is proven false.\n1/\n\n— Cory SwanBitcoin.com 🦢 (@coryklippsten) September 25, 2020\n\nThis does not mean that BTC will not increase significantly in price in the future - but it does paint a valid warning about the dangers of relying on models which are subject to selection bias in their fundamental basis. As such, while investors can remain bullish for the time being, models like S2F should be examined and applied with caution.\n\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 2, 2021)\n\nBTC had another stellar week, exceeding $40k for the first time ever - more than double its 2017 ATH. However, a correction and some sideways movement may be in order before further growth is seen.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nJan 11, 2021 • 5 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nWeek after week, BTC continues to make impressive gains, reaching yet another all-time high this past week as it shot over $40k for the first time ever. After starting the week at $32,780, it climbed consistently until it reached a high of over $41,900 on Friday, before dropping slightly to end the week at $40,730.\n\nEarly on Monday morning (European time), BTC and the rest of the market dipped suddenly, with bitcoin losing over 10% of its value in just 2 hours. It quickly bounced back, recovering most of its value as the dip was rapidly bought up by eager investors, but has since continued to decline, dropping below $32k.\n\nFor the Bulls\n\nAs BTC continues to rise in price, its adoption and usage are also growing, with the number of active addresses reaching a new all-time high for the first time since the late 2017 bull market top.\n\nAt its highest point last week, over 1.3 million Bitcoin addresses were active in a single day. This continued spike indicates an impressive level of new adoption and activity for BTC, and suggests that the number of market participants in the network may be higher than ever before.\n\nFor the Bears\n\nBitcoin's aSOPR (Adjusted SOPR) is extremely high, and hasn't reset back to zero in over 3 months, as it periodically does on the way up. In 2017, aSOPR surged without resetting for 3 months as well – until BTC reached the top.\n\nWhile on-chain indicators remain macro bullish, this extreme spike in profit-taking suggests that some kind of correction may be imminent.\n\nA Bullish Comment from Willy Woo\n\nWoo's Take: Investor activity continues to be strongly bullish.\n\nBullish capital flows continue to be strong, keeping the speculative price premium above the estimated fundamental valuation in check. This rally while warming up is no more overheated than late November when the price topped $17k consolidated and continued onwards very quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, looking into the shorter term investment flows happening on spot exchanges, investors are strongly buying this all-time-high.\n\nRead more from Willy Woo in his newsletter, The Bitcoin Forecast.\n\nAltcoin Feature: MKR's Comeback and Bull Run\n\nAfter languishing behind the rest of the DeFi token market and failing to maker significant price gains for the past year, MKR (the native governance token of MakerDAO) suddenly shot up last week from below $600 to an all-time high of $1973.29, which it reached early on Sunday.\n\nHowever, it has quickly fallen back down after hitting this high, losing over a third of its value in less than 24 hours.\n\nMKR has remained mostly stagnant for the past 6 months, but it recently shot up in price (Glassnode Studio)\n\nNews outlets credited \"DeFi growth\" for the surge in MKR's price, but that doesn't explain why this relatively stable token has suddenly bucked its previous trend to catch up with the rest of the DeFi market. Rather, the increase in the token's price can more likely be attributed to a massive increase in demand for DAI, the stablecoin generated by the MakerDAO protocol.\n\nThe MKR price spiked at the same time as demand for DAI rapidly increased (Glassnode Studio)\n\nWith demand for stablecoins increasing, and the interest rate for borrowing DAI now sitting above zero, yield seekers have more of an incentive to hold MKR, as it can generate revenue in the form of interest repayments. Whether or not it continues to hold this price remains to be seen, but it is clear that the MKR token was well overdue to regain some of its lost ground against the rest of the DeFi market.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nWeekly Feature: Ethereum Flips Bitcoin in Terms of Network Fees\n\n2020 was the first year ever during which more fees were spent on the Ethereum blockchain than on Bitcoin; users spent almost $600 million in fees on Ethereum transactions last year – 83% more than on Bitcoin. This shows an interesting trend in the evolution of competition among different chains.\n\nThis change can be interpreted in a number of ways. It could be seen as illustrating that ETH is capturing more value than BTC, and is therefore poised to flip bitcoin in terms of market cap in the future. However, some may also interpret this as a sign that Ethereum's infrastructure is underdeveloped, and that it is not capable of competing with BTC when it comes to cost of transacting.\n\nEither way, with ETH2.0 in the pipeline, it is entirely possible that this trend will flip back in the coming years, with Bitcoin consuming more fees once again. However, if Ethereum continues to capture more value in terms of overall usage, its valuation could continue to creep closer to BTC.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nEntity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow (BTC) - A new metric used to time market lows and assess whether the bull market remains in relatively normal conditions.\nSupply Liquidity Metrics (BTC) - Liquid and Illiquid Supply, Liquid Supply Change, Illiquid Supply Change.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

But ETH is the real winner of the week, gaining over 37% in a single day.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nJan 4, 2021 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin had yet another impressive week over the New Year period, reaching new all-time highs and exceeding $30k for the first time. After starting the week at $26,270, it increased continually, reaching a high of $34,550 before dipping slightly to end the week at $32,685.\n\nFor the Bulls\n\nAs BTC's price continues to rise, widespread retail interest in bitcoin is increasing, with the number of address holding a non-zero amount of BTC reaching an all-time high of over 33 million.\n\nHowever, while news coverage and retail interest in bitcoin are rapidly growing, the number of daily new BTC addresses has still not reached 2017 levels. This metric's steady and consistent growth (as opposed to the sudden peak seen in the last major bull market) suggests that BTC is experiencing strong organic growth in adoption, but not the sort of viral growth typical of a bubble.\n\nThese metrics therefore paint a bullish picture of a market characterized by healthy, sustainable growth as opposed to hype.\n\nA Bullish Comment from Willy Woo\n\nWoo's Take: In the long range, exchange inventory structure points to a good year ahead.\n\nInventory depletion on spot exchanges has stopped, signifying the re-accumulation phase of the macro cycle is likely complete. The chart below marks where we are in the overall macro cycle through the lens of spot inventory.\n\nWhat causes inventory to increase in later stages of the bull market? Retail tends to store their coins on exchanges which attributes to a net inventory climb. This typifies the main phase of the bull market. Since we already know institutions are buying in large quantities, the flattening of spot inventory depletion is a sign that retail buyers are now entering in large volumes, attracted by recent price rises.\n\nRead more from Willy Woo in his newsletter, The Bitcoin Forecast.\n\nAltcoin Feature: ETH's Bull Run\n\nETH's spectacular Sunday bull run saw it gain over 37% in a single day, propelling it to the $1000 mark and representing an almost 750% price increase from the same point last year, when it sat below $140.\n\nThe last time ETH reached this price was 3 years ago, in January 2018, when it spent less than a month above $1000 before dropping back down into the triple digits. However, on-chain signals suggest that we are still in the earlier stages of a bull market, relative to the same price levels in 2018.\n\nFor example, its MVRV Ratio (which indicates when an asset may be overvalued) is still extremely low relative to early 2018, when the price was equivalent to current levels.\n\nWhen MVRV was this low leading up to the 2017 bull run, ETH was still under $25, and experienced a massive 5800% increase before reaching its all-time high. This indicates that in the current market, there is room for significant further growth before ETH becomes overvalued.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nWeekly Feature: Bitcoin's Liquidity Crisis Continues\n\nBitcoin liquidity is continually getting squashed as investors continue hoarding and hodling, and the available supply is becoming scarcer.\n\nThroughout 2020, the \"Illiquid Supply\" liquidity class for BTC has grown increasingly larger, while liquid and highly liquid supply are decreasing.\n\nThis is a highly bullish sign, as scarcity leads to an increase in demand relative to supply, driving up price. This chart also implies that the recent influx of new retail investors are more likely to be hodling rather than realizing gains at this point, suggesting more room for growth from both the retail and institutional sectors.\n\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 52, 2020)\n\nBTC has continued to grow throughout the last week of the year, reaching a new ATH of over $28k. On-chain signals remain bullish, showing a significant supply side crisis for bitcoin.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nDec 28, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBTC continued its rapid bull run over the past week, continuing to hit new all-time highs and rapidly climbing to exceed $28,000. After starting the week at $23,480, it rose consistently, reaching a high of $28,289. However, on Sunday, it started to decrease slightly, closing out the week at $26,390.\n\nFor the Bulls\n\nDespite BTC's extreme price gains over the past month, its Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) is still relatively low, at a value of 0.67. This means it is still in the green \"belief\" zone, and hasn't yet reached the blue \"euphoria\" zone that usually represents market tops.\n\nThis relatively low NUPL value indicates that BTC has more room to grow before the top, despite being well above its previous all-time high already. For comparison, when NUPL was at its current value during the 2017 bull run, BTC was only $5622, and still increased by 248% before the top. If bitcoin follows this trend again, it would translate to a market top of $65,500.\n\nThis makes BTC's low NUPL value a bullish signal, as it demonstrates that bitcoin has plenty of room for growth before a market top is reached.\n\nA Bullish Comment from Willy Woo\n\nWoo's Take: $200k+ is possible in 2021\n\nWe are now past the all-time-high juncture where my Top Cap model starts curving upwards. While this model does not predict a price, it can estimate a ceiling on price for a point in the future, it has hit every macro market top in Bitcoins history.\n\nAssuming the price tops out in December 2021 following prior market cycles, a $100k target would be overly conservative, a target of $200k-$300k would be considered realistic.\n\nRead more from Willy Woo in his newsletter, The Bitcoin Forecast.\n\nAltcoin Feature: ETH Balance on Exchanges is Increasing\n\nAfter decreasing for most of the year, the balance of ETH on centralized exchanges has begun to increase this month.\n\nBTC and ETH both saw marked decreases in their exchange balance this year, as trust in centralized institutions fell and more investors withdrew their assets to hodl for the longer term. However, as of mid-December, the number of ETH on exchanges has started to increase again.\n\nWhile this may be seen as bearish for ETH (as it could indicate intent to sell), there is an alternative explanation for this rise. Most of the increase in ether's exchange balance occurred on Bitfinex, which launched loans for BTC and ETH on 18 December.\n\nAs such, the increase can likely be explained by investors using Bitfinex Borrow to borrow ETH, an interpretation which is supported by a similar increase in the number of BTC on Bitfinex at the same time. This implies that investors are taking long positions rather than preparing to sell, which is a bullish signal for ETH.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nWeekly Feature: Bitcoin's Supply Side Crisis\n\nOn-chain metrics show extremely bullish signals surrounding BTC's available supply, suggesting that demand is far outstripping supply. This has been reflected in the recent price increases, which placed BTC at an all-time high as an increasing number of buyers drive the price up.\n\nOur co-founder Rafael Schultze-Kraft recently identified some of the core metrics that show this supply and liquidity crisis.\n\n#Bitcoin is in a supply and liquidity crisis.\n\nThis is extremely bullish! And highly underrated.\n\nI believe we will see this significantly reflected in Bitcoin's price in the upcoming months.\n\nLet's take a look at the data.\n\nA thread 👇👇👇 pic.twitter.com/vx6rJmiloE\n\n— Rafael Schultze-Kraft (@n3ocortex) December 21, 2020\n\nFor example, the number of BTC in accumulation addresses is steadily increasing. Accumulation addresses are addresses which have only ever received BTC and have never spent them.\n\nThe number of BTC in these addresses represents 14.5% of the total supply, which is one of the many factors causing a massive restriction in supply.\n\nIn addition, bitcoin's Adjusted Circulating Supply shows that the total supply of BTC will only be around 16 million (rather the expected 21 million) due to lost coins. With high demand also coming from institutional investors, BTC's supply will likely continue to be restricted, paving the way for further increases in price.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 51, 2020)\n\nBTC smashed through its previous all-time high to find support above $23k for the first time ever. Meanwhile, on-chain fundamentals remain strongly bullish for BTC and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nDec 21, 2020 • 5 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin had a stellar week of growth, smashing through its previous all-time high to find support above $23k for the first time ever. After starting the week at $19,150, BTC rose rapidly over Wednesday and Thursday and continued to make gains throughout the rest of the week. All in all, it saw a 23% price increase, ending the week at $23,510.\n\nFor the Bulls\n\nBitcoin's Reserve Risk remains extremely low despite the price passing its previous all-time high, indicating a favorable risk/reward ratio for investing.\n\nReserve Risk is used to assess the confidence of long-term holders relative to the price of BTC; when confidence is high and price is low, Reserve Risk remains low, and there is an attractive risk/reward to invest (learn more).\n\nBitcoin's Reserve Risk currently remains close to the green zone despite significant upward price movements, suggesting that there is high confidence in BTC at this price point.\n\nWhen Reserve Risk was at similarly low levels during the 2017 bull run, the price of bitcoin was still under $2000, and saw a 923% increase before the top. If BTC were to follow this same trend in the current market, it would translate to a market top of almost $220,000.\n\nFor the Bears\n\nAs we forecast in last week's newsletter, BTC's recent downward correction in Entity-Adjusted SOPR was indeed a signal of an approaching upwards trend. The downward trend has now reversed, suggesting that BTC's sideways movement below $20k may be well and truly behind us, with new support levels staying above $23k for the time being.\n\nHowever, in bull markets, similar spikes in SOPR are usually followed by sideways or more gradual upwards price movement before the next acceleration.\n\nAs such, although on-chain indicators are still macro-bullish, this trend indicates that we may see some sideways movement for BTC before the next price spike. While this news is not bearish per se, it does suggest that there are some limitations on BTC's growth in the very short term, despite the overall environment remaining bullish.\n\nA Bullish Comment from Willy Woo\n\nWoo's Take: We are in a solid bullish environment over the next few months.\n\nThe Bitcoin Difficulty Ribbon, is a reliable medium term indicator tracking the contraction and expansion of mining hash power on the network. Expansions out of a compressed zone are bullish.\n\nThe recent approach towards all-time-highs coincided with a contraction in the ribbon; now, it’s once again in an expansion. We are in a solid bullish environment over the medium term environment (next 3 months).\n\nRead more from Willy Woo in his newsletter, The Bitcoin Forecast.\n\nAltcoin Feature: Litecoin Outperforms Top 10 Cryptocurrencies\n\nOver the past week, Litecoin has experienced a meteoric rise, gaining almost 40% over 7 days and significantly outperforming the rest of the top 10 cryptocurrencies. While it is still far from its ATH of $375, its gains over the past week suggest that it is regaining popularity after falling out of the top 10 earlier this year.\n\nMeanwhile, litecoin's MVRV Ratio remains low, at just 1.6 compared with bitcoin's 2.9. This ratio of market cap to realized cap indicates that LTC is relatively undervalued in comparison with BTC, suggesting room for further growth before it becomes overvalued.\n\nLitecoin's MVRV Ratio is also well below its 2017 high of 3.7, further suggesting that this often underestimated cryptocurrency is well poised to make a comeback.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nWeekly Feature: ETH2.0 Staking Contract Exceeds $1 billion in ETH Staked\n\nThe value of ETH staked in the new ETH2.0 staking contract has exceeded $1 billion USD for the first time.\n\nAfter meeting its minimum staking goal on 24 November, the contract has seen continued deposits from participants hoping to stake in ETH2.0, now sitting at almost 1.7 million ETH; over 320% of its initial goal.\n\nThe past few days have seen a marked increase in the rate at which ETH is staked in the contract. So far, 1.5% of the total ETH supply has been staked, a number which is only expected to increase as more ETH holders seek high yields from ETH2.0 staking.\n\nI don't think people fully comprehend the upside of ETH2.0 staking\n\nAt the min ETH staked, you get roughly 36%~ APY.\n\nAt 1M ETH 18%~ APY.\n\nAt 2.5M 10.2% APY.\n\nGiven slow uptake, early birds are going to make massive profit pic.twitter.com/zXWA5QzZ6q\n\n— Adam Cochran (@AdamScochran) November 9, 2020\n\nWith over 125,000 addresses still holding at least 32 ETH (the minimum required amount for a single node), at least 4 million ETH (over $2.5 billion USD) is still immediately available to be staked.\n\nWith such lucrative opportunities for yield with minimal risk, the number of staked ETH can be expected to continually increase, restricting circulating ETH supply and contributing to scarcity. This, in combination with the growing number of ETH locked in DeFi protocols, suggests positive price implications for ETH as its supply is further restricted.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nRealized HODL Ratio (BTC) - A market indicator that uses a ratio of Realized Cap HODL Waves to indicate when the market may be overvalued.\nMedian Transaction Fees (BTC, ETH, LTC) - The median fee per transaction, excluding minted/mined coins.\nTotal Number of UTXOs (BTC, LTC) - The total number of UTXOs in the network.\nFeatures\nTradingView Integration (beta) - As requested by our users, we have integrated TradingView into the Glassnode Studio interface!

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 50, 2020)\n\nBTC started and ended the past week just above $19k, failing to top its recent ATH. But despite its mostly sideways movement over the past few weeks, on-chain signals remain long-term bullish.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nDec 14, 2020 • 5 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nAfter starting Week 50 at $19,360, BTC started to gradually decline in price, reaching a weekly low of $17,640 on Friday. After this point, though, it quickly began to rebound, ending the week back above $19k at $19,180.\n\nFor the Bulls\n\nBitcoin's Long-Term Holder MVRV Ratio (LTH-MVRV) is currently providing an extremely bullish signal. MVRV is the ratio of market cap to realized cap, and gives an indication of when the traded price of BTC is above or below \"fair value\"; LTH-MVRV is a variant of this metric that accounts for coins which are at least 155 days old.\n\nWhen LTH-MVRV reaches the red zone (above 20), this generally indicates a global top. But as we can see in the chart below, bitcoin's LTH-MVRV is still very far from the red zone.\n\nIn fact, the last time LTH-MVRV was this low during a bull run, the price of BTC was barely over $1000, and still experienced a 1432% increase before the top. If bitcoin were to follow the same trend again, this would translate to a market top of over $270,000 for this bull market.\n\nFor the Bears\n\nDespite overwhelmingly bullish on-chain signals, bitcoin's entity-adjusted SOPR may indicate some short-term bearish sentiment. SOPR shows the extent to which BTC holders are selling at a profit or loss; a value above 1 indicates that sales are on average occurring at a profit, while a value below 1 indicates sales at a loss.\n\nBitcoin's entity-adjusted SOPR is still comfortably above 1, but it has been declining since late November, indicating that the amount of profit being realized is decreasing, despite price staying relatively consistent during this period.\n\nThese kinds of dips in SOPR usually indicate micro-bearish sentiment, as sellers are taking less profit. However, historically, these represent more of a shake-out than a trend reversal. In fact, when SOPR declines during a bull market, this usually corresponds with sideways price movement; then, when it approaches or dips below 1, this consistently results in an upwards price correction.\n\nAs such, even though SOPR's decline may appear to imply bearish sentiment, it is actually a signal of an approaching upwards trend. Investors should keep an eye on SOPR's decline to identify a potential local bottom before the next bull run.\n\nA Bullish Comment from Willy Woo\n\nWoo's Take: Despite an imminent retrace seeming likely, the greater environment is of continued buyer demand.\n\nWhile SOPR indicates profit taking is still in process, net flows are once again leaving the exchanges which indicates continued spot buyer demand. This buying pressure will mitigate and any large downside move.\n\nIn other words, large pullback targets like $14k even $15.5k which I’ve seen floating around are very unlikely, this would take some bearish changes to the on-chain structure which simply have not developed yet. We are in a solid bullish environment over the medium term environment (next 3 months).\n\nRead more from Willy Woo in his newsletter, The Bitcoin Forecast.\n\nAltcoin Feature: Stablecoin Lockup is Increasing - But So is their Buying Power\n\nAfter dropping sharply following the end of UNI farming, the supply of stablecoins locked in smart contracts has begun to increase once again over the past few weeks. This new upward trend can be seen across USDC, USDT, and DAI.\n\nAs more stablecoins are locked up - usually for yield farming purposes - the supply available to be moved into non-stable coins (such as BTC and ETH) decreases, lowering the available \"buying power\" for these assets. However, this effect is countered by the continued large increases in stablecoin supply, which more than makes up for the increase in locked stablecoins.\n\nUsing USDC as an example (although this holds true for all major stablecoins), we can see that the increase in total circulating supply outstrips the growth in the supply locked in smart contracts, meaning that the freely available supply of stablecoins is still increasing despite more of them being locked up.\n\nThis illustrates that not only is there growth in the DeFi world (which incentivizes the locking up of stablecoins), but there is still even further growth in the number of liquid stablecoins. In other words, the supply of stablecoins available to buy into volatile assets such as BTC and ETH continues to increase, even as DeFi takes up more of the total supply.\n\nThis trend is highly bullish, as it signifies growth (and continued growth potential) across both traditional crypto trading and novel forms of yield generation in crypto.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nWeekly Feature: Why 10x BTC is Entirely Possible\n\nLast week, our CTO, Rafael Schultze-Kraft, published a Twitter thread outlining why he is \"insanely bullish\" on BTC. Looking at some core on-chain metrics, he explains why \"we could see more than 10x BTC from here\".\n\nNote that this does not represent Glassnode's official stance, and is not financial advice - but it is a compelling analysis nonetheless.\n\n1/ Where are we in the #Bitcoin market cycle?\n\nA look at some of the most important on-chain market indicators.\n\nTLDR: Insanely bullish, most metrics are far from the top. If things develop anything like 2017, we could see more than 10x $BTC from here.\n\nA THREAD 👇 pic.twitter.com/d1jU0h5fxA\n\n— Rafael Schultze-Kraft (@n3ocortex) December 8, 2020\n\nThe thread covers important on-chain metrics such as MVRV, NUPL, and Reserve Risk, noting that their values are well below the points reached at previous market tops. This suggests that BTC has plenty of room to grow before becoming overvalued, supporting the narrative that the current bull market is still in its early stages.\n\nCheck out the full thread to dive deeper, and follow Glassnode on Twitter for more analyses like this one.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nFutures Liquidations (BTC, ETH) - Total Long Liquidations, Mean Long Liquidations, Total Short Liquidations, Mean Short Liquidations.\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

On-chain signals suggest that a further correction may be seen before bitcoin breaks above $20k sustainably.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nDec 8, 2020 • 5 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBTC had another successful week during Week 49, recovering from the previous week's slump and briefly overtaking its previous all-time high. On Tuesday, it set a new ATH of $19,857, but immediately dropped back down into the $18,000s before slowly rising again, ending the week at $19,050.\n\nFor the Bulls\n\nBitcoin's Reserve Risk is still low, suggesting that the bull market may just be getting started. Reserve Risk is used to assess the confidence of long-term holders relative to the price of BTC; when confidence is high and price is low, Reserve Risk is low, and there is an attractive risk/reward to invest.\n\nCurrently, BTC's Reserve Risk is still close to the green zone, indicating that there is high confidence in bitcoin at this price point. This metric is presently even lower than it was during the 2019 bull run, when BTC reached $13k. The fact that it is still so low - even as bitcoin fluctuates around all-time highs - indicates an attractive risk/reward ratio for investing in BTC at this price.\n\nFor the Bears\n\nDespite the high confidence in BTC demonstrated by its Reserve Risk value, the number of Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) has been gradually increasing. This generally indicates that older coins are moving, meaning that longer-term holders are selling off some of their BTC and realizing profits.\n\nThis sell pressure generated by longer-term holders is currently depressing BTC's price, keeping it from breaking out above $20k. While so many long-term holders remain in a state of significant profit, sideways or downwards price movement can be expected as they realize these profits.\n\nHowever, while high CDD may suggest that longer-term holders are taking profits, the global top is likely not here yet. Historically, CDD increases during bull runs, but usually peaks before the top. As such, although long-term holders may be selling at current prices (and creating downward price pressure), historical trends suggest that buy pressure will more than make up for this activity in the longer term.\n\nA Comment from Willy Woo\n\nWoo's Take: While on-chain signals for BTC are long-term bullish, investors can anticipate a correction in the coming weeks.\n\nFor bullish runs driven by organic investments, SOPR is a useful on-chain metric to signal when a pull back has finished correcting. SOPR measures the profit made by outgoing investors as they offload their coins. Typically SOPR needs to reset to zero before a correction is complete, that’s because investors in a bull market do not like selling at a loss, they’d rather HODL thereby alleviating the sell pressure allowing the bullish to continue.\n\nThe chart above shows just how far SOPR needs to retrace until a reset is complete. I’ve marked the corresponding region in the last bull cycle when Bitcoin tested all time highs. In that extremely fast rejection, SOPR took only 7 days to retrace, this one is likely to take longer given the nature of the month long run up, maybe 2-4 more weeks.\n\nRead more from Willy Woo in his newsletter, The Bitcoin Forecast.\n\nAltcoin Feature: PICKLE Tokens are being Withdrawn from Smart Contracts\n\nThe number of PICKLE tokens being held in smart contracts has been steadily and rapidly decreasing over the past week. The percentage of locked PICKLE has dropped from 82.6% down to 55.4% since 2 December.\n\nThis decrease is likely due to the fact that Pickle is no longer distributing token rewards to stakers since the Pickle protocol was hacked on 22 November. However, this number will likely increase again soon when Yearn introduces Pickle vaults.\n\nUnder this new model, PICKLE holders will be able to stake their tokens to earn DILL tokens, which can be used to participate in governance votes as well as boosting Yearn vault rewards. In the meantime, however, investors should be aware that the presence of more liquid PICKLE tokens in circulation may have an impact on price.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain?

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 48, 2020)\n\nAfter a rather tumultuous week, BTC and the rest of the crypto market appear to be recovering, with bitcoin rallying to break its all-time high and quickly approaching $20,000.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nNov 30, 2020 • 6 min read\nA New Week On-Chain\n\nWe're changing up The Week On-Chain to place even more of a focus on the fundamentals offered by on-chain data. This new format will include more of what our readers love most, while keeping the core information that provides actionable market insights about BTC and other popular cryptoassets! If you miss the old format, or have any other feedback on our new format, let us know on Twitter!\n\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin, along with the rest of the crypto market, had a tumultuous week. After starting the week at over $18,600 and subsequently rising above $19k, BTC dropped sharply on Thursday, finding support at $16,500 and slowly increasing to end the week at $18,145.\n\nAs of Monday, however, BTC is quickly approaching $20k, and even briefly broke its all-time high of $19,783.\n\nFor the Bulls\n\nThe Number of Active Entities (Tier 3) on the Bitcoin blockchain has steadily increased throughout 2020, and is now approaching 400,000 active entities per day - less than 4% short of its previous all-time high. It has only been higher than the current level at one point in time, during the bull market in late 2017.\n\nThis heightened on-chain activity signifies increased adoption and usage of the network. However, unlike the last bull market, the Number of New Entities (Tier 3) is still comparatively low.\n\nThis indicates that the current rally may be more driven by institutional investors, rather than retail. As such, it is possible that we can expect more growth in terms of adoption and price before retail investors start to enter the market.\n\nFor the Bears\n\nCountering this bullish perspective is Entity-Adjusted ASOL (Tier 3), which shows that the average age of coins being transacted is rapidly increasing. A higher value means that in general, older coins are being moved, which may signify longer-term holders realizing profits.\n\nOn November 28, the average age of coins transacted was 43.9 days. The last time Entity-Adjusted ASOL was this high was in January 2018, when longer-term holders sold off BTC as it fell from its all-time high. The recent spike indicates that longer-term holders are realizing profits made over the past few years, an analysis which is supported by an increase in Coin Days Destroyed (Tier 2) and LTH-SOPR (Tier 3).\n\nHowever, this pattern differs from the 2017 bull market in that the spike in ASOL is occurring while the price is still increasing, as opposed to after a top. It does not necessarily represent a sell-off (or a response to one, as we saw in 2018), but it does suggest that long-term holders may have doubts about the potential for sustained price movement above ATH as early as this year.\n\nA Bullish Comment from Willy Woo\n\nThe re-accumulation phase of this bull market has coincided with the longest and deepest depletion of BTC inventory from spot exchanges in bitcoin’s 12 year history.\n\nThis depletion has lasted 10 months thus far, doubling last cycle’s 5 month span. Similarly, the volume of coins scooped off exchanges and into cold storage reflects 19% of inventory vs. 11% in the last cycle. With this in mind, 2021 is expected to be wildly bullish.\n\nWhile the market may need to cool down locally after a strong November rally, the longer-range market structure is extremely bullish. Consider the coming weeks the last dip-buying opportunity before Bitcoin breaks above its all time high and begins its price discovery phase above $20k.\n\nOnce past $20k, there will be no historical resistance levels to contend with, allowing for the price discovery mechanism to launch the price upwards at an increased rate. Investors should consider fully deploying capital before the all time high.\n\nRead more from Willy Woo in his newsletter, The Bitcoin Forecast (current Black Friday discount).\n\nAltcoin Feature: End of UNI Staking Causes Supply of WBTC in Smart Contracts to Drop\n\nBetween 17 September and 17 November, Uniswap offered the opportunity to farm UNI tokens by providing liquidity to any of four ETH-based liquidity pools. The largest of these pools was ETH/WBTC, which attracted over $800 million of liquidity at its peak.\n\nThis led to a large number of ETH and WBTC being locked in smart contracts as users farmed UNI tokens. But on the day that farming ended, both of these assets saw a decrease in the percentage of their supply being locked up (Tier 2) - a drop which was especially large for WBTC.\n\nETH saw a 0.8 point decrease when UNI farming ended on 17 November, while WBTC, which naturally has less use cases than Ethereum's native asset, saw a massive 10 point drop as users withdrew their liquidity from Uniswap. This, in turn, led to a $1.3 billion drop in total liquidity on Uniswap - a decrease of over 42% from the previous day.\n\nLiquidity on Uniswap dropped by $1.3 billion when farming ended (source: uniswap.info)\n\nThe other assets which were supported for UNI liquidity farming (DAI, USDC, and USDT) saw smaller - but still notable - decreases in comparison with WBTC (3.95, 1.45, and 0.63 points, respectively).\n\nNotably, despite over $1 billion worth of ETH being locked up in these pools, the price of ETH was not impacted by the return of these coins to the market, suggesting that their owners continued to hold them even after staking ended.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain?

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 47, 2020)\n\nWith prices exceeding $18,000 for the first time since 2017, BTC looks poised to break its previous all-time high. Meanwhile, plummeting exchange balances support the narrative that investors intend to hodl.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nNov 23, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBTC had another impressive week, rising above $18,000 for the first time since December 2017 and coming close to reaching a new all-time high. Starting the week at $15,930, it quickly rose above $17k and then $18k, finishing off Week 47 at a price of over $18,600.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals experienced strong gains throughout Week 47. GNI rose by 6 points, reaching a score of 67 points, with all three major subindices experiencing growth.\n\nNetwork Health saw an 11 point increase throughout the week, ending at a score of 67 points. The network activity subcategory performed particularly well, growing by 13 points due to an increase in the number of active entities and the on-chain transaction rate.\n\nLiquidity rose by 2 points, reaching a final score of 56 points for the week. While trading liquidity decreased due to BTC being continually withdrawn from exchanges, transaction liquidity grew as the number of on-chain transactions increased.\n\nSentiment ended the week at 68 points, representing a 6 point increase. The saving behavior subcategory made the largest contribution to this growth, increasing by 24 points (140%) as BTC hodlers slowed the rate at which they were selling.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nThe compass shot high into the bullish quadrant over the past week, seeing impressive gains in terms of both GNI and price trend.\n\nIts firm position in the bullish Regime 1 is bolstered by strong on-chain fundamentals, continued growth in terms of adoption, and impressive price gains over the past few weeks.\n\nIn addition, BTC has continued to significantly outperformed the stock market, growing by almost 17% over the past week in comparison with last week's 2% drop in the SPY index. This supports narratives around a potential decoupling, which - if it can be maintained - removes stock prices as an upper bound for bitcoin's growth.\n\nAltcoin Digest\nPerformance against BTC\n\nAside from BNB, the top altcoins all performed well against BTC throughout Week 47. XRP saw the largest gains, growing by almost 50% next to bitcoin.\n\nBNB continues to perform poorly in comparison with other altcoins, dropping down to 10th place in terms of market cap while the rest of the market thrives.\n\nPerformance against USD\n\nIn USD terms, all of the top altcoins saw gains over the past week - even including BNB, despite its losses in relation to bitcoin. XRP gained an impressive 73.9% over the week.\n\nLTC has also made its way back into the top 10 over the past couple of months, now sitting at 6th place after languishing at number 12 just eight weeks ago.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nBTC Exchange Liquidity Continues on its Downward Trajectory\n\nThe number of BTC on exchanges has been on a near-continuous downward trend since the beginning of 2020, dropping by nearly 20% throughout the year. Since October, the withdrawal of bitcoin from exchanges has become even more rapid as BTC's price has increased more steeply.\n\nThis represents a stark difference from the 2017 bull run, during which exchange balances rose rapidly. In general, withdrawals from exchanges indicate that investors intend to hold BTC, rather than planning on selling it in the near future. In contrast, less committed retail investors tend to leave their BTC on exchanges, ready to be liquidated.\n\nAs such, many believe that this trend means more investors are committed to holding for the long term, as opposed to being retail investors cashing in on the hype. The withdrawal of BTC from exchanges is therefore a bullish sign for bitcoin, suggesting that investors believe the asset has more room to grow despite approaching a new all-time high.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nRelative Long/Short-Term Holder Supply (BTC) - New metric showing the relative amount of circulating supply of held by long- and short-term holders in profit/loss.\nLong-Term Holder Metrics (BTC) - Long-Term Holder Supply, Position Change, Supply in Profit, Supply in Loss.\nShort-Term Holder Metrics (BTC) - Short-Term Holder Supply, Supply in Profit, Supply in Loss.\nNew Exchanges Added for Futures Metrics (BTC) - Bybit, FTX, Huobi, Kraken, OKEx.\nFeatures\nCustom Dashboards - Personalized dashboards are now live on Glassnode Studio!

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 46, 2020)\n\nBTC saw continued gains throughout Week 46, rising above $16k for the first time since January 2018. Meanwhile, Ethereum looks poised to launch the first stage of ETH2.0 before the end of 2020.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nNov 16, 2020 • 5 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin experienced another week of price gains during Week 46, starting the week at $15,500 and ending it at $15,940. On Thursday, it rose above $16,000 for the first time since January 2018. Although it dipped below this point later in the week, as of today, BTC is back above $16k once again.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals saw a small drop over Week 46. GNI lost 1 point, dropping to a score of 61 points. This was caused by decreases in the Liquidity and Sentiment subindices, while Network Health increased.\n\nNetwork Health gained 5 points, ending the week at a score of 67 points. Both the network growth and network activity subcategories saw decent gains as a result of an increase in on-chain transactions and new entities joining the network.\n\nLiquidity lost 5 points throughout the week, giving it a score of 54. Transaction liquidity dropped slightly, but trading liquidity saw even larger losses. This decrease was caused by a decline in the number of BTC being deposited onto exchanges, as well as a drop in the supply of stablecoins relative to the supply of BTC.\n\nSentiment saw a 4 point decrease, ending Week 46 at a score of 62 points. The investor sentiment subcategory was responsible for this decrease, dropping mostly as a result of a decline in STH-SOPR. In other words, short-term traders are selling BTC at a lower profit margin on average.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nAs BTC continues to show bullish signs, the compass remains in Regime 1 for yet another week, signalling continued positive sentiment.\n\nWhile GNI dropped by one point over the past week, bitcoin's price trend increased to a value of 16% after it rose to exceed $16,000 for the first time since the last major crypto bull market.\n\nBTC's continued price increases have pushed it further and further from trends in the stock market, lending even more credence to narratives that suggest a potential decoupling from traditional markets.\n\nSome are also circulating a narrative that BTC could decouple from the rest of the cryptocurrency market. However, this seems less likely, and is not supported by historical trends. In the past, increases in BTC have been followed by increases in ETH and other major altcoins, followed by smaller altcoins and DeFi. As such, while crypto markets may be decoupling from the stock market, BTC likely won't decouple from the rest of crypto at this stage.\n\nAltcoin Digest\nPerformance against BTC\n\nThe top altcoins mostly performed poorly in comparison with bitcoin throughout Week 46, with the exception of XRP, which gained 2.8% against BTC.\n\nIn the midst of announcements about a hard fork, BCH lost 12.9% of its value in BTC terms throughout the week.\n\nPerformance against USD\n\nNot only did most of the top altcoins lose value against BTC over the week, but they also lost USD value (once again with the exception of XRP).\n\nWhile ETH only dropped by 1.5%, BCH lost a massive 10.5% of its USD value following its fork into two chains (BCHA and BCHN).\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nEthereum is 18% of the Way To Launching ETH2.0 Phase 0\n\nWhile BTC sees continued support at higher and higher prices, the rest of the crypto ecosystem is also continuing to develop. One of the major developments is with Ethereum, which will see ETH2.0 Phase 0 launching soon.\n\nThe first stage of ETH2.0 - the \"Beacon Chain\" - will launch on December 1st, provided that at least 524,288 ETH are staked in the deposit contract before this date.\n\nCurrently, almost 3000 validators have staked a total of 95,552 ETH in the ETH2.0 contract address. This means that the Ethereum network is over 18% of the way towards reaching the threshold required to launch Phase 0.\n\nWhen Phase 0 initially launches, little will change for Ethereum. The Beacon Chain doesn't have accounts and can't handle smart contracts; rather, it is simply the first stage in moving Ethereum from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus model. Once Phase 0 launches, the original PoW Ethereum chain will continue functioning as per normal.\n\nThis interim period will give the Beacon Chain the opportunity to undergo testing in a live environment. In the future, Ethereum shard chains (Phase 1) will be launched, and eventually the two blockchains will merge, at which point the Beacon Chain will enable PoS mining and be responsible for assigning stakers as validators for shard chains.\n\nEven accounting for this gradual launch process, the prospect of faster processing times and cheaper transactions is promising for the price of ETH, as it gives the Ethereum network the opportunity to capture even more of the economic activity in the crypto sphere.\n\nTo stay updated on the progress toward Phase 0, check out our ETH2.0 metrics on Glassnode Studio.\n\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel jetzt auf Deutsch bei unserem offiziellen Partner Bitcoin2Go\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 45, 2020)\n\nBTC has continued its impressive streak, hitting $15k over the past week and showing few signs of slowing down. On-chain metrics suggest that it has more room to grow before reaching the next top.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nNov 9, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin had yet another impressive week, starting Week 45 at $13,690 and ending it at $15,500. This represents a 13.2% increase, and marks BTC's first time venturing over $15k since January 2018, almost 3 years ago.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals rose slightly during Week 45, starting to make up for the previous week's losses. GNI gained 5 points to reach a score of 62 points. This increase was caused mostly by a rise in the Liquidity subindex, with Network Health also gaining some strength.\n\nNetwork Health rose by 3 points over the past week, reaching a score of 62 points. This was driven by an increase in the network growth subcategory as BTC saw more new addresses and entities.\n\nLiquidity gained 10 points, ending the week at a score of 59 points. Transaction liquidity performed particularly well, increasing by 11 points as the number of on-chain transactions and the total transfer volume of BTC on-chain increased.\n\nSentiment lost 2 points for Week 45, ending the week at a score of 66 points. The saving behavior subcategory was the main driver behind this decline, as hodlers continued to sell more than they were buying on average.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nThe compass once again sits firmly in the bullish Regime 1 for Week 45, marking an extremely strong week for BTC.\n\nThe continued price increases over the past week saw BTC exceed $15k for the first time since the early 2018 bull run, and this growth appears to be continuing, with strongly positive sentiment echoing throughout the community.\n\nIn the wake of the US election, the stock market has begun to rally - but BTC's growth has significantly outpaced this, putting more weight behind the possibility of a decoupling that we have been seeing over the past few weeks. If bitcoin's growth trajectory continues, it may be able to firmly decouple from traditional financial markets, opening it up for even further growth.\n\nAltcoin Digest\nPerformance against BTC\n\nMost of the top altcoins performed worse than BTC over Week 45, losing between 2.7% and 11.7% against the top cryptocurrency. One notable exception is ETH, which gained 1.2% against BTC for the week.\n\nThe worst performing top 10 altcoin was BNB, which lost 11.7% against bitcoin. In spite of this loss, however, it maintained its position at number 7 in terms of total market cap.\n\nPerformance against USD\n\nDespite mostly losing value against BTC, the top altcoins all increased in USD value over the past week. The most impressive performer was ETH, gaining 14.6% and exceeding $450 for the first time since July 2018.\n\nLINK also saw a comeback over the past week, gaining 10.1% and making its way above $12 once again. Meanwhile, BNB languished, gaining only a fraction of a percent in value.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nBitcoin's Unrealized Profit Indicates Room for Growth\n\nBitcoin's Relative Unrealized Profit shows the total profit of all coins in existence whose price at realization time (i.e. when they were last moved) was lower than the current price, normalized by market cap.\n\nThis metric's current value is still low relative to previous tops, indicating more room for growth in bitcoin's price.\n\nPrevious global tops for this metric were hit at around 0.8, and last year's local top of $13k was hit at a value of 0.64. At the current price of over $15k, the level of relative unrealized profit is only 0.56.\n\nThese values suggest that BTC holders will wait to sell until we see significant further price increases, thus implying more room for BTC to grow before we see the next top.\n\nLesen Sie diesen Artikel auf Deutsch\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

But despite these gains, a drop in on-chain fundamentals may prevent bitcoin from decoupling from traditional markets.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nNov 2, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin had yet another impressive week, starting at $13,020 and finishing up the week at $13,690. It dropped below $13,000 a few times throughout Week 44, but continually recovered from these dips, rising by 5.2% overall and regaining more of the total crypto market share.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals decreased over Week 44, despite BTC's price gains. GNI lost 9 points, taking it to a score of 57 points. All of the subindices decreased, but the drop came mostly from Network Health and Liquidity, while Sentiment stayed relatively stable.\n\nNetwork Health lost 12 points over the past week, taking it to a score of 59 points. The decrease was partially caused by the network growth subcategory, but the larger loss was the result of a decrease in network activity, which lost 17 points due to a drop in the on-chain transaction rate and the number of active addresses.\n\nLiquidity saw a 10 point decrease throughout Week 44, ending the week at 49 points. While trading liquidity increased, the transaction liquidity subcategory lost 14 points, due to decreases in the on-chain transaction count and velocity, and an increase in on-chain transaction fees.\n\nSentiment performed the best out of all 3 subindices, losing just 1 point and ending the week at a score of 68 points. While investor sentiment increased, the saving behavior subcategory saw a large 65 point drop. This was caused primarily by the Hodler Net Position Change metric dropping into the negatives, meaning that hodlers sold more than they bought over the week.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nDespite the past week's decrease in GNI, bitcoin stayed in the bullish Regime 1 for Week 44, now for the 23rd week in a row.\n\nAlthough bitcoin's on-chain fundamentals saw a drop over the Week 44, it is still seeing positive price performance. Last week, we discussed a possible decoupling of BTC from traditional markets, and the past week's price movements have supported the idea that this may be an emerging trend.\n\nWhile stock prices have continued decreasing, the price of BTC has kept increasing. If bitcoin can maintain this trajectory, it may be in for a bull run, with new all-time highs possibly in sight. However, the recent decrease in on-chain fundamentals may prevent BTC from breaking out at this stage.\n\nAltcoin Digest\nPerformance against BTC\n\nThe top altcoins all performed poorly next to BTC throughout Week 44. For the second week in a row, they lost value in BTC terms, with the biggest loser once again being BNB, at -10.6% next to bitcoin.\n\nMeanwhile, ETH, which saw some gains the previous week, lost 7.4% next to BTC over the past week.\n\nPerformance against USD\n\nAs well as losing value against BTC, the top altcoins all decreased in USD value over the past week. Of the top cryptoassets, BTC was the only one to end the week in the green.\n\nAfter losing 1.7% the previous week, BNB lost yet another 6% over the past week. BCH was the least hard-hit altcoin, losing only 1.1% of its value and maintaining the number 5 spot.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nUSDC Approaching Supply of 3 Billion\n\nUSDC is an ERC-20 stablecoin that is 1:1 backed by regularly audited fiat USD reserves. The asset was launched in September 2018 by Circle, with support from the likes of Coinbase and Bitmain.\n\nUSDC grew slowly for the first year and a half of its existence, taking 21 months to attain a supply of 1 billion, which it reached in July 2020. However, after this milestone, the asset entered a rapid growth trajectory, taking only 2.5 months to double in supply and reach 2 billion.\n\nLess than 2 months later, it is now the second most popular stablecoin, with a supply of nearly 3 billion, making it the 12th most valuable cryptoasset by market cap.\n\nIts popularity is surpassed only by USDT (Tether), which has a supply of 16.7 billion, but a much shakier reputation. While USDT has also seen impressive growth in the latter half of 2020, there have been claims that it is not 1:1 backed, opening up the market for stablecoins like USDC to gain more popularity.\n\nWith this kind of growth, USDC will soon enter the coveted top 10, becoming one of the most valuable cryptoassets. Given the rise of stablecoin usage and its increasing popularity and reputation in comparison with USDT, it may even keep rising to become the most valuable stablecoin.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nAdjusted Circulating Supply (BTC) - New metric showing BTC's circulating supply, adjusted to account for lost coins.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 43, 2020)\n\nBitcoin saw some impressive gains over Week 43, surpassing $13,000 and staying confidently above that price point into this week. Its on-chain fundamentals remain strong, and it appears to be deviating from traditional financial market trends.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nOct 26, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin gained an impressive 13.7% over Week 43, starting the week at $11,450 and ending it at $13,020. After rising above $13k on Wednesday evening, BTC managed to retain support at this level, occasionally slipping down into the $12,000s but quickly rising back up.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals increased alongside the price of BTC throughout Week 43. GNI gained 5 points, rising to a score of 66 points from 61 the previous week. This increase was due to gains in the Network Health and Liquidity subindices, while Sentiment dropped slightly.\n\nNetwork Health gained 4 points over the week, ending at a score of 71 points. Both the network growth and network activity subcategories saw gains, thanks to an increase in the number of active entities, new entities, and the transaction rate on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nLiquidity saw an 8 point increase, ending the week at 59 points. Trading liquidity decreased by 4 points due to a decrease in exchange inflows, but transaction liquidity increased by an impressive 12 points, benefitting from high on-chain transfer volumes throughout the week.\n\nSentiment dropped by 1 point, taking it to a score of 69 points for Week 43. While saving behavior saw an increase, the investor sentiment subcategory decreased slightly, negating these gains.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nOnce again, the compass remains in the bullish Regime 1 for Week 43 of this year. Now its 22nd consecutive week in the green zone, this indicates strong on-chain fundamentals and a positive price trend for BTC.\n\nThe past week's price increase coincided with an increase in stock prices, but whereas stocks have increased by only a small amount, the price of BTC spiked significantly. This represents bitcoin's largest deviation from the stock market since July this year.\n\nBTC deviated from the SPY price trend in July this year before returning to a close correlation - but now appears to be deviating once again (source: TradingView)\n\nIn previous issues of this newsletter, we have discussed the potential for a decoupling from traditional financial markets - and while it is too early to tell whether the past week's deviation is indicative of a longer-term trend toward decoupling, it is a promising sign for BTC.\n\nAltcoin Digest\nPerformance against BTC\n\nWith BTC's impressive performance over Week 43, the top altcoins performed comparatively badly, with none of them beating bitcoin's gains.\n\nThe best performing top 10 altcoin was LINK, losing only 1.2% against BTC. Meanwhile, BNB lost 13.6% next to bitcoin, being the only top altcoin to also drop in USD value over the past week.\n\nPerformance against USD\n\nBNB lost 1.7% of its USD value over Week 43. Meanwhile, all other top 10 altcoins saw price gains, despite underperforming against BTC.\n\nLINK gained 12.3% in USD value, while ETH increased by 8%. The rise of BTC seems to have lifted the rest of the market, which increased in value by 7.9%, with BTC rising back up to claim over 60% of the total crypto market cap.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\n98% of Bitcoin UTXOs are in Profit\n\nWith bitcoin's latest run up to over $13,000, the portion of UTXOs in profit now stands at 98% - a value not seen since December 2017. This high value, typically seen during BTC bull runs, means that almost all UTXOs were created when the price was lower than it is currently.\n\nIf we generalize to assume that a UTXO represents a sale/purchase of BTC, this means that 98% of all BTC trades so far have been profitable.\n\nThe fact that BTC has stayed above $13k throughout the week implies that extreme sell pressure is not present at this price; most holders are not selling their BTC yet, despite being in profit, meaning that they likely anticipate further price gains.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nCumulative Value Days Destroyed (BTC) - New metric showing the ratio of the cumulative USD value of Coin Days Destroyed and the market age (in days). Historically, CVDD has been an accurate indicator for global Bitcoin market bottoms.\nFeatures\nComing Soon: Custom Dashboards - Keep an eye out for a new and improved dashboard experience on Glassnode Studio, coming soon!

Overall BTC remains largely stable, unable to break out without a decoupling from traditional financial markets.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nOct 19, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin saw a small increase during Week 42, ending the week at $11,450, 0.8% up from where it started at around $11,360. BTC reached a high of $11,660 on Monday evening before falling back down, and then slowly inclining toward the end of the week.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals dropped slightly during Week 42. GNI dropped back down to 61 points, a 2 point decrease from the previous week. This decrease was triggered by a decrease in the Liquidity and Network Health subindices, while Sentiment remained strong.\n\nNetwork Health lost 2 points from the previous week, ending at 67 points for Week 42. While the network growth subcategory increased slightly, network activity experienced a 6 point drop due to a decrease in active entities and the on-chain transaction rate.\n\nLiquidity ended the week at 51 points; a 5 point decrease. This was caused by a moderate drop in the transaction liquidity subcategory, which in turn resulted from a decrease in BTC's on-chain transaction count and transfer volumes.\n\nSentiment was the only subindex that saw an increase over the week, ending at 70 points. The investor sentiment subcategory rise by 5 points thanks to bitcoin's small price increase, which saw more addresses in profit, and less investors selling at a loss.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nThe compass stayed in the bullish Regime 1 for the 21st week in a row - meaning that it has now been in this zone consecutively for half of 2020.\n\nBitcoin's bullish on-chain fundamentals and price trend suggest that its continued support above $11,000 is stable. However, BTC is still closely tracking movements in the stock market, preventing it from seeing another breakout.\n\nA decoupling from traditional financial markets would still be necessary for BTC to see another period of extreme rapid growth.\n\nAltcoin Digest\nPerformance against BTC\n\nOver Week 42, the top altcoins once again saw mixed performance against bitcoin. ETH stayed on par with BTC, while BCH rose ahead by 3.5% and BNB by 6.3%.\n\nDOT lost value against BTC for the second week in a row, dropping by 4.4% and staying in its position as the 8th highest market cap cryptocurrency.\n\nPerformance against USD\n\nMeanwhile, most of the top altcoins saw small gains in their USD value over the week, with BNB rising by 7.1%. BTC also rose in price slightly, by 0.8%.\n\nXRP lost 4.9% of its USD value over the week, but started recovering on Monday morning.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nFilecoin Network Launches - But Mining Incentives May Be Misaligned\n\nOn 15 October, Filecoin launched its mainnet after over 3 years of development. FIL tokens from its presale started to vest, and miners started offering their storage services on the network.\n\nDespite the technical success of the launch, however, the network's token economics have proven to get in the way of mining. Filecoin miners have to buy and stake FIL tokens in order to provide storage services; the more storage they wish to provide, the more FIL they need to stake.\n\nBut the market price of FIL is prohibitively high in relation to the returns miners get from offering storage services. Not only that, but mining rewards vest over 180 days, meaning that miners have to account for significant overhead over a long period of time before they can expect to offer their services profitably.\n\nIn a tweet thread, Nico Deva outlined the issue in more detail:\n\n@filecoin has transitioned from calibration net to mainnet at block 148,888 after a 200M ICO and 3 years of dev.\n\nWithin 24h of launch a majority of miners are already on strike and talk about a failed wedding and forks.\n\nWhy? (1/n)\n\n— Nico Deva (@NicoDeva_) October 18, 2020\n\nWith these misaligned token economics, will miners be able to maintain their services long enough to become profitable? If not, can the Filecoin network survive? And what does this mean for the token price?\n\nStay tuned on Glassnode Insights for an in-depth analysis of the FIL token launch and the new network's potential pitfalls.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

After seeing growth on Thursday and Saturday, BTC found stable support above $11k for the first time since August.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals grew slightly over Week 41. GNI gained 2 points, climbing up to a score of 63. This was mostly due to a rise in the Sentiment subindex, which grew significantly, gaining 15 points from the previous week. Meanwhile, Liquidity decreased, preventing GNI from growing even higher.\n\nNetwork Health saw modest growth across the week, growing by 3 points to reach a score of 69. This rise was due to gains in both the network growth and network activity subcategories, as BTC saw growth in the number of new entities joining the network as well as the rate of on-chain transactions.\n\nLiquidity lost 5 points over the past week, taking it to a score of 56. The transaction liquidity subcategory remained static, but trading liquidity lost 19 points as a result of dropping exchange inflows, as well as a decrease in the number of stablecoins relative to BTC supply.\n\nSentiment was the winner of the week, gaining 15 points and reaching a score of 66. The largest increase was in the investor sentiment subcategory, which gained 24 points as the BTC price rose and the supply of BTC in profit increased, along with MVRV and SOPR.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nFor what is now the 20th consecutive week, the compass remains in the bullish Regime 1. If it can stay in the green zone for one more week, this will represent half of the year so far during which the compass has remained in this zone non-stop.\n\nAs usual, the rise in BTC's price over the past week tracked increases in the stock market, yet again confirming bitcoin's correlation with traditional financial markets. This growth was seen across the whole crypto market, which saw some recovery last week after dropping the previous week.\n\nMeanwhile, bitcoin's on-chain fundamentals grew stronger over Week 41, with GNI reaching its 11th highest score for 2020. As we have previously reported, if BTC can shake its strong correlation with the stock market, it is well-positioned for a breakout.\n\nAltcoin Digest\nPerformance against BTC\n\nThe top altcoins saw mixed performance against BTC for Week 41. As is a common pattern, blockchain protocol coins (such as ETH and BCH) experienced less variation, while utility tokens (such as BNB and LINK) fluctuated more widely.\n\nLINK and BNB reversed the previous week's trend; this past week, LINK gained 6.5%, while BNB lost 7.7% against bitcoin.\n\nPerformance against USD\n\nAll of the top altcoins aside from BNB saw growth against USD over the past week, especially toward the end of the week. LINK was the best performer, gaining 13.6% and overtaking DOT to regain the position of 7th most valuable cryptoasset. Meanwhile, BCH overtook BNB, putting it back in 5th place and pushing BNB back down to 6th.\n\nDespite BTC's 6.6% growth, its market share actually dropped slightly over the week as other cryptoassets recovered from the previous week's losses.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nGrowth in the Number of BTC Whales is Slowing\n\nThroughout 2020, the number of BTC whales (entities holding at least 1000 BTC) has been growing consistently, showing trends similar to 2012 and 2014-15. However, since early September, the number of whales has actually started decreasing - the first decline since late 2019.\n\nHistorically, the start of a decline in the number of BTC whales has often signified increased interest from retail investors and the beginning of a run up to a market top. This trend runs contrary to popular sentiment which says that sell pressure from whales drives the price down.\n\nWhile the current decline is slow, and still in its early stages, it may signify the beginning of another bull run. Investors should keep a close eye on this metric on Glassnode Studio to see whether BTC's price will follow historical trends associated with a decrease in whale numbers.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 40, 2020)\n\nDespite a number of potentially unsettling events over the past week, BTC has remained largely stable at over $10,000, and its on-chain fundamentals are still strong.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nOct 5, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBTC lost a small percentage of its value over Week 40, starting the week at a price of around $10,730 and ending it at $10,650. The price dropped sharply on Thursday, reaching a low of $10,450, but it gradually recovered throughout the remainder of the week.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals recovered slightly during Week 40 after dipping the previous week. GNI gained 4 points, taking it to a score of 61, with all three subindices seeing positive growth throughout the week.\n\nNetwork Health gained 2 points over the week, bringing it to a strong score of 66 points. The network growth subcategory saw modest gains as a result of a rise in the number of new entities joining the Bitcoin network. The network activity score also rose as the number of active entities grew.\n\nLiquidity reached a score of 61 points, gaining 5 points from the previous week. This was mostly due to an increase in transaction liquidity, driven by slightly higher on-chain trading volumes and a small rise in velocity.\n\nSentiment performed the best of all three subindices for Week 40, gaining 6 points to bring it to a score of 41. The saving behavior subcategory performed particularly well, shooting up to a score of 100 as hodlers started acquiring BTC at a faster rate.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nNow for the 19th week in a row, the bitcoin compass remains in Regime 1 - the bullish green zone. It has now been in this position continuously for almost half of the year so far.\n\nThis high compass score shows that bitcoin's fundamentals remain strong, and on-chain activity is healthy. A BTC price above $10k has found consistent support within the market, with the asset quickly recovering from its only recent drop below this point on 8 September 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, the price of BTC is still closely tracking the stock market, with Thursday's price drop coinciding with a drop in stock market futures. Last week, we covered the reasons behind this correlation, and the driving forces necessary to initiate a decoupling. For the time being, however, BTC's price (and therefore the price of other cryptoassets) seems tied to the rest of the world's financial markets.\n\nInvestors should remain cognizant that, with the recent news of Trump's Covid-19 diagnosis and the uncertainty this brings, the near-term outlook for stocks is unclear. As such, short-term traders should keep a close eye on how this situation evolves in order to capitalize on volatility. Meanwhile, long-term hodlers can remain confident in the strength of bitcoin's underlying fundamentals, while simultaneously looking out for good buying opportunities in the coming days and weeks.\n\nAltcoin Digest\nPerformance against BTC\n\nThe top altcoins saw mixed performance against BTC over the past week. ETH, XRP, and BNB all gained value against the top cryptoasset, while DOT, BCH, and LINK all slipped in value.\n\nBNB was the biggest winner of the week, gaining 12.9% against bitcoin and retaining its spot at the 5th most valuable cryptoasset, with a market cap of over $4.1 billion.\n\nPerformance against USD\n\nThroughout the week, BTC barely moved against USD, dropping in price by only 0.7%. Major protocol tokens like ETH, BCH, and DOT all stayed relatively stable, while the top utility tokens saw larger movements.\n\nContinuing on its volatile path, LINK dropped by 12.4% over the week, after gaining 9.6% the previous week. Since falling from its all-time high of $19.85, its price has continued to fluctuate between $8 and $10.50 over the past month.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nFunds Flow from BitMEX Following CFTC Charges\n\nLast week, on Thursday 1 October, the popular exchange BitMEX, and a number of associated individuals, were charged by the CFTC for attempting to evade US regulations while operating an unregistered trading platform.\n\nOn Friday 2 October, the day after the announcement, BitMEX saw its largest ever day of net outflows as investors rushed to remove their funds from the now-risky platform.\n\nOverall, since the announcement, almost 45,000 BTC have been withdrawn from the exchange, representing a 27% drop in the total balance of BTC on BitMEX.\n\nAt the same time, BTC open interest in perpetual futures contracts on BitMEX saw a significant decline as well, decreasing by almost 24% from $590M to $450M – levels not seen since May 2020. However, the market appears to be mostly unfazed, and bitcoin futures remain popular on other exchanges despite this setback.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nMean Transfer Volume To/From Exchanges (BTC, ETH, ERC-20) - New metrics showing the mean exchange inflow and outflow of a given asset.\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 39, 2020)\n\nBTC has mostly recovered after dropping rapidly on Monday in response to the stock market. While its fundamentals remain strong, its correlation with traditional markets is limiting price growth.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nSep 28, 2020 • 5 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin started Week 39 at a price of $10,895, but dropped rapidly on Monday morning - along with the rest of the crypto market - in response to a decline in stock prices. However, it recovered later in the week, ending at a price of $10,740.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals decreased slightly during Week 39. GNI lost 3 points, ending the week at a score of 57. The main reason for this drop was a decline in the Network Health subindex, which lost 10 points over the week, while Liquidity and Sentiment both saw modest gains.\n\nNetwork Health dropped from a score of 74 to 64 points over Week 39, decreasing by 13.5%. The network growth subcategory lost 8 points due to a decline in the number of new users joining the Bitcoin network. Meanwhile, network activity dropped by 10 points as the number of BTC transactions also fell.\n\nLiquidity increased slightly throughout the week, gaining 1 point and re-entering the strong zone at 56 points. While trading liquidity decreased due to lower exchange deposits, transaction liquidity rose due to an increase in the volume of BTC transferred on-chain.\n\nSentiment saw a 2 point increase for Week 39, bringing it to a total of 45 points. This was driven by a rise in the investor sentiment subcategory, which itself rose due to an increase in bitcoin's MVRV ratio and STH-SOPR. In other words, on average, short-term BTC holders sold at a profit toward the end of the week, whereas at the beginning of the week they were selling at a loss.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nYet again, the bitcoin compass stayed in the bullish Regime 1, marking its 18th consecutive week in the green zone and indicating healthy fundamentals despite the languishing price of BTC.\n\nBitcoin's recovery after the rapid price drop last Monday tracked the performance of the S&P 500 and other major stock market indices, which also recovered after dropping on Monday.\n\nAs we have mentioned in previous issues of this newsletter, BTC and other cryptoassets have seen continued correlation with stocks throughout 2020, with Week 39 following this same trend once again.\n\nThe performance of BTC (red) and the S&P 500 (blue) throughout 2020 shows a strong correlation (source: TradingView)\n\nThis correlation can be explained by BTC's increasing popularity among \"traditional\" investors, including large-scale institutions. Bitcoin's trend toward becoming a more mainstream asset partially explains its failure to sustainably break out above $11,000 despite strong on-chain fundamentals.\n\nHowever, as demand from the traditional financial world continues to grow, BTC's limited supply should act in its favor, driving the price gradually higher.\n\nAltcoin Digest\nPerformance against BTC\n\nThe top altcoins saw mixed performance against BTC throughout Week 39. LINK moved ahead by 11.1% after losing significant value during the previous couple of weeks. BNB also gained value next to BTC, pushing it to the the rank of the 6th most valuable cryptoasset.\n\nMeanwhile, DOT lost 6.2% of its value next to BTC, and ETH lost 3.3%, recovering from Monday's drop more slowly than bitcoin.\n\nPerformance against USD\n\nDespite last Monday's sudden dip, the top coins didn't perform too badly for the week, mostly recovering from the drop. Unfortunately for Litecoin, the rise of BNB, ADA and BSV pushed LTC into 12th place, removing it from our weekly chart.\n\nSimilarly, DOT slipped significantly in the rankings, losing 7.5% of its value and dropping from its earlier position of 5th/6th down to 8th. At the same time, BNB overtook LINK to become the 6th most valuable cryptoasset.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nActive Entities on Bitcoin Network Poised to Reach All-Time High\n\nThe number of Active Entities on the Bitcoin network has steadily increased since its drop-off after the 2017/2018 bull market, and looks poised to overtake its previous all-time high in the near future.\n\nBitcoin's 90-day moving average of Active Entities has already overtaken its previous ATH, signaling a trend toward increasing adoption.\n\nAs BTC sees sustained growth in adoption, its limited supply should place upward pressure on price. According to on-chain analyst Willy Woo, this organic growth will also be the driving force behind an eventual decoupling of BTC from the stock markets. If and when this decoupling occurs, bitcoin's strong on-chain fundamentals and large community of dedicated HODLers will finally be reflected in its price.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nNumber of Addresses Depositing to Exchanges (BTC, ETH, ERC-20) - The number of unique addresses that appeared as a sender in a transaction sending funds to exchanges.\nNumber of Addresses Withdrawing from Exchanges (BTC, ETH, ERC-20) - The number of unique addresses that appeared as a receiver in a transaction receiving funds from an exchanges.\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

BTC briefly moved above $11k on Wednesday and Saturday, but failed to find support at this level, falling back down into the high $10,000s. As of Monday morning, however, BTC has fallen to $10,450 as crypto markets drop along with the stock market.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals increased over Week 38 after losing ground the previous week. GNI saw a 5 point increase, taking it back up to a score of 60 points. This increase was due to gains across all three subindices: Network Health, Liquidity, and Sentiment.\n\nNetwork Health gained 9 points during Week 38, ending up at 74 points. Network growth saw a 16% increase as more bitcoin addresses were created, while network activity also grew due to a rise in the number of on-chain BTC transactions.\n\nLiquidity saw a 2 point increase over the week, bringing it to a score of 55 points. Both the trading liquidity and transaction liquidity subcategories saw modest increases as a result of an increase in stablecoin supply and on-chain transaction count.\n\nSentiment increased by 4 points, due to spikes in both the investor sentiment and saving behavior subcategories. Investor sentiment rose due to the slight BTC price increase throughout the week, which saw more UTXOs move into a profitable state. Meanwhile, the rate at which hodlers acquired BTC also increased, bumping up the saving behavior subcategory.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nThe compass moved further into safer territory during Week 38, seeing increases in both GNI and price trend. This represents the 17th consecutive week that BTC remains in the bullish Regime 1 quadrant.\n\nHowever, while BTC performed well during Week 38, Monday morning's events threaten to pull the price back down. This morning, Bitcoin fell to $10,450, seeing large losses along with the rest of the crypto market. This drop was almost certainly caused by a sharp drop in stock market futures.\n\nThroughout 2020, we have consistently seen a strong correlation between crypto markets and traditional financial markets, and the crypto market's response to the 2.2% drop in Dow Jones futures this morning has reaffirmed this correlation.\n\nAs such, while the BTC price does appear to be stabilizing later into the day, investors should keep an eye on stock market movements to see whether they should prepare for a further drop in prices.\n\nAltcoin Digest\nPerformance against BTC\n\nIn Week 38, BTC saw strong performance against the rest of the crypto market; every major altcoin lost value next to BTC over the week. In its continued slide, LINK lost 22.7% of its value against BTC, while ETH fared better at only -3.9%.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin SV has slipped out of the top 10 altcoins thanks to the release of DOT and the increase in value of Crypto.com coin (CRO).\n\nPerformance against USD\n\nThe top coins had mixed performance against USD over the past week. BCH, XRP, and BCH all increased slightly in dollar value, while LTC, DOT, and LINK lost value.\n\nBTC gained ground once again, increasing its market dominance back to 58.3%, up from 56.6% the previous week.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter.\n\nETH Continues to Flow Out of Centralized Exchanges and Into Smart Contracts\n\nAs innovation in DeFi continues at a rapid pace, more and more ETH are flowing out of exchanges and into smart contracts.\n\nSince 15 August, the balance of ETH on centralized exchanges has decreased by 11.6%, with 2.2 million ETH being withdrawn on net. Meanwhile, the amount of ETH in smart contracts has increased by 3.4 million ETH.\n\nThis means that not only is ETH being withdrawn from exchanges and moved into the DeFi ecosystem, but it is also moving from private wallets into smart contracts. Right now, the DeFi ecosystem has 8 million ETH locked up, in comparison with the 16.6 million ETH on centralized exchanges - and this figure is continually growing.\n\nAt the same time, ETH volume on centralized exchanges is stagnating while DEX volumes continue to increase as the ecosystem matures and moves increasingly toward on-chain transactions.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 37, 2020)\n\nBitcoin's on-chain fundamentals are slipping slowly as its price stagnates around $10k. Meanwhile, activity within the Ethereum ecosystem is continually picking up.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nSep 14, 2020 • 5 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin had yet another stable week throughout Week 37, starting out on Monday morning at $10,340 and ending at the same value. Throughout the week, it fluctuated in a range of about $600, but stayed mostly consistent.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals decreased yet again throughout Week 37. GNI lost another 5 points, taking it down to a score of 55. The Network Health and Liquidity subindices both lost 9 points, while Sentiment slowed the decline, gaining 12 points.\n\nNetwork Health stayed in the strong zone with 65 points for Week 37, but still saw a significant 9 point decrease from the previous week. Network growth and network activity both took hits as on-chain transactions slowed down and fewer new users joined the network.\n\nLiquidity also lost 9 points, taking it into the neutral zone at a total of 53 points. While trading liquidity improved throughout the week, the transaction liquidity subcategory lost 13 points amidst the decrease in on-chain activity.\n\nSentiment slowed the decline in on-chain fundamentals by gaining 12 points over Week 37, reaching a score of 39. Both the investor sentiment and saving behavior subcategories increased. The rate at which hodlers have been acquiring BTC increased, likely due to lower prices, while bitcoin's stability above $10k likely contributed to positive sentiment, despite a lack of upward price movement.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nWeek 37 saw the bitcoin compass stay in Regime 1 for the 16th week in a row, marking four continued months of bullish fundamentals, both in terms of on-chain activity and price trends.\n\nWhile GNI decreased by 5 points over the week, bitcoin's price trend improved slightly, keeping the compass in the green zone. However, despite sustained strength in BTC's on-chain fundamentals, it has trended closer to the center of the compass over the past few weeks as the network begins to see some stagnation.\n\nMeanwhile, BTC is losing market dominance as DeFi protocols on Ethereum continue to see rapid growth. A similar trend played out in the bull run of early 2017, when money flowed into high-yield ICOs at a much faster rate than BTC. However, later in 2017, BTC started to regain dominance as ICO investors took profits and de-risked into a more reputable asset.\n\nThe question for this bull market is whether investors will move profits from high-yield DeFi tokens into BTC, or into another asset such as ETH or stablecoins. Many investors now talk of \"stacking wei\" as opposed to \"stacking sats\", signifying a potential shift in BTC's status as the default store of value within crypto markets.\n\nAs the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities increasingly diverge in their philosophy and demographics, BTC stands more of a chance of attracting investment from traditional hedge funds than the DeFi community.\n\nAltcoin Digest\nPerformance against BTC\n\nThroughout Week 37, the top altcoins mostly stayed within close range of BTC. The biggest gainer against bitcoin was ETH, up 2.4% for the week, while LINK lost 7.4% of its value next to BTC.\n\nLINK's performance over the past few weeks has taken it down from 5th to 8th place in terms of market cap, seeing it overtaken by BNB, DOT, and BCH.\n\nPerformance against USD\n\nBecause of bitcoin's stable price throughout the week, the top altcoins' performance against USD was about the same as against BTC.\n\nOnce again, ETH was the biggest winner, while LINK lost the most value of all major altcoins, dropping by 7.5%.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter, or enter our latest survey competition to have your say.\n\nOver 15% of ETH is Locked in Smart Contracts\n\nWith the rise of DeFi protocols - especially those which offer yield farming and liquidity mining - the utility of ETH has never been higher. Rather than passively holding, investors are locking up their ETH in all kinds of smart contracts in order to generate returns.\n\nAs a result, over 15% of all ETH is locked in smart contracts on Ethereum right now - up from 11.5% a year ago.\n\nOver 5% of ETH is locked up in the WETH (wrapped ether) smart contract, enabling it to interact with other tokens more easily. Most of this WETH has then been locked up in DeFi contracts, including Maker, Uniswap, and Balancer. Aside from DeFi use cases via WETH, the largest ETH balances in smart contracts are for exchange multisigs (e.g. Bitfinex and Gemini) and Compound's ETH pool.\n\nWhile exchange multisigs simply represent custodial passive holding, the other contracts (WETH, Compound, etc.) are all examples of how ETH is moving beyond the simple \"store of value\" use case.\n\nThe growing presence of ETH in these contracts represents its increasing utility - as a currency, a hedge, and a schelling point for liquidity provision.\n\nCompetition\nWin a free Advanced subscription to Glassnode Studio for a year\n\nWe want to make Glassnode Studio as useful and feature-rich as possible for our users.

Bitcoin started out the week at $11,622 and ended it at $10,343. It briefly dropped below the $10k mark on Saturday, but quickly recovered, finding resistance at this point and rising back above $10,100.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals stayed consistent in Week 36. GNI remained at 60 points, showing that fundamentals remain solid, despite the price decrease. The Liquidity subindex saw significant gains, while Sentiment experienced a large drop, likely due to price uncertainty.\n\nNetwork Health stayed at a healthy 74 points during Week 36. This subindex saw a 1 point increase in the network growth subcategory, while network activity dropped by 1 point. This was due to a small increase in new adoption, while on-chain activity slowed slightly.\n\nLiquidity increased significantly, gaining 14 points to take it to a score of 62 points overall. Trading liquidity saw a large uptick as BTC flowed onto exchanges, while transaction liquidity went up due to an increase in on-chain transactions from the beginning of the week.\n\nSentiment saw a large decrease during Week 36, dropping to 27 points from 52 the previous week. While saving behavior increased - likely due to hodlers acquiring more BTC at lower prices - overall investor sentiment decreased as the supply of BTC in profit went down.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nFor the 15th week in a row, the compass remained in Regime 1, indicating an overall bullish outlook. However, the downward price movement led to price performance decreasing.\n\nAs a result, BTC is inching closer to the transitional Regime 3, a zone which indicates strong on-chain fundamentals but a negative price trend. Further decreases in price over the coming week may take the compass out of the green zone for the first time in nearly 4 months.\n\nBitcoin has consistently shown correlation with traditional financial markets as it matures as an asset, and the downward performance of the S&P - and the stock market in general - threatens to bring BTC and other cryptoassets down as investors de-risk and turn to their crypto holdings for liquidity.\n\nIn the weeks to come, investors should be cognizant of movements in the stock market as a supplement to on-chain fundamentals in determining the expected behavior of BTC and crypto markets in general.\n\nAltcoin Digest\nPerformance against BTC\n\nDuring Week 36, all of the major altcoins lost value against BTC as the crypto market saw a downward correction.\n\nXRP held its ground most strongly, losing only 3% against BTC, while LINK lost 12.6% of its value next to bitcoin after gaining 11.1% the previous week.\n\nPerformance against USD\n\nWeek 36 saw significant losses for all major altcoins and bitcoin against USD. BTC fared the best, losing only 11.2% of its value, whereas LINK performed the worst, losing 22.2%.\n\nAs the market becomes more volatile, investors appear to be de-risking by moving from lower-cap alts back into more reliable assets such as BTC and ETH.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain?

Comparing the situation to when Charlie Lee sold his LTC, Chef Nomi claimed that this is not an exit scam, but rather that they sold in order to stop caring about price and instead focus on development.\n\nPeople asked if I exited scam. I did not. I am still here. I will continue to participate in the discussion. I will help with the technical part. I will help ensure we have a successful migration.@SatoshiLite did that and Litecoin had no problem surviving.\n\n— Chef Nomi #SushiSwap (@NomiChef) September 5, 2020\n\nWhether or not this is indeed an exit scam, Chef Nomi has indelibly damaged their reputation - and SushiSwap's chances of success - with this risky move.\n\nStay tuned on Glassnode Insights for further updates - and for the whole story on SushiSwap's rise to notoriety, read our full analysis.\n\nSushi vs. Unicorn: The Rise (And Fall?) of Uniswap\nUniswap has long been one of Ethereum’s favorite projects.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 35, 2020)\n\nAs the DeFi ecosystem continues to grow, BTC is losing market dominance. Despite largely healthy fundamentals, its growth potential seems unable to match the latest innovations in crypto.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nAug 31, 2020 • 6 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nThe $12k price level has eluded BTC for yet another week, with prices staying within a narrow $600 range between $11.2k and $11.8k. Bitcoin started Week 35 at $11,680 and ended the week at $11,640, neither gaining nor losing much ground against USD, but losing market dominance as altcoins (especially DeFi tokens) continue to surge.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals decreased for the second week in a row during Week 35. GNI lost 5 points, taking it down to a score of 60 points. This was due to decreases in the Network Health and Liquidity subindices, while Sentiment saw a small increase.\n\nNetwork Health lost 7 points over the past week, but remains healthy at a level of 74 points. The network growth and network activity subcategories both decreased by 6 points as a result of a slight decrease in on-chain activity and new adoption, but both still remain at overall strong levels.\n\nLiquidity also lost ground during Week 35, decreasing by 9 points and falling into the \"neutral\" zone at 48 points. Trading and transaction liquidity both dropped by 11 points due to a decrease in on-chain transactions and exchange balance. However, the balance of BTC on exchanges appears to be recovering slightly after a sharp drop early in Week 35.\n\nSentiment increased by 2 points last week due to a 26 point increase in saving behavior, taking the subindex to a score of 52 points. The increase was caused by an uptick in hodler net position change, indicating that the rate at which hodlers are acquiring BTC is accelerating.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nBitcoin has now been in the bullish Regime 1 for over 3 months (or 14 weeks), and remained in this quadrant for Week 35, indicating continued support at this level.\n\nHowever, despite generally strong fundamentals, BTC seems unable to gain ground in terms of price, even as the Ethereum-based DeFi ecosystem sees record levels of growth. This may be partially explained by the fact that the innovation network around DeFi means that there is a constant source of new and lucrative financial games to play, while BTC has seen little growth in terms of its value proposition or ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, BTC is no longer the sole on-ramp to crypto; many new speculators may be entering the market directly into ETH and/or DeFi rather than choosing BTC as their first (or even only) crypto investment, as occurred in the 2017 bull run.\n\nFinally, the crypto market has a long history of low-cap coins seeing multiple x gains over a short period of time - a phenomenon that bitcoin itself experienced in its earlier days. However, now that it has reached a formidable $200b+ market cap, that kind of rapid growth is less viable for BTC - but according to on-chain fundamentals, gradual and sustainable growth is still in the picture.\n\nAltcoin Digest\nPerformance against BTC\n\nDuring Week 35, a few of the top altcoins lost value against BTC, while others gained value. After falling by almost 20% the previous week, LINK gained 11.1% against BTC, while ETH also gained 7.8%. Meanwhile, bitcoin forks (BCH and BSV) and XRP lost value against BTC.\n\nOverall, alts performed well against BTC over Week 35, with bitcoin's market dominance dropping from 59.2% to 57.9%. Specifically, ERC-20 tokens appear to be performing well. We are seeing a trend of previously obscure low-cap ERC-20s emerging into the top 100, overtaking the market cap of native tokens for the Bitcoin and Ethereum competitors which dominated the leaderboard a few years ago.\n\nPerformance against USD\n\nBecause the price of BTC didn't move much over Week 35, the top altcoins' performance against USD was almost identical to their performance against BTC.\n\nIt is clear from these figures that, for the time being, Ethereum-based tokens are leading the charge into green digits.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain? Let us know on Twitter, or enter our latest survey competition to have your say.\n\nWBTC Supply is Growing Rapidly in the DeFi Boom\n\nWBTC (Wrapped BTC) is an ERC-20 token which is 1:1 backed by BTC (and minted by locking up BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain). By moving BTC onto the Ethereum blockchain - and thereby making it compatible with smart contracts - many use cases are unlocked, such as lending, liquidity provision, and decentralized exchange.\n\nAs the DeFi ecosystem continues to grow, the supply of WBTC is increasing rapidly as investors seek to capitalize on their BTC holdings via the added functionality and versatility provided by WBTC. In August alone, its supply has more than doubled.\n\nThe asset has grown from relative obscurity at the beginning of 2020 into a well-regarded component of the DeFi ecosystem, with a market cap of almost $400 million.\n\nOf its supply, 37% is locked up as collateral in Maker CDPs, 21% is providing lending liquidity on Aave, 15% is acting as liquidity on Curve.fi, and the remainder is mostly distributed across other DeFi protocols, including Compound, Set, and Balancer. In total, 97% of WBTC is locked in smart contracts, solidifying its use case as a smart contract-compatible version of BTC.\n\nThis presents an interesting quandary for bitcoin. While it clearly has more utility after being converted onto the Ethereum blockchain, its underlying value ostensibly comes from the 68 TWh of power that go into securing the Bitcoin blockchain each year. How much BTC has to migrate onto Ethereum before the necessity of the Bitcoin blockchain itself starts coming into question? And if this were to occur, what would back the value of BTC if not the massive amounts of energy that go into maintaining its existence?\n\nCompetition\nWin a free Advanced subscription to Glassnode Studio for a year\n\nWe want to make Glassnode Studio as useful and feature-rich as possible for our users.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 34, 2020)\n\nAfter touching $12k yet again, BTC has dropped back down into the mid-11000s. Altcoins are also losing market cap as the boom of the past few weeks slows down.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nAug 24, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nAfter starting the week at $11,850, bitcoin ended Week 34 down slightly, at $11,680. Despite surpassing $12k early in the week, BTC did not manage to maintain support at this level, dropping down to stabilize in the mid-11,000s for the remainder of the week.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals decreased slightly during Week 34. GNI lost 6 points, dropping from 71 to a current level of 65 points. This was due mostly to a decrease in the Sentiment subindex, while Network Health and Liquidity also saw small decreases.\n\nNetwork Health dropped by 2 points over Week 34, but nonetheless retains a high score of 81 points. A small decrease in network activity, as evidenced by a drop in overall transaction rate on the Bitcoin blockchain, caused this minor decline.\n\nLiquidity lost 4 points over the week, taking it down to 57 points, with minor losses occurring under both the trading liquidity and transaction liquidity subcategories, partially as a result of a continuing decline in BTC exchange balances.\n\nSentiment saw a large 16 point decrease as a result of lower saving behavior and investor sentiment. Much of this drop was caused by a decrease in the amount of BTC being accumulated by hodlers, but this figure remains positive, indicating continued optimistic sentiment.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nFor the 13th week in a row, the BTC compass remains in Regime 1, indicating continued bullish sentiment despite its failure to break out above $12k.\n\nBTC has performed well over the past few weeks, maintaining its position above $10k after testing this price level several times earlier in the year. Meanwhile, it hasn't dropped below $11k since the price started climbing in late July.\n\nDespite these gains, it has continued to struggle to surpass the new psychological barrier of $12k. However, ongoing bullish sentiment as evidenced by on-chain data suggests that many investors would continue to support a price above this level.\n\nAltcoin Digest\nPerformance against BTC\n\nThe top altcoins all lost value against BTC during Week 34. While LTC mostly remained on par with bitcoin, LINK fell almost 20% against BTC, after having gained more than 32% the previous week.\n\nPerformance against USD\n\nMeanwhile, the top altcoins and BTC all lost value against USD over the past week. The worst performer in the top 10 was LINK, which lost 20.5% of its value after gaining 33.4% the previous week.\n\nWhich altcoins would you like to see us cover in future editions of The Week On-Chain?

Gone are the days of paying a few cents for an Ethereum transaction - at least until scaling is improved or the DeFi movement dies down.\n\nIf you're wondering what caused the large spike in the chart above, check out our full analysis:\n\nHow DeFi is Driving The Spike in Ethereum’s Gas Price\nThe amount of fees being spent on Ethereum has reached an all-time high.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 33, 2020)\n\nBTC is still testing $12k as crypto's collective market cap continues to rise. On-chain fundamentals remain strong, but DeFi appears to be receiving more attention than bitcoin in the current market.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nAug 17, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nAfter climbing steadily through Week 32, BTC saw slightly more modest price gains for Week 33, increasing slightly from $11,700 to $11,870. It started the week with a rapid spike up to $12k, then traced back down to $11,250 before recovering toward the end of the week.\n\nAs of Monday, however, it has spiked above $12k, and is currently sitting at around $12,130.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals saw a slight increase during Week 33. GNI gained 2 points, bringing it back above 70. This was caused by increases in the Liquidity and Sentiment subindices, while Network Health dropped slightly.\n\nNetwork Health lost 1 point over the past week, bringing it to a still-strong 83 points. This decline was due to a small drop in the network growth subcategory, which lost 2 points over Week 33 as rates of growth slowed slightly.\n\nLiquidity increased by 4 points this past week, with transaction liquidity seeing a 6 point increase to bring it to 61 points. This was caused by an increased rate of on-chain transactions.\n\nSentiment also experienced a 4 point increase over Week 33, with increases in both the investor sentiment and saving behavior subcategories. The 6 point increase in saving behavior signifies that hodlers have started accumulating more BTC once again.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nOnce again, the compass remains in the bullish Regime 1 for Week 33, in the same cluster as it has been in for the past 4 weeks (5-10% price trend, 69-75 GNI), marking its 12th consecutive week in the green zone.\n\nThe compass' continued position in the upper right quadrant provides an optimistic signal of continued bullish sentiment and on-chain activity. This trend supports the widely circulating speculation that BTC is indeed in the early phases of entering a bull market.\n\nWith the growing interest in altcoins and general bullish sentiment within the cryptocurrency space, BTC may soon follow this trend to regain dominance in the market.\n\nOver 97% of Bitcoin UTXOs are in Profit\n\nThe percentage of bitcoin UTXOs in a state of profit has surpassed 97% as BTC's price continues to increase.\n\nHistorically, when the percentage of UTXOs in profit crosses the 95% threshold, BTC sees significant gains over a short period of time - usually around 2-3 months, although sometimes shorter.\n\nThe fact that over 97% of UTXOs are currently in profit means that less than 3% were created when the price was higher than it is now. Extended periods at this level and above are characteristic of bull runs as BTC moves toward new all-time highs (at which point the metric reaches 100%).\n\nKeep an eye on the Percent UTXOs in Profit metric to see whether this figure continues to increase.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 32, 2020)\n\nWith BTC now testing the $12k price point, it seems as though the next bull market may have begun. However, with on-chain fundamentals slowing slightly, investors should stay wary.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nAug 10, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin had another high-performing week, starting out Week 32 at around $11,100 and ending the week at $11,650. As of Monday morning, it has spiked up even further, and is currently hovering slightly below $12,000.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals decreased slightly throughout Week 32, with GNI slipping down to 69 points from 73 the previous week. This drop was due to slight decreases in on-chain fundamentals across all subindices - but overall on-chain health remains intact.\n\nNetwork Health lost 5 points over the past week, but remains strong at a score of 84 points. Network activity suffered slightly more than network growth during Week 32, as on-chain transactions slowed down relative to the previous week.\n\nLiquidity also saw a slight decrease, losing 3 points due to a drop in the transaction liquidity subcategory. This, in turn, was caused by the above-mentioned decrease in the number of on-chain transactions over the past week. However, overall transaction rates remain high relative to pre-bull market levels.\n\nSentiment dropped by 4 points during Week 32, as the saving behavior subcategory continued to drop. This was caused by a decrease in the rate at which hodlers are acquiring BTC - but this figure is still in the positive numbers, meaning that hodlers are still doubling down on BTC, but at a slower rate due to the increased price.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nWeek 32 represents the compass' 11th consecutive week in Regime 1, indicating an ongoing bullish outlook as BTC continues to see price gains.\n\nWhile GNI slid downward slightly this past week, BTC's price performance has improved, leaving the compass safely in the green bullish zone for the time being. Many on-chain signals point to the potential for further price increases - however, with on-chain fundamentals slowing slightly, investors should stay wary and keep a close eye on trends over the next week.\n\nBitcoin's STH-MVRV Value Supports Bull Market Thesis\n\nMVRV is the ratio between market cap and realized cap. By comparing these two metrics, MVRV can be used to get a sense of when an asset's price is above or below \"fair value\", thereby helping to spot market tops and bottoms. Short-Term Holder MVRV looks specifically at UTXOs younger than 155 days, indicating the behavior of short-term investors.\n\nHistorically, when this metric has emerged from below 1 and reached 1.25, this has marked the start of bull markets.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 31, 2020)\n\nBTC remained confidently above $10k throughout Week 31, and on-chain fundamentals point to the potential beginning of a bull market - but external market forces may still impact this potential.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nAug 3, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin had another eventful week, rising and staying above $10k for the first time since August 2019. The price rose from $9880 to a high of $12,030, before dropping sharply to end Week 31 at around $11,120.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals rose once again during Week 31, along with the price of BTC. GNI increased by 3 points to reach a value of 73 points, with this uptick being driven by increases in the Network Health and Liquidity subindices.\n\nNetwork Health gained 3 points over Week 31, with equal gains coming from the network growth and network liquidity subcategories, each at a score of 89 points. The number of new network users and active network users both increased over the past week.\n\nLiquidity increased by 7 points overall. Transaction liquidity gained 12 points as on-chain volumes rose, while trading liquidity suffered due to a decrease in stablecoin supply relative to BTC.\n\nSentiment lost 7 points over the past week due to a large decrease in the saving behavior subcategory. While overall sentiment is positive for BTC, a drop in the amount of bitcoin being acquired by hodlers led to a decrease in perceived saving.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nNow for the 10th week in a row, the compass remains in the bullish Regime 1, characterized by strong on-chain fundamentals and healthy quarterly price performance.\n\nAfter over 2 months of indicating an upcoming price increase, the compass' position in the bullish zone is finally being reflected in the price of BTC. Consistently strong on-chain fundamentals suggest that this may indeed be the beginning of the next bull market.\n\nHowever, despite strong sentiment, a crash in traditional markets (as has been forecast by many analysts) could halt this bull run in its tracks, as we saw on Black Thursday in March. As such, investors should remain cautious in their optimism, given the fragility of financial markets in the current day and age.\n\nClose to 95% of Bitcoin UTXOs are in Profit\n\nWith the price of BTC surpassing $10k over the past week, around 95% of bitcoin UTXOs are now in a state of profit - in other words, the price of BTC has increased since these UTXOs were created.\n\nTo see the extent to which these UTXOs are in profit or loss, we can look at bitcoin's UTXO Realized Price Distribution, which shows the distribution of UTXOs created above and below the current price. This chart shows that a majority of UTXOs are indeed in profit, while very few are in loss.\n\nBreaking this chart down further, we see that a small number of UTXOs are borderline in profit (those between ~$10k and the current price), while a larger portion are more comfortably in profit, having been created between $6000 and $10,000.\n\nThis is optimistic, because it means that a large portion of BTC holders are sitting comfortably in profit, but have chosen not to sell yet, implying confidence that the price will continue to rise.\n\nHowever, as mentioned above, investors should temper this optimism and stay informed about movements in global financial markets, as these have proven to be heavily correlated with cryptocurrencies as of late.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 30, 2020)\n\nAs on-chain fundamentals grow stronger, BTC has passed the $10,000 barrier - but rather than capitulating, miners are holding onto their coins, indicating high confidence.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nJul 27, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin has seen significant gains over the past week, consistently rising in price from $9190 to $9900. Early on Monday morning, BTC passed $10k, and is currently sitting around $10,250.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals have seen an increase during Week 30. GNI gained 8 points, taking it up to a total of 70. The rise was mostly driven by a large increase in the Sentiment subindex, with smaller gains in Liquidity also contributing.\n\nNetwork Health stayed static during Week 30, remaining at a score of 86 points. Network growth declined slightly, while network activity increased, with a greater number of entities active on-chain.\n\nLiquidity saw a modest 3 point increase, driven by rises in both trading (off-chain) and transaction (on-chain) liquidity. BTC exchange inflows saw an increase, leading to higher trading liquidity, while on-chain transactions also picked up over the week.\n\nSentiment was the highest performer of the week, clocking a 34 point increase as investor sentiment improved significantly. The percent of BTC's supply in profit saw large increases during Week 30, while hodlers also began to acquire more BTC, leading to an increase in the saving behavior subcategory.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nThe compass continues to sit in the bullish Regime 1 for Week 30 - its 9th consecutive week in this position - breaking ahead to reach one of its highest GNI scores of the year, while price performance remains positive.\n\nAfter so many weeks sitting in the bullish zone, we have been anticipating an increase in the BTC price for a while. Now, with today's BTC breakout above $10k, many are questioning whether we are entering the next bull run.\n\nThe psychological barrier of $10k is an important one for BTC to have broken, and the fact that it hasn't immediately dropped down into the $9000s is a positive sign. Given that this barrier has just been broken, it is too early to make definitive statements about whether we will see capitulation or growing confidence at this price - but the early signals are positive.\n\nBitcoin Is Flowing into Exchanges, But Miners Are Not Capitulating\n\nWith the breakout over $10k, we are seeing a huge increase in the percentage of BTC that are in profit. Currently, 89% of BTC are in a state of profit, meaning that only 11% would be sold at a loss if sold at this price.\n\nGiven this increase in profitable holdings, the inflow of BTC to exchanges has started to significantly increase as the price surges above $10k. After months of bitcoin flowing out of exchanges, net flow is now seeing its largest hourly spike in over 3 months.\n\nUnderstandably, with BTC surpassing the psychological $10k barrier, there will be a fair amount of desire to sell, hence the increase in exchange deposits. However, this sell pressure does not seem to have fazed miners, who appear to be holding onto their coins rather than capitalizing on the price increase.\n\nThe fact that miners are not capitulating suggests an underlying confidence in bitcoin's fundamentals and growth potential, despite the increased flow to exchanges from non-miner entities.\n\nKeep an eye on bitcoin's Exchange Net Flow and Miner Outflow Volume to see whether these trends continue.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nEntities Supply Distribution (BTC) - A series of metrics showing the number of entities holding specific amounts of BTC across several balance bands.\nFeatures\nGlassnode API - Introduced human-readable timestamps for both JSON and CSV formats.\nCompetition\nWin a free Advanced subscription to Glassnode Studio for a year.\n\nWe want to make our Glassnode Insights content as high-quality and relevant as possible.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 29, 2020)\n\nFor yet another week, bitcoin's price has stayed consistent at around $9200. Meanwhile, its on-chain fundamentals continue to grow stronger.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nJul 20, 2020 • 3 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin spent yet another week fluctuating around the $9200 mark, starting off Week 29 at $9260 and ending it around $9185. It barely went past $9300 on the higher end and $9100 on the lower end, mostly staying within +/-$100 of the $9200 price point.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals saw a slight increase during Week 29. GNI gained 2 points, bringing it up to a score of 62. While the Sentiment subindex brought down the index this past week, Network Health and Liquidity both increased, leading to an overall climb in the health of the Bitcoin network.\n\nNetwork Health climbed by 8 points throughout the past week, driven by a 20 point increase in the Network Growth subcategory. This growth was in turn caused by a steep increase in the number of new entities joining the network, indicating high adoption.\n\nLiquidity also saw a small increase over Week 29, climbing by 3 points. Transaction liquidity increased slightly, but trading liquidity saw the larger increase over the past week, gaining 11 points as the supply of stablecoins continued to increase, providing liquidity to the BTC markets.\n\nSentiment saw a marked decrease over the past week, unlike the other subindices, with a 10 point decrease resulting largely from a drop in the Saving Behavior subcategory. This was caused by a drop in hodler accumulation - however, net accumulation by hodlers is still positive.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nThe compass once again remained in Regime 1 for Week 29, marking its 8th consecutive week in this regime.\n\nWhile price performance slipped slightly from the previous week, an increase in GNI means that the compass for Week 29 remains comfortably in the green \"bullish\" zone.\n\nOnce again, however, bitcoin's uncharacteristically stable price casts doubts on its ability to break out past the $10k mark. While on-chain fundamentals remain healthy and overall crypto market liquidity is high, a psychological barrier seems to be blocking a bull run for the time being.\n\nBitcoin's Reserve Risk Grows More Favorable\n\nReserve Risk is used to assess the confidence of long-term holders relative to the price of BTC. Low Reserve Risk means that confidence is high and price is low, indicating an attractive risk/reward ratio in favor of investing.\n\nBTC's Reserve Risk has been in the green zone since September 2019 and is still declining, indicating that the risk of investing in BTC is currently low relative to the prospective reward.\n\nThis metric supports the position of the Glassnode compass in the green \"bullish\" zone, as investing in BTC now is a solid proposition according to its Reserve Risk score.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nPercent Entities in Profit (BTC) - New metric showing the proportion of entities who are currently in a state of profit.\nNew Account-Based metrics (BTC, ETH) - Account-Based versions of Unrealized Profit, Unrealized Loss, NUPL, LTH-NUPL, and STH-NUPL.\nNew Futures metrics (BTC) - Huobi (Perpetual Open Interest, Perpetual Funding Rate) and Bitflyer (Daily Volume, Latest 24h Volume).\nFeatures\nGlassnode API - Reduced caching time to 1 minute for faster responses.\nCompare feature - Added resolution dropdown for each trace.\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 28, 2020)\n\nBitcoin has had another strong week throughout Week 28, with strengthening on-chain fundamentals and a gradual increase in price.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nJul 13, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin saw some modest gains throughout Week 28, starting the week around $9070 and ending at $9260. Wednesday saw a brief spike above $9400, but this was quickly reversed on Thursday, leaving BTC to once again fluctuate around the $9200 mark.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals increased over Week 28, with GNI gaining 4 points, bringing it back up to a value of 60. While the Network Health and Liquidity subindices remained static, the increase in GNI was driven by a large jump in the Sentiment subindex.\n\nNetwork Health stayed at 78 points this week. The network growth category lost some traction as adoption slowed slightly, while network activity conversely increased as a result of a higher number of active entities on-chain.\n\nLiquidity also stayed consistent with the previous week, staying at 47 points. While transaction liquidity increased due to higher on-chain activity, trading liquidity decreased as BTC's exchange balance remained low.\n\nSentiment saw a massive 21 point increase, more than doubling its score and bringing it to 49 points. Saving behavior saw modest increases as hodlers acquired more BTC, but the main increase was in investor sentiment, which saw a 26 point increase as the amount of BTC in profit went up.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nDuring Week 28, the compass saw improvements both in terms of GNI and price performance, setting itself up for its 7th consecutive week in Regime 1.\n\nIts continued presence in the bullish green zone is a sign of strong fundamentals for bitcoin. On-chain activity has been consistently high for the past several months, and while BTC's price has stayed uncharacteristically stable, it is still performing positively relative to the beginning of the year.\n\nAs noted in last week's issue, external market forces such as systemic uncertainty and unknown correlations with traditional markets may prevent BTC from breaking out at this stage, but signals remain strong nonetheless.\n\nStablecoin Supply is High Relative to BTC\n\nBitcoin's Stablecoin Supply Ratio is reaching new lows as more money flows into stablecoins.\n\nThis metric - representing the ratio between the supply of money in BTC and the supply of stablecoins - highlights the theoretical readiness of money to flow into BTC. The more money held in stablecoins, the higher the potential for a large inflow of capital into BTC on short notice.\n\nAs more money flows into stablecoins, this drives the SSR value down, representing an increased supply of stablecoins theoretically ready to flow into BTC.\n\nCurrently, for every dollar in BTC, there are 6.5 cents in stablecoins. This is comparatively high relative to values seen, for example, in early 2018 - when there were only 1.1 cents in stablecoins for every dollar in BTC. Theoretically, if all money in stablecoins were to flow into BTC, it would increase bitcoin's market cap by 6.5% (although in practice this would be more, as the increased demand would drive up the price of BTC).\n\nHowever, while a low SSR is generally a bullish sign for bitcoin, purchasing BTC is of course not the only use case of stablecoins. With this rise in stablecoin supply, we might be seeing people preparing to buy into BTC en masse, but these funds may also be earmarked for another purpose, such as buying into the altcoin pump.\n\nOr, alternatively, the rise in stablecoin supply might be only tangentially related to the crypto markets. In these uncertain times, we could be seeing the adoption of a new way of storing USD wealth. Bitcoin's price movements in the coming weeks may shed more light on where these stablecoins are heading, if they move at all.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Overall, BTC dropped ever so slightly throughout Week 27, opening at $9125 and closing out the week at $9070.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals rose slightly during Week 27. GNI increased by 1 point, reaching a score of 56 points. This was caused by a decent recovery of the Sentiment subindex, and a small increase in Network Health as well.\n\nNetwork Health increased from 75 points to 78 for Week 27, with network growth and activity both seeing modest increases as a result of a greater number of active entities on-chain and more new entities joining the network.\n\nLiquidity dropped by 6 points over the past week, losing ground in terms of both trading and transaction liquidity as exchange deposits and on-chain transactions decreased.\n\nSentiment increased after declining for the previous 2 weeks, signaling a reversal in its decline. This was caused by a large 64.7% increase in saving behavior as hodlers started acquiring more BTC.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nThe compass remains in a bullish position, staying in Regime 1 for the 6th week in a row, but drifting slightly downward in terms of both GNI and price performance, taking it closer to a more neutral zone.\n\nDespite this slight decline, however, on-chain and price indicators still place the compass in an optimistic state. While BTC has remained surprisingly stable over the past couple of months, indicators are pointing to an imminent breakout, with fundamentals remaining consistently strong.\n\nHowever, external factors such as bitcoin's as yet unconfirmed correlation with traditional financial markets mean that uncertainty remains in spite of positive signals within the market.\n\nBitcoin Whales Appear to be HODLing\n\nAs we reported in-depth last week, Bitcoin's whale population is seeing its largest period of sustained growth since 2016. Much of this growth has coincided with a withdrawal of BTC from exchanges, suggesting that whales may be the reason for this exodus.\n\nThis is supported by the large increase in the proportion of exchange withdrawals being made by whales after Black Thursday.\n\nAs BTC balances on exchanges drop while on-chain whale holdings increase, we can deduce that whales may have used Black Thursday as an opportunity to get in at the bottom and then withdraw their bitcoin to HODL for the longer term in anticipation of the next bull run.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 26, 2020)\n\nDespite a drop in BTC's price and GNI score, long-term sentiment is optimistic, with investors hodling more than ever.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nJun 29, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin's price took a tumble over the past week after climbing on Monday and Tuesday. The weekend saw it briefly brush below the $9000 mark before settling back up just above $9100.\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals dropped slightly during Week 26. GNI decreased by 2 points, slipping into the \"neutral\" zone at 55 points, once again due to decreases in the Sentiment subindex.\n\nNetwork Health increased by 1 point last week, with network growth staying static while network activity saw a slight uptick as the number of active entities on-chain increased.\n\nLiquidity saw the week's largest increase of all the subindices, increasing by 6 points to settle back above 50. This was driven by a small increase in off-chain trading liquidity, and a larger increase in transaction liquidity as on-chain transfers increased.\n\nSentiment once again took a hit over the past week, decreasing by 20 points and reaching a score of just 22 points. This decrease was caused predominantly by a 22 point decrease in the investor sentiment subcategory, which itself decreased due to a drop in MVRV and the supply of BTC in profit. Despite this, however, long-term sentiment remains positive.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nThe Glassnode Compass outlines the general regime in which Bitcoin is currently located, based on its on-chain fundamentals (as determined by the GNI) and its recent price behavior.\n\nFor the fifth week in a row, the compass is in Regime 1, representing a bullish state for the market and for on-chain activity. GNI and bitcoin's price trend both slipped slightly from the previous week, but still remain firmly in the green zone.\n\nThis continued stability, both on-chain and off-chain, is a good sign for BTC. Hodling behavior is reaching new highs, suggesting that investors anticipate upwards growth. While this bullish sentiment will not necessarily translate to immediate gains for the price of BTC, the long-term outlook is optimistic.\n\n61% of Bitcoin Haven't Moved in Over a Year\n\nWe recently released a series of Supply Last Active metrics, which show how long BTC haven't been moved for. These show that over 61% of BTC haven't moved in over a year; a new all-time high for this metric.\n\nMoreover, the number of BTC which haven't moved in 2+ years is at 44%, approaching a new ATH and showing that we are in a period of sustained HODLing.\n\nThe last time the number of coins last active 1+ years ago exceeded 60% was in early 2016, just before the price started increasing ever-more-rapidly leading up to the bull run to $20k.\n\nThis clear hodling behavior is macro bullish for bitcoin, supporting the narrative that BTC is a store of value. As we have seen in the past, long-term hodling is usually followed by bull markets. It shows that investors overwhelmingly believe that, at current prices, BTC is worth holding rather than selling - suggesting that sentiment favors the price going up.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nThermocap (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH) - Metric showing the aggregated USD security spend based on coins paid to miners.\nAddresses with Non-Zero Balance (ERC20) - Updated this metric to include ERC20 tokens, alongside BTC and ETH.\nExchange Balance (stacked) (BTC, ETH, ERC20) - Added a stacked chart showing coin balance on different exchanges in a single view.\nExchange metric updates (BTC) - Updated labels to improve accuracy of exchange metrics for Coinbase.\nAdded supports for more tokens (ERC20) - COMP, FET, SEELE, DGX, LEO, REP, OKB, NMR, UBT, RDN.\nFeatures\nResolution - Added monthly and weekly resolution.\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

While on-chain activity and growth stayed largely consistent, small declines impacted the overall Network Health subindex.\n\nLiquidity gained 3 points, reversing losses seen the previous week and bringing it to a value of 47 points. Its incline over the past week was caused by an increase in on-chain transaction activity, while trading liquidity (i.e. exchange flows and volumes) saw a small decrease.\n\nSentiment was the biggest loser of the past week, losing 7 points and dropping to a value of 42 points. Although the saving behaviour subcategory increased, this was negated by a large decrease in investor sentiment, which suffered as a result of the slight price decrease and the requisite loss in BTC's supply in profit.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nThe Glassnode Compass outlines the general regime in which Bitcoin is currently located, based on its on-chain fundamentals (as determined by the GNI) and its recent price behavior.\n\nThe slight decreases in both GNI and price caused the compass for Week 25 to drop down closer to a bearish position. However, despite the decreases, it still sits firmly in the bullish Regime 1 for the fourth week in a row.\n\nThis provides a positive signal for bitcoin, suggesting some stability in on-chain activity as well as off-chain action. Despite healthy activity however, it appears that the market is being held back in terms of upward price movement for the time being. In order to break the $10k mark, the market will need to overcome the psychological barrier that comes with that price level.\n\nBitcoin's Realized Cap at All-Time High\n\nBitcoin's Realized Cap is continually hitting all-time highs, having just reached a new high of $106.7b after surpassing its previous high attained just before Black Thursday.\n\nRealized Cap values bitcoins at the price at which they were last moved, in order to discount the value of lost coins and give active coins a more realistic economic weighting. Its high value means that BTC's MVRV Ratio can stay relatively low, despite prices being quite high.\n\nMVRV (the ratio of Market Cap to Realized Cap) shows when BTC is being traded at above or below \"fair value\" relative to its realized price. When the market value (i.e. price) drops below the realized value, this implies that bitcoin is being traded at below \"fair value\".\n\nThus, a consistently high (and growing) Realized Cap means that the price of BTC has more room to grow while still being in the realm of fair value in terms of the actual economic weight of all coins in circulation.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nAddresses in Profit/Loss (BTC, ETH) - New metrics added for Percent Addresses in Profit, Addresses in Profit, and Addresses in Loss.\nSupply Last Active (BTC, BCH) - New metrics for percentage of supply inactive for 1+ years, 2+ years, 3+ years, and 5+ years.\nExchange metric updates (BTC) - Updated labels to improve accuracy of exchange metrics for Binance, Bitstamp, Bittrex, HitBTC, Huobi, OKEx, Poloniex, and Luno.\nFeatures\nHigher resolution - Added 10 minute resolution for most Tier 2 metrics.\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 24, 2020)\n\nDespite a drop in bitcoin's price and on-chain fundamentals in Week 24, the overall health of the network remains strong.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nJun 15, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin saw a ~4% drop over Week 24, starting off at around $9750 before dropping significantly on Thursday and ending the week at $9380.\n\nAfter growing for 2 weeks, Bitcoin on-chain fundamentals dropped during Week 24. GNI lost 4 points, dropping down to 58 points as market sentiment decreased along with bitcoin's price, but this was mitigated by increased network activity and growth.\n\nRead more about how these values are broken down\n\nNetwork Health saw a 4 point increase last week as the number of new and active network participants increased for the second week in a row, marking an end to a relatively slow period of on-chain activity on the Bitcoin network.\n\nLiquidity dropped slightly last week; while trading liquidity increased, transaction liquidity decreased by 7 points as the volume of BTC transacted on-chain decreased.\n\nSentiment saw the largest drop of the week, decreasing by 19 points due in large part to bitcoin's price drop on Thursday. While saving behavior increased by 11 points, investor sentiment took a hit as more BTC dropped out of a state of profit.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nThe Glassnode Compass outlines the general regime in which Bitcoin is currently located, based on its on-chain fundamentals (as determined by the GNI) and its recent price behavior.\n\nAfter remaining inside the bullish Regime 1 throughout Weeks 22 and 23, the compass solidifies its position in the green zone for yet another week during Week 24, with price performance and GNI both only slightly lower than the previous week.\n\nThe losses of Week 24 likely indicate more of a slip than an overall downward trend. If this is the case, the compass should stay in a bullish position in Regime 1 over the coming weeks. However, market observers should look towards not just stable on-chain activity, but rather an increase in on-chain fundamentals, to give BTC a push in price in the near term.\n\nBitcoin's Whale Population Keeps Growing\n\nDespite the volatile market movements of 2020, the number of bitcoin whales has been growing near-consistently since January, with a current value of 1882 entities holding at least 1000 BTC.\n\nThe last time this figure was so high was in September 2017, just as BTC was on its rapid ascent to $20k. Perhaps more interestingly, the first time we saw this many whales was in March 2016, when bitcoin was still under $420.\n\nThe price of BTC is now more than 20x higher than it was when we first saw this many whales, implying that more wealth is being held by whales. However, the average balance held by each whale has decreased during this period, such that whales actually hold less BTC now than in 2016, and less wealth (in USD terms) than in 2017.\n\nRead our in-depth analysis of BTC whales here:\n\nNew Bitcoin Whales: Where Are They Coming From?\nBitcoin’s whale population is on the rise for the first time since 2016.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 23, 2020)\n\nOn-chain fundamentals began to recover in Week 23, with GNI gaining 6 points. However, the impact of this increase on BTC's price is yet to be realized.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nJun 8, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin's price increased slightly over Week 23. Prices mostly fluctuated between $9500 and $9800, but BTC experienced a classic \"Bart Simpson\" pattern on Tuesday, spiking up to above $10,100 for around 15 hours before returning to the mid-9000s.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin on-chain fundamentals began to recover during Week 23. After several weeks of trending downward, GNI increased by 6 points, placing it back in the strong zone at 62 points. This was driven by an overall improvement in fundamentals, which saw all GNI sub-indices and their sub-categories experiencing an uptick last week.\n\nRead more about how these values are broken down\n\nNetwork Health increased by 5 points over the past week after improvements in network growth (i.e. adoption) and network activity. This increase follows a previous downtrend throughout the month of May, which saw the number of active and new entities decrease by over 10%.\n\nLiquidity saw a 7 point increase last week, bringing it back into the neutral zone after having dropped down into the weak zone the previous week. Currently at 48 points, this increase was mainly driven by an 18% increase in transaction liquidity as on-chain transactions increased and fees continued to decrease after experiencing a post-halving spike.\n\nSentiment also increased last week, rising by 6 points as investors refrained from selling despite prices being in the high-9000s and even spiking above $10k for a day. This apparent hodling behavior suggests that investors may have an optimistic outlook on price in the near future.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nThe Glassnode Compass outlines the general regime in which Bitcoin is currently located, based on its on-chain fundamentals (as determined by the GNI) and its recent price behavior.\n\nAfter rising into the bullish Regime 1 during Week 22, the compass is now squarely in the green zone after experiencing increases in both GNI and quarterly price performance during Week 23.\n\nWith on-chain fundamentals seemingly on the rise and BTC seeing sustained values over $9k, the outlook for bitcoin seems to be stabilizing in the optimistic zone. However, market observers should watch for another week or two of continued growth in on-chain activity and adoption to determine whether this is an upwards trend or an isolated period of growth.\n\nBitcoin Miners Continue Hodling BTC\n\nThe flow of BTC from miners to exchanges dropped significantly following the halving, and has yet to recover almost a month later.\n\nMiners are holding off on realizing their BTC profits (Glassnode Studio)\n\nLogic dictates that the flow of BTC from miners to exchanges should drop by around 50% after a halving event, as BTC-denominated revenue drops by almost this amount (slightly less, due to fees staying consistent or even increasing). However, the number of BTC being sold by miners dropped by more like 65%, suggesting that miners are withholding their profits until the price increases.\n\nRead our full article on this trend to understand the possible effects of miners selling their withheld BTC when the price rises in the future.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nMiners Flow to Exchanges (BTC) - This metric shows the total amount of coins transferred from miners to exchange wallets.

After slowing in accumulation for over a month, hodlers began to increase their positions at greater rates once again, with increased confidence likely stemming from bullish price movements.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nThe Glassnode Compass outlines the general regime in which Bitcoin is currently located, based on its on-chain fundamentals (as determined by the GNI) and its recent price behavior.\n\nDespite declining on-chain fundamentals, Bitcoin's price increase over the past week has pushed it upwards into the bullish Regime 1 for the first time in 3 months, marking a return to pre-crash levels.\n\nA decrease in GNI means that the compass is in danger of slipping into the transitional Regime 2, so we should be looking for an increase in on-chain fundamentals over the coming weeks to solidify its current position by pushing it further into Regime 1.\n\nAlmost 90% of Bitcoin's Supply is in Profit\n\nBitcoin's Percent Supply in Profit indicates the relative proportion of BTC which are in a state of profit (i.e. the price has increased since they were last moved). Currently, over 89% of BTC are in a state of profit, signalling a potential return to a more bullish market.\n\nPercent Supply in Profit is at its highest point since the bull run of June 2019, having been steeply increasing since its low of 45% after Black Thursday. Historically, levels of 90% and higher have clearly marked pronounced bull markets.\n\nWith a very slight further price increase, this metric may soon reach the 90% level. However, whether this leads to sustained bullish price movement or a downward retrace remains to be seen.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nRealized Cap HODL Waves (BTC) - RCHW weights HODL Waves by Realized Price.\nFutures (BTC) - Latest 24h Futures Volume, Latest Futures Open Interest.\nFeatures\nUpdated BTC futures dashboard.\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nJoin our Telegram channel\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 21, 2020)\n\nAs the price of BTC slips back below $9k, on-chain fundamentals are also showing signs of decline, pushing Bitcoin closer to bearish territory.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nMay 25, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals saw a distinct decline during Week 21. GNI decreased by 13 points, down to a value of 60. This drop - mainly driven by decreases in Sentiment and Liquidity - solidifies the trajectory change seen in Week 20; for the time being, on-chain fundamentals are in decline, alongside Bitcoin's price.\n\nRead more about how these values are broken down here.\n\nNetwork Health is still relatively high, at a value of 78 points. However, the past week's decreases in growth and overall activity on the Bitcoin network have seen it drop by 7 points from last week. While still at high levels relative to the past year, investors should keep an eye on this index's current downward trajectory.\n\nLiquidity's 14 point decrease last week brings it down to 43 points, its lowest value since January 2020. After gradually increasing since August last year, this sudden drop was caused in part by decreases in exchange inflows and on-chain transaction volumes.\n\nAlongside this decline in Bitcoin's economic activity, Sentiment has dropped by 20 points. This has been driven by an overall decrease in economic activity in relation to the price of BTC, as well as a slowing down of hodlers' accumulation behavior; while hodlers are still accumulating, the rate at which they are doing so is declining.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nThe Glassnode Compass outlines the general regime in which Bitcoin is currently located, based on its on-chain fundamentals (as determined by the GNI) and its recent price behavior.\n\nThe compass has slid closer to the bearish Regime 4 this week, due to GNI's 13 point drop. While a slight increase in BTC's quarterly returns pushed it up fractionally along the Y axis, the overall decrease in on-chain fundamentals threatens to undo this progress in the coming weeks.\n\nWith BTC no longer testing $10k, we may be seeing a regression back into bearish territory if on-chain activity and overall market health continue to decline. However, whether or not the halving is priced in remains to be seen; it took several months before BTC turned bullish after the last halving, and over a year for the price to increase by an order of magnitude.\n\nPost-Halving, Bitcoin's Miner Revenue from Fees are Returning to Normal\n\nAfter experiencing a significant spike after the halving, the proportion of total revenue that Bitcoin miners are making from fees appears to be returning to normal.\n\nIn general, the higher on-chain transaction volumes are, the higher fees will be. However, the recent spike did not correlate with an increase in on-chain activity, but rather resulted from the prioritization of higher-fee transactions by miners in order to offset decreased revenue post-halving.\n\nThe subsequent decline over the past 5 days has likely been the result of a difficulty decrease, which has eased some of the financial pressure on the remaining miners. Despite this, we likely won't see a total return to previous levels of miner revenue from fees, as miners will need more time to adjust to the new economic realities of a 6.25 BTC block reward.\n\nProduct Updates\nMetrics and Assets\nFee Ratio Multiple (BTC, ETH, other major assets) - FRM is a measure of a blockchain's security and gives an assessment how secure a chain is once block rewards disappear.\nDistribution Metrics (ETH) - Added 1% Richlist Balance, Gini, Herfindahl Index, and Supply in Smart Contracts for ETH.\nAdded support for WBTC and WETH.\nFeatures\nMetric Overview - A new homepage for Glassnode Studio, showing core BTC and ETH metrics with their most up-to-date values and recent performance.\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (Week 20, 2020)\n\nAs Bitcoin tests the $10k mark again, investors continue withdrawing their BTC from exchanges even after the halving.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nMay 18, 2020 • 3 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals dropped slightly in Week 20. GNI registered a 1 point decrease over the week, pushing its overall assessment of the Bitcoin ecosystem to 73 points. This downturn was mainly driven by the Network Health subindex, which decreased by 8 points.\n\nRead more about how these values are broken down here.\n\nNetwork Health was particularly high last week as a result of heightened activity leading up to the Bitcoin halving. As such, this week's 8 point decrease should not be taken to signify an unhealthy network, but rather a return to the network's previous growth trajectory. This subindex is still up 70% from last month, and 240% for the year.\n\nLiquidity registered a small decrease of 2 points as a result of a lower number of on-chain transactions over the past week. However, an 8 point increase in trading liquidity meant that overall liquidity remained relatively steady.\n\nAfter suffering a large decrease during Week 19, Sentiment has fully recovered, with a 14 point increase over the past week. This was driven by a large 20 point increase in investor sentiment, while saving behavior decreased by 10 points.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nThe Glassnode Compass outlines the general regime in which Bitcoin is currently located, based on its on-chain fundamentals (as determined by the GNI) and its recent price behavior.\n\nThis week, the compass has edged closer to the bullish Regime 1 as BTC's quarterly returns increased slightly. It currently remains in Regime 3, in a transition phase which represents strong on-chain fundamentals but non-exceptional price performance. With BTC testing $10k, Regime 1 is well within scope in the coming weeks, provided that the current price trend persists.\n\nOverall, Bitcoin's market health remains strong, but indicators point to a forecast which is not overly bullish. While a post-halving price increase is not out of the question, it is likely that the halving is already priced in, and that a breakout in the near future would be optimistic.\n\nBTC Balance on Exchanges Experiences its Largest Decrease in Bitcoin's History\n\nThe number of BTC on exchanges has been steadily decreasing since the crash in March, and is now approaching a 1 year low. This is the largest and most prolonged BTC exchange balance downtrend in Bitcoin's history.\n\nA possible explanation for this decrease is that investors are withdrawing funds from exchanges to hold in cold storage, implying a longer-term outlook. This is supported by the continued increase in the number of BTC whales, as well as continued hodler accumulation over the past 2 months.\n\nThis trend towards withdrawing from exchanges may be partially due to the expectation that BTC will increase in price following the halving. However, this does not tell the whole story, as ETH also began experiencing a similar trend of exchange withdrawals around the same time (albeit not to the same extent as BTC), despite having grown near-consistently for 2 years.\n\nAnother partial explanation may be lack of trust; withdrawals from BitMEX, which experienced downtime during the March crash, have been more pronounced than withdrawals from other exchanges. Overall, however, withdrawal for hodling purposes seems to be having a greater effect than lack of trust.\n\nKeep an eye on BTC Exchange Balance to see if this trend continues.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Hash rate follows its trajectory as miners keep mining.\n\nGlassnode\nMay 12, 2020 • 3 min read\nA Note on GNI: Our New On-Chain Index\n\nWe recently released a new, industry-leading on-chain index, the GNI (Glassnode Index). Below, you will find these new valuation methods applied to the past week of Bitcoin data.\n\nWith this new toolset, we are bringing you an updated version of The Week On-Chain, with better insights into Bitcoin's behavior than ever before.\n\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin on-chain fundamentals dropped slightly in Week 19. GNI registered a 2 point decrease over the week, pushing its overall assessment of the Bitcoin ecosystem to 74 points, the 10th highest weekly value since 2017. This downturn was mainly driven by the Sentiment subindex, which decreased by 13 points.\n\nRead more about how these values are broken down here.\n\nNetwork Health improved through solid gains in both Network Growth and Network Activity, the former reaching the highest possible value for the first time since 2017.\n\nLiquidity has seen marginal improvement over the last few weeks after registering increases in Transaction Liquidity and slight decreases in Trading Liquidity. After staying close to the 50 point mark for 5 weeks, it has now worked its way up by 9 points.\n\nIn the lead up to Bitcoin’s third halving, Sentiment on the other hand has begun to drop sharply. Despite this, however, overall network health remains strong.\n\nGlassnode Compass\n\nThe Glassnode Compass outlines the general regime in which Bitcoin is currently located, based on its on-chain fundamentals (as determined by the GNI) and its recent price behavior.\n\nThis week, the compass is still well away from the bearish Regime 4, characterised by a declining Bitcoin price and weakening on-chain fundamentals. Rather, it sits firmly in transition Regime 3 which is characterised by a diverging Bitcoin price and on-chain fundamentals. While Bitcoin’s price has recovered since the price drop in mid March, the GN Compass accounts for the quarterly trend, and as such the recent price drop has prevented it from breaking into Regime 1.\n\nOverall, after mostly positive developments in the GNI through Q1, it has experienced a small pull back solely due to Sentiment taking a hit in the days before the halving. While the on-chain fundamentals are still strong in the long term, the halving is likely priced in, and it might be too soon to expect bullish price action in the summer.\n\nBitcoin Hash Rate Largely Unaffected by Halving\n\nWhile some market observers have predicted a decrease in hash rate after the halving, this eventuality does not seem to be occurring. When the halving happened late Monday evening, Bitcoin's hash rate dropped slightly before recovering to its previous trajectory.\n\nWhile some people have predicted that the halving will render mining unprofitable for many miners, causing mass capitulation, this effect appears to have been mitigated by global economic circumstances which make mining cheaper, such as extremely low energy prices and the devaluation of currencies in which miner overhead is denominated, for example in countries such as Russia.\n\nAlong with Bitcoin's strong fundamentals, this suggests a stable, if not bullish, environment for BTC over the coming months. Keep an eye on Bitcoin's hash rate to see whether the halving has an effect on this metric later on.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

With this new toolset, we are bringing you an updated version of The Week On-Chain, with better insights into Bitcoin's behavior than ever before.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter, and keep an eye on your inbox for our new weekly market summary, released each Monday, which will provide a recap of BTC's performance over the previous week and an outlook for the future based on GNI and Glassnode's Market Compass.\n\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nAfter spiking above $9k last Thursday and dropping back down to the high 8000s shortly afterwards, BTC has experienced a gradual increase back up to levels above $9000, currently sitting at around $9300.\n\nAlongside BTC's price growth, on-chain fundamentals have seen increases across the board for the second week in a row. The number of transactions, number of active entities, and total volume have all increased as on-chain economic activity surges before the halving.\n\nThe number of active addresses (and entities) has increased to levels not seen since the 2017 bull market - as has the number of new addresses - suggesting an increase not just in activity, but also in adoption.\n\nThe number of active addresses and new addresses in the Bitcoin network have reached 2-year highs (Glassnode Studio)\n\nNot only are we seeing increased on-chain activity from new adopters, but also from longer-term investors; specifically, hodlers and whales.\n\nHodlers Continue Accumulating BTC as Halving Approaches\n\nHodler Net Position Change has stayed positive during the recovery of the past 8 weeks, indicating optimistic sentiment and longer-term confidence as we approach the Bitcoin halving next week.\n\nHodlers are accumulating, indicating underlying confidence in the price of bitcoin and its prospects (Glassnode Studio)\n\nIn February this year, hodlers stopped accumulating BTC as the price rose over $10,000, indicating decreasing confidence in prices at that level. However, during the crash in mid-March, we saw meaningful accumulation as longer-term investors bought the dip. This quickly dropped away as the price began to recover, but once investors saw that another crash was seeming less likely, they started accumulating again.\n\nHodlers’ continued accumulation even at these price levels suggests confidence in the near-term and longer-term future, likely spurred by the upcoming halving, which tends to drive higher prices historically. This accumulation can also be partially explained by the increasing adoption of bitcoin as a safe haven asset amongst uncertain financial markets.\n\nCommunity Insight\n\nContent and insights derived from Glassnode data by our community\n\nOn-chain analyst Willy Woo highlighted the \"macro bullish\" trend of BTC accumulation by smart investors, using Glassnode's data on whales.\n\n#whalebreedingseason Whale population spotted increasing in the wild. They've been in solid accumulation mode since January unperturbed by the COVID crash. This is macro bullish.\n\nWhales are entities holding 1000 BTC+, data by @glassnode pic.twitter.com/6HLFapIfNe\n\n— Willy Woo (@woonomic) May 6, 2020\n\nLooking at the gray-blue line in the above chart, we see that the number of whales has been growing consistently throughout the year, experiencing only a small drop during the crash in March.\n\nOn top of this, the consistent increase in the number of addresses with more than 10k BTC implies that not only is the number of whales increasing, but the size of their holdings is as well.\n\nStay updated on the Number of Whales to keep watching this trend, and remember to send us your own content using Glassnode data to be featured in our next weekly update.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (22 Apr 2020 - 29 Apr 2020)\n\nBTC market sentiment is optimistic as price recovers to pre-crash levels and on-chain activity increases significantly.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nApr 30, 2020 • 3 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nAfter gradually increasing from around $7500 to $8000 this week, BTC experienced a rapid spike, peaking above $9k yesterday and settling just below that point as of today.\n\nAlong with price, on-chain fundamentals are also recovering to pre-crash levels. January and February saw a significant increase in on-chain activity, which fell away in March but is now returning to previous levels.\n\nOn-chain volumes experienced a larger increase than transaction count this week, implying an increase in the average volume of each transaction. This increase in the number of BTC sent per transaction suggests that the activity is being driven by larger investors, rather than traders and market opportunists.\n\nBTC On Track to Match Stock-To-Flow Forecasts as Halving Approaches\n\nBitcoin's Stock to Flow (S2F) Ratio has risen back to predicted levels, after deviating from this trend during the crash in March.\n\nS2F predicts that BTC will reach $95k by mid-2021 (Glassnode Studio)\n\nStock to Flow is a popular valuation model based on the assumption that scarcity drives value. It is defined as the ratio of the current stock of a commodity (i.e. circulating Bitcoin supply) and the flow of new production (i.e. newly mined bitcoins).\n\nBitcoin's price has historically followed the S2F Ratio, and its recent increase back above $9000 puts it back on track to continue hitting these forecasts. As we approach the next halving from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC mined per block, S2F predicts that we will see a more rapid increase in price, with the price increasing by an order of magnitude over the next year.\n\nWhile the model's prediction that BTC will exceed $95k by mid-2021 seems highly optimistic, this metric's historical accuracy in predicting the price of bitcoin paints an alluring narrative.\n\nCommunity Insight\n\nContent and insights derived from Glassnode data by our community\n\nThe Bitcoin network has seen new address growth of almost 25% in the past year, as highlighted by @Unfolded using data from Glassnode Studio.\n\nThe Bitcoin network has grown almost 25% within the last year\n\nAddresses holding BTC: +24.2%\nAddresses with ≥ 0.01 BTC: +18.5%\nAddresses with ≥ 0.1 BTC: +14.6%\nAddresses with ≥ 1 BTC: +11.4%\n\nvia @glassnode pic.twitter.com/DkPAIiuhqV\n\n— Unfolded (@cryptounfolded) April 27, 2020\n\nThis reflects an increase in adoption and activity as BTC becomes an increasingly favorable asset amidst global financial turmoil.\n\nStay updated on BTC Address Activity to keep watching this trend, and remember to send us your own content using Glassnode data to be featured in our next weekly update.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

It is currently priced at ~$7450, a nearly 5% increase for the day.\n\nOn-chain fundamentals for the week show a significant increase in activity on the Bitcoin network, with the number of transactions and the number of active entities rising.\n\nThis represents not only a recovery to pre-crash levels, but also a significant increase in activity as compared to the start of 2020. This spike in activity is to be expected due to the upcoming halving, as well as a revival in widespread retail interest in bitcoin.\n\nBTC Active Entities Reaches Highest Point Since July 2019\n\nThe number of active entities (7d MA) in the Bitcoin network has spiked recently, reaching its highest point since the bull run of July 2019.\n\nNumber of active entities in the Bitcoin network (Glassnode Studio)\n\nThe active entities metric represents Bitcoin's active addresses, clustered to remove in-house transactions (i.e. it shows the number of individuals or businesses using the network, while filtering out double-ups if they are using more than one address).\n\nIts increase represents a change from the relatively lower levels of activity seen after the crash of March 2020, and may indicate new investors entering the market.\n\nAs global markets continue to see massive uncertainty and instability - and traditional \"safe haven\" assets such as oil plummet in price - BTC is becoming a more attractive asset, acting as a hedge against traditional financial markets.\n\nCommunity Insight\n\nContent and insights derived from Glassnode data by our community\n\nThe balance of BTC on BitMEX is down 32% since its top in March, as tweeted by @Unfolded using data from Glassnode Studio.\n\nBitMEX exchange balance down -31.9% since the 13th March top\n\nvia @glassnode pic.twitter.com/zf3v3WPLfX\n\n— Unfolded (@cryptounfolded) April 23, 2020\n\nWe recently reported on the decreasing balance of BTC across exchanges, a trend which appears to be continuing as we approach the next halving and users withdraw their assets for longer-term holding.\n\nStay updated on BTC Exchange Balances to keep watching this trend, and remember to send us your own content using Glassnode data to be featured in our next weekly update.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (1 Apr 2020 - 8 Apr 2020)\n\nAs BTC investors accumulate, the number of whales continues to grow, reaching 2-year highs and showing little sign of slowing down.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nApr 9, 2020 • 3 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin has continued to recover over the past week, moving back over the $7k mark on Monday and settling around $7300 - finally putting BTC back above the price at the start of 2020.\n\nOn-chain fundamentals have seen growth this week - especially volume, which saw a 23% increase since last week.\n\nHowever, when adjusting to remove in-house transactions by using entity-adjusted volume, we see that this increase only equates to 7.5%. This indicates that a portion of the increase in on-chain volume is coming from individuals and organizations moving BTC internally.\n\nDespite this, the total number of active entities has increased by 4.7%, indicating an increase in on-chain economic activity overall.\n\nNumber of BTC Whales At Highest Point in Over 2 Years as Investors Accumulate\n\nThe number of whales (i.e. entities with at least 1000 BTC) increased leading up to last month’s market crash, and accelerated during and after the crash. This suggests that larger market players are accumulating BTC, providing an optimistic sign.\n\n\nThe number of whales during an accumulation phase has not been this high since late 2015 (Glassnode Studio)\n\nThe number of whales hasn’t reached this level since the top of the market in late 2017. However, that figure was reached during a capitulation phase (i.e. when whales were selling).\n\nThe last time we saw this number of whales during an accumulation phase was in early 2016. This pattern becomes interesting when we compare it with the last halving event.\n\nWhales tend to accumulate BTC before supply decreases as a result of halving events\n\nThis trend implies that despite an uncertain market environment, whales remain confident that now is a good time to be accumulating BTC, suggesting that they believe there is further room for growth.\n\nCommunity Insight\n\nContent and insights derived from Glassnode data by our community\n\nIn a tweet this week, @ArcaneResearch used data from Glassnode to speculate on whether we have reached the bottom.\n\nMarket bottom in, or more blood to come?🧐\nThe on-chain metric Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) went below zero after the recent market crash.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (25 Mar 2020 - 1 Apr 2020)\n\nA series of on-chain metrics that typically highlight BTC market tops and bottoms have recently bounced out of zones that have historically signalled market bottoms.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nApr 2, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nOver the past week, BTC declined from the ~$6650 price point down to the range of $6100-6300, moving mostly horizontally but briefly dipping below $6k at one point. However, as of today, the price has recovered by over 5%, and is sitting above $6650 once again.\n\nOn-chain fundamentals continue to show a trend reversal from smaller numbers of large transactions (following the price drop), back to larger numbers of smaller transactions. This signals a return to normal trading activity following the larger movements seen in March as investors revised and consolidated their positions.\n\nThe increase in active addresses and entities also indicates more widespread network use, as opposed to the smaller numbers of big movers that were active during the capitulation phase following last month's price drop.\n\nThis return to normal network activity suggests that the panic triggered by the crash may have subsided, providing room for recovery. Other on-chain metrics also support this interpretation...\n\nOn-Chain Metrics Which Highlight Market Cycles Suggest a Change in Sentiment\n\nA series of on-chain metrics that typically highlight market tops and bottoms have recently bounced out of or currently sit in zones that have historically signalled bottoms and good entry points, indicating a potential shift towards more positive sentiment.\n\nWhen the price of bitcoin crashed in March, these metrics universally fell into the \"market bottom\" region, signalling that BTC was undervalued at those prices, and indicating a good time to buy. These metrics are now moving out of those lower ranges, suggesting that we may have seen the bottom.\n\nDashboard of metrics showing market tops & bottoms (Glassnode Studio)\n\nWhile unprecedented global events make it more risky to predict price movements based on historical trends, so far, these metrics appear to be providing sound signals.\n\nNet Unrealized Profit/Loss\n\nFor example, historically, Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) has fallen into the red (capitulation) zone when the market reaches a cyclical bottom.\n\nNUPL has consistently signalled market bottoms in the past (Glassnode Studio)\n\nIn the past, NUPL has stayed in this zone for at least a few months before recovering back to levels of hope and then optimism. However, it has never fallen into the red zone so close to a halving event before, providing hope that this ice age may not last as long as previous ones.\n\nLearn more about NUPL on Glassnode Academy to predict the upcoming trend for yourself.\n\nMVRV-Z Score\n\nThe MVRV-Z Score is used to assess when bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued relative to its \"fair value\". When it drops below zero, this signals that BTC is undervalued. Historically, this has proven true, as values below zero have represented market bottoms.\n\nMVRV-Z Score can be used to identify when BTC is undervalued (Glassnode Studio)\n\nThe value of MVRV-Z Score dropped below zero in late March for the first time since the late 2018/early 2019 bear market, signalling that the market had reached a bottom. Again, whether this bottom lasts as long as previous ones remains to be seen. Confounding factors such as the upcoming halving and the global economic state make this unpredictable.\n\nLearn more about MVRV-Z Score on Glassnode Academy to get ahead of this trend.\n\nCommunity Narrative\n\nContent and insights derived from Glassnode data by our community\n\nThe number of Bitcoin addresses holding at least 1 BTC continues to hit all-time highs, as observed by @Markchain_io.\n\nThis consistent uptrend is a positive sign for bitcoin, suggesting a wider spread of demand and adoption, as well as potential hodling behaviour.\n\nStay updated on the number of addresses holding at least 1 BTC to keep watching this trend, and remember to send us your own content using Glassnode data to be featured in our next weekly update.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (18 Mar 2020 - 25 Mar 2020)\n\nBitcoin experienced a historical downward difficulty adjustment this week. Along with the recent price rebound, will this be enough to bring miners back into the network?\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nMar 26, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin has experienced some relief from the lows of last week, recovering to well above the $6000 mark. If it can break past $7k, we may see prices recovering to levels seen at the beginning of 2020.\n\nOn-chain activity has seen decreases across the board as the price stabilizes and investors slow down with readjusting their portfolios.\n\nTransaction count has stayed relatively stable in relation to transaction volume, which has decreased significantly since last week. This implies that on-chain activity is returning to more regular levels, with transactions being of lower value on average.\n\nThis stands in contrast with activity over the last two weeks, during which we saw fewer transactions but of much larger value as investors responded to the rapid price decrease. This return to more normal activity suggests that the panic triggered by the price crash is dissipating.\n\nBitcoin Hash Rate Shows Signs of Recovering after Significant Downward Difficulty Adjustment\n\nBitcoin has experienced its second-largest decrease in difficulty ever; a massive 15.95% drop.\n\nThis occurred after many miners removed their hashing power from the network, facing unprofitability following the recent price crash.\n\nBitcoin Sees Largest Ever Decrease In Absolute Hashing Power\nBitcoin’s difficulty is set to experience one of its largest ever decreases as hashing power leaves the network. How will BTC respond to this?\nGlassnode Insights - On-Chain Market Intelligence\nLiesl Eichholz\n\nSince the network's difficulty readjusted, however, hash rate has started to bounce back, currently sitting at more than 10x higher than its lowest point yesterday (as can be seen on the hourly chart).\n\nWhat does this all mean for price? While some commentators say that large downward difficulty adjustments mark a bottom in the market, others believe the price will go down, saying the downward adjustment signals miner capitulation.\n\nHowever, given that miners are returning to the network now that mining has become easier, it appears that the recent hash rate decrease represented simple business-driven decision-making, rather than capitulation or lack of confidence.\n\nThat said, considering the uncertainty of the current economic state of affairs, the way the market and miners respond to this adjustment may not follow historical trends. Market participants should closely follow events and market data in this changing landscape in order to predict price movements.\n\nCommunity Narrative\n\nContent and insights derived from Glassnode data by our community\n\nRecent events, both on the global stage and in the context of the Bitcoin network itself, pose significant uncertainty as to where BTC is headed. Twitter user @xbt_blvrg used Glassnode Studio's implementation of SOPR to highlight this uncertainty.\n\nThe combination of the global economic crisis, COVID-19 pandemic, and recent miner and whale activity on the Bitcoin network means that predicting future price movements is harder than ever. However, we see in the tweet above that the recent crash has accelerated SOPR's cyclical decline.\n\nCould this mean an earlier rebound? Or are we headed further down before we see a meaningful recovery?\n\nStay updated on the SOPR metric to keep watching this trend, and remember to send us your own content using Glassnode data to be featured in our next weekly update.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

At its lowest point, bitcoin experienced a 50% drop from its price a month ago.\n\nHowever, we are seeing a rebound today, with BTC rising almost 16% in the last 24 hours and passing the $6k mark on many exchanges.\n\nMeanwhile, on-chain fundamentals are varied. Transaction volume is up almost 2x since the beginning of the year, signalling increased economic activity.\n\nFor the second week in a row, transaction count has decreased while volume has increased, suggesting that the average value of transactions is much higher than usual. This could signal both large sales as people attempt to minimize losses, and large purchases as investors buy the dip.\n\nHODLers Are Buying The Dip\n\nThe Hodler Net Position Change metric shows that long-term bitcoin holders are buying the dip.\n\nWhen this metric is above zero (green), it means that, on average, hodlers are accumulating BTC. When below zero, it means hodlers are selling (likely realizing profits).\n\nHodlers are using this dip as an opportunity to accumulate more BTC (Glassnode Studio)\n\nWe can see that this February, when prices approached $10k, hodlers stopped accumulating more BTC, potentially having identified it as a market top. However, during the crash last week, hodlers began accumulating, signalling confidence in BTC at this price point.\n\nLong-term investors appear have identified this as the bottom, which today's price increase supports.\n\nCommunity Narrative\n\nContent and insights derived from Glassnode data by our community\n\nUsing Glassnode data, based on our summary of the MakerDAO zero-bid exploit, @RyanSAdams pointed out the dangers of relying on nascent infrastructure for something as important as financial applications.\n\nBlack Thursday's DeFi stress test in a picture:\n\nDoes your protocol still work when gas prices look like this? pic.twitter.com/yoT1jD14X8\n\n— Ryan Sean Adams - rsa.eth (@RyanSAdams) March 17, 2020\n\nMany commentators have used this as an example of the fact that core blockchain infrastructure has far to go before it can be trusted to support critical financial functions (such as lending) at scale.\n\nRead the article for the full breakdown (and a TL;DR) of the exploit:\n\nWhat Really Happened To MakerDAO?\nBlack Thursday: The sell-off of 12 March resulted in $4.5 million of unbacked DAI in the MakerDAO system.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (4 Mar 2020 - 11 Mar 2020)\n\nDespite healthy on-chain fundamentals, BTC moves from gradual decline into freefall as coronavirus fears shake up markets globally.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nMar 12, 2020 • 3 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nBitcoin has fallen back down to $6k, in its worst day since 2017. Earlier today, the price dropped by 19% in a single hour as over half a billion USD worth of BTC longs were liquidated on BitMEX.\n\nOver the past week, we saw BTC recover briefly to above $9k after dropping into the $8200-8800 range the previous week. However, it quickly sunk back below $9000, and then below $8000. As of the publication of the table below (Wednesday 11 March), bitcoin was still in the high $7000s:\n\nBut on Thursday morning, crypto markets plummeted, with BTC reaching lows close to $5000 on some exchanges.\n\nBitcoin crashed below $5k on some exchanges on Thursday morning (data: CoinMarketCap)\n\nThis crash came after Trump announced a travel ban for those travelling from Europe into the US, but it is likely that a number of fears about coronavirus and its effect on the economy played a role.\n\nCurrent BTC price (Thursday 12 March): ~$6100\n\nAside from price movements, on-chain fundamentals have not experienced significant changes, and are all still up for the year.\n\nThis week, on-chain volume has experienced a notable increase, while the number of transactions has decreased - in other words, the average USD value per transaction has increased. This may suggest a shift from trading-based behaviour to buying and selling larger amounts as investors make decisions about whether or not to stay exposed to BTC.\n\nNet Unrealized Profit/Loss Falls into “Fear” Zone as Price Plummets\n\nBitcoin investor sentiment just crossed into the \"Fear\" zone according to Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL).\n\nNUPL represents the difference between unrealized profit and unrealized loss to determine whether the network as a whole is currently in a state of profit or loss. Values above zero indicate a state of net profit, so the current value of ~0.22 means that despite the price dump, the network is still in a state of profit.\n\nHowever, today's crash has taken this value significantly lower, well into the orange \"Fear\" zone. Historically, when this happens, NUPL usually drops all the way into the red \"Capitulation\" zone (net loss) before recovering to profitable levels.\n\nNUPL usually drops all the way down into the red zone after descending into the orange zone (Glassnode Studio)\n\nIf we don't see this value recovering soon, the market may take more significant losses before recovering into a state of net profit.\n\nMVRV Ratio: Bitcoin's Market Cap Approaches Parity with Realized Cap\n\nMVRV (market-value-to-realized-value) ratio is, as the name suggests, the ratio of an asset's market capitalization to its realized capitalization. By comparing these two metrics, MVRV can be used to get a sense of when price is above or below \"fair value\", thereby helping to spot market tops and bottoms.\n\nBitcoin's market cap is converging on its realized cap as the price decreases, bringing the asset closer to its \"fair value\" based on the average price when each coin was last moved. If MVRV falls below one, BTC will officially be \"undervalued\" as defined by this metric.\n\nThe question is whether the market will acknowledge this and rebound, or whether wider fears of economic turmoil will cause people to keep selling.\n\nStay tuned with data from Glassnode Studio.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (26 Feb 2020 - 4 Mar 2020)\n\nOn-chain fundamentals continue to paint an optimistic picture for bitcoin, as the price rallies back up over $9000.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nMar 5, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nFor the third week in a row, BTC suffered a price drop - however, it is showing signs of recovering over the past few days. Since the table below was published (Wednesday 4 March), the price of bitcoin has risen back above the $9k mark.\n\nCurrent BTC price (Thursday 5 Mar): ~$9100\n\nAlong with price, on-chain fundamentals also show signs of recovering, with the number of transactions and active entities in the network on the rise.\n\nWhile the 7-day moving average of on-chain USD volume appears to have decreased, this figure was brought down by the dip earlier in the week; absolute values (with no MA applied) are in fact on par with volumes seen a week and a month ago.\n\nLast week, we predicted a recovery for BTC, with a support level at $8200-8500. At its lowest point last week, the price dipped briefly below $8500 before settling back up around $8800, as predicted by on-chain data and technical analysis.\n\nWhile coronavirus fears threatened to push prices below this support level, this threat appears to have passed for the time being as markets recover both in and out of crypto.\n\nOutside of these short-term trends, there is ongoing debate about whether overall crypto market sentiment is bullish or bearish. On-chain metrics continue to paint an optimistic picture...\n\nReserve Risk Indicates Current BTC Price is Very Attractive Due to Low Risk/Reward Ratio\n\nBTC’s Reserve Risk is currently at low levels, indicating an attractive risk/reward ratio for investing in bitcoin. This metric, which is used to assess the confidence of long-term holders relative to price, shows high investor confidence in BTC at current price levels. Along with other on-chain fundamentals, it suggests that BTC has more room to grow imminently.\n\nReserve Risk is defined as the current price divided by HODL Bank, which represents deferred spending as a result of HODLing, demonstrating investor confidence. The attractiveness of the current BTC price (i.e. Reserve Risk) can be determined in relation to this sum total of confidence built over time.\n\nWhen confidence is high and price is low, there is an attractive risk/reward to invest (Reserve Risk is low). Current levels suggest that holding BTC is attractive at this price, and potential rewards outweigh the risks of entering the market now.\n\nLow ASOL Values Also Indicate Strong Investor Confidence\n\nASOL (Average Spent Output Lifespan) represents long-term investor confidence by showing when long-term HODLers are exiting the market. Historically, increases in this metric have come simultaneously to big sell-offs as long-term investors sell their positions.\n\nHistorically, high ASOL values have coincided with large sell-offs as long-term investors exit (Glassnode Studio: ASOL)\n\nClose market observers may have noticed a significant spike in ASOL over the past few days. However, this is no cause for alarm; Glassnode's data scientists have traced this spike to an exchange aggregating BTC \"dust\" (i.e. very tiny amounts of BTC spread across many addresses) from Omni transactions.\n\nWhen this activity is filtered out, ASOL levels remain low, supporting the thesis that long-term investors are not exiting their positions. Despite bitcoin's recent dip, confidence remains high.\n\nCommunity Narrative\n\nContent and insights derived from Glassnode data by our community\n\nThe whole crypto market has seen meaningful gains in 2020, and one of the best-performing assets is Kyber Network's KNC token, which has seen a radical +335% price increase since December 2019. Glassnode Studio user @Alex_Ged uses Glassnode's on-chain adaptation of the Herfindahl Index to illustrate why.\n\n4/ With staking on the horizon, more people are entering and accumulating KNC (Data as of Feb 29) pic.twitter.com/XF5zp1U5LY\n\n— Alex Gedevani 🧩 (@Alex_Ged) March 1, 2020\n\nThe Herfindahl Index measures addresses' shares of the current supply of a given token; a large score indicates high concentration of supply, whereas a small score is an indicator for more evenly distributed funds across addresses.\n\nIn his thread, Gedevani looks at KNC's decreasing Herfindahl Index value to show that KNC is becoming increasingly distributed, as more people enter the market and accumulate the token in anticipation of the launch of its staking mechanism this year, which will allow holders to receive a portion of network fees.\n\nHe points out: \"Adoption is still one of the most useful yet overlooked indicators in crypto\".\n\nView his twitter thread for the full analysis, and send us your own content using Glassnode data to be featured in our weekly update.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nThe Week On-Chain (19 Feb 2020 - 26 Feb 2020)\n\nDespite Bitcoin's price dropping back below $9000 in the wake of a market shake-up, on-chain fundamentals show that BTC is not overvalued.\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nFeb 27, 2020 • 4 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nAfter the downward correction last week, BTC has continued to drop in price. Since the table below was published (Wednesday 26 February), the price of bitcoin has decreased even further, dropping below $9k.\n\nCurrent BTC price (Thursday 27 Feb): ~$8800\n\nThis retrace coincides with some significant reductions in on-chain economic activity. USD volume, raw transaction count, and the number of active addresses/entities have all fallen in the past week, since bitcoin peaked above $10k.\n\nLast week we posed the question of whether we'd reached a local top and could expect a retrace, or whether we were looking at another upcoming rally. Although the price has continued to drop, last week's decrease in active entities has slowed to a halt, signalling a potential recovery in on-chain economic activity and providing hope for a rally in the coming weeks.\n\nThis is supported by analysts and backed by BTC's 200-day moving average, which suggest that the bullish trend of 2020 is not over - with the general consensus identifying support at the $8200-8500 level.\n\nHowever, traders are also preparing for the possibility that BTC may fall below $8000, at which point there are chances of an even stronger decline. Fears of the ongoing effect of coronavirus on markets (both traditional and crypto) make this possibility more likely, despite healthy fundamentals. Is there enough bullish sentiment to hold up prices, despite decreasing confidence in the market's ability to withstand the crisis?\n\nLet's see how market predictions stack up against on-chain metrics...\n\nBitcoin's MVRV Z-Score: More Room to Grow\n\nThe MVRV Z-Score is used to assess whether bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued relative to its \"fair value\", as underlined by its realized cap. When the metric is too high (red-zone), this usually indicates market tops, while a lower ratio (green-zone) indicates market bottoms.\n\nThe present low MVRV Z-Score suggests that BTC is still undervalued, with significantly more room to grow before reaching the next market top. This provides support for many analysts' prediction that bitcoin will stay above $8000 for the time being.\n\nReaders should continue to monitor the MVRV Z-Score to identify any potential trend changes early.\n\nShort-Term Investor Trends: BTC Still Undervalued, According to STH-MVRV\n\nShort Term Holder MVRV (STH-MVRV) is MVRV that takes into account the behaviour of short-term investors. This ratio provides a clean support/resistance line that correlates with upward and downward market trends.\n\nAs of 16 January this year, STH-MVRV (7-day MA) has climbed and remained comfortably above 1. Historically, this has correlated with uptrends in the price of BTC, suggesting fundamental support for higher prices. Barring any radical events that might affect confidence in the market, this metric suggests that BTC has room for more imminent growth.\n\nStay tuned on Glassnode Studio for the launch of STH-MVRV next week.\n\nCommunity Narrative\n\nContent and insights derived from Glassnode data by our community\n\nIn a compelling tweet thread, @caprioleio uses data from Glassnode Studio to support his bullish prediction: \"🚀Bitcoin $100K within 5 years\".\n\nWhere will this money come from?\n\nSupply Falling:\n\n👇40% of BTC is locked in wallets that have not moved their coin in >2 yrs.\n\n👇Bitcoin Inflation rate to halve in May & again in 4 years.\n\nBTC will be the lowest inflation asset ever known to man\n\nNote: HODL Wave pattern👀\n\n8/n pic.twitter.com/d9ZfpLd6sh\n\n— Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) February 16, 2020\n\nBased on estimates of Bitcoin's Energy Value, combined with evidence of demand increasing along with supply contracting, he predicts that the price of bitcoin will increase at least 10x over the coming years.\n\nOverall, despite unforeseeable events affecting price in the short-term, he believes that BTC fundamentals still paint an optimistic picture, and HODLers should remain confident.\n\nView his twitter thread for the full analysis, and send us your own content using Glassnode data to be featured in our weekly update.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

Have we reached a local top for the time being, or will BTC rally once again in the coming days?\n\nLiesl Eichholz\nFeb 20, 2020 • 2 min read\nBitcoin Market Health\n\nDespite passing the $10k mark again this week, the price of BTC has dropped since last week. Since the table below was published (Wednesday 19 February), bitcoin suffered a rapid price drop late on Wednesday evening, levelling out at ~$9500-9600 on Thursday morning and remaining there throughout the day.\n\nHave we reached a local top for the time being, or will BTC rally once again in the coming days? Looking at on-chain fundamentals, Bitcoin network activity this week has suffered stagnation and some meaningful decreases.\n\nParticularly interesting is the 16% drop in entity-adjusted transaction volume since last week. Entity-adjusted metrics filter out transactions in which BTC doesn't change hands, providing a clearer signal of actual economic activity.\n\nThe sharp decrease in this metric over the past week suggests that, at least on-chain, economic activity may be slowing down.\n\nHow do these fundamentals stack up against other on-chain metrics?\n\nBitcoin Active Entities Trending Upward in 2020: Will this Continue?\n\nThe number of unique active entities in the Bitcoin network has been on the rise in 2020, for the first time since the price peak in mid-2019. This is a potential sign that Bitcoin market participants are returning to the network, with more participants actively transferring BTC on-chain.\n\nHowever, despite the general up-trend in this metric, the past week has seen a decrease in active entities on-chain. Observed in the context of BTC’s rapid 6% price dip late on Wednesday, as well as the overall decrease in on-chain activity over the past week (as seen in the statistics above), this may trigger some concern.\n\nThat said, we saw a similar pattern in late January (a drop in active entities and price) before these both quickly recovered into an upward trajectory.\n\nCould this decrease in on-chain activity signify that we have reached a local top? Or is this just a brief dip, and will activity recover and continue to increase? Market observers should continue monitoring active entities and addresses to see if the general trend continues up.\n\nFollow us and reach out on Twitter\nFor on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio\nFor automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter\n\nDisclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

    "content": "The Week On-chain Newsletter\nGlassnotes Issue #2\n\nGlassnotes is a newsletter outlining the most recent on-chain market intelligence. It features analyses and commentary on the state of digital asset markets.\n\nGlassnode\nJul 4, 2019 • 6 min read\nIntroduction\n\nWelcome Glassnotes, your source of on-chain market intelligence, brought to you by Glassnode.\n\nGlassnotes gives you the most recent crypto network updates based on on-chain metrics, and features analyses and commentary on the state of the market to provide the fundamental insights you need to invest confidently in digital asset markets.\n\nSubscribe to Glassnotes to receive regular industry updates directly in your inbox.\n\nWeekly Ecosystem Updates\n\nThe raw on-chain data for these metrics are sourced from our Glassnode API. Further visualisations can be found on the Glassnode Studio.\n\n\n\nAsset Valuation Metrics\n\nValuation-based metrics take on-chain data and compare these with market data (such as price) to provide a clearer picture of the forces and trends driving the market.\n\n\n\nCore On-Chain Metrics\n\nCore on-chain metrics look at the health of a given network as a whole through the lens of activity and engagement happening on the blockchain itself.\n\n\n\nExchange Distribution\n\nThe flow of funds moving between exchanges and privately controlled wallets often highlights imminent market events.\n\n\n\nEcosystem Feature: Chainlink's Rise to the Top 20\nWhat is Chainlink?\n\nChainlink is a decentralised oracle network which allows Ethereum smart contracts to securely connect to external APIs, payment systems, and other data sources. To prevent the need for a trusted third party, multiple independent nodes collectively determine the accuracy of an external input before it is written into a smart contract.\n\nThe LINK token is used to pay node operators for retrieving data from off-chain feeds, formatting it into blockchain-compatible formats, and performing off-chain computation. It is also staked by node operators to guarantee uptime, correct data, and honest behaviour.\n\nRecent LINK Price Movements\n\nIn the past 3 months, LINK has risen from a low of $0.43 to a high of $4.54, an almost 10x increase. Despite a downward correction, the price is still well above previous levels at around $3.50.\n\nThese price levels are especially impressive when compared to LINK's performance during the January 2018 peak. The recent high of $4.54 on June 29 marked an all time high for LINK, more than 3.5 times its previous ATH of $1.28.\n\nLINK token ATH - January 2018 vs. June 2019 (source)\n\nA series of recent events involving Chainlink have contributed to these price increases:\n\nMay 30 - Chainlink launches on Ethereum mainnet.\nJune 13 - Google Cloud announces partnership with Chainlink.\nJune 27 - Coinbase Pro enables full trading capabilities for LINK.\nJune 28 - Coinbase retail exchange lists LINK token.\nLINK-related announcements and listings over the past month (source)\n\nMany commentators and media outlets are attributing this increase to the so-called \"Coinbase Effect\"; the phenomenon whereby an asset's value surges after it is listed on Coinbase.\n\nThis is supported by the rapid price increase occurring immediately after LINK was listed on Coinbase, as well as the fact that LINK has never seen this level of growth despite having been tradable on Binance and several other exchanges for nearly 2 years. However, the value of the Google Cloud partnership and general increased awareness of the Chainlink platform have likely also had a significant effect in increasing confidence in LINK.\n\nLINK Exchange Activity\n\nOver the past few months, the volume of LINK tokens on exchanges has hovered at around 12.5% of the total supply. Binance has consistently held over 90% of these tokens and accounted for a similar level of exchange trading volumes.\n\nIn the 3 days after the Coinbase listing, a total of 7,949,846 LINK (around 7% of all LINK on exchanges) moved off non-Coinbase exchanges (mostly Binance).\n\nGlassnode Studio: 1 month LINK balance on all exchanges (excluding Coinbase)\n\nAt the same time as LINK trading became available on Coinbase, the price increased rapidly, alongside significant withdrawals from Binance. Coinbase's wallet addresses are not publicly known, but the above correlations suggest that these outflows may represent people moving LINK onto Coinbase from Binance (and other exchanges).\n\nThis interpretation of the data would suggest that 5-10% of all LINK on exchanges is held on Coinbase (or Coinbase Pro). This correlates with Coinbase currently accounting for around 10% of LINK trading volumes.\n\nLINK Wallet Activity\n\nDuring the same 3 day time period outlined above, on-chain volumes totalled at 123,703,168 LINK.\n\nGlassnode Studio: 1 month on-chain LINK volume\n\nWhen apparent inter-exchange transfers (e.g. transfers from Binance to Coinbase) are excluded, this amounts to 115,753,322 LINK being transferred out of private non-exchange wallets; 14.6 times as much as the volume transferred between exchanges during the same time period.\n\nOne potential narrative is that this may represent users moving LINK from private wallets onto Coinbase. We know these tokens were not moved in meaningful volumes onto any other exchange, as shown by our exchange data above, but because Coinbase's hot and cold storage wallet addresses remain unknown, it is difficult to determine whether or not these volumes represent transfers onto Coinbase or other kinds of activity.\n\nHowever, it is unlikely such a high amount of early buyers or long-term holders with LINK in private wallets would be using an entry-level exchange like Coinbase, and Coinbase Pro volumes account for less than a third of this amount of LINK. The remainder of the volumes could potentially be explained by OTC trades, as supported by the large increase in receiving addresses during this time frame.\n\nGlassnode Studio: 1 month on-chain receiving addresses for LINK\n\nRegardless of the method of sale, it is likely that these funds moved out of private wallets as early buyers and long-term holders rushed to realise profits at the peak.\n\nChainlink Outlook\n\nThe recent Coinbase listing has exposed LINK to the market segment of non-technical investors, who have demonstrated clear demand but previously had little access to this asset. When the Chainlink platform becomes fully functional later this year, the utility value of the LINK token will become realisable, possibly increasing demand further.\n\nLINK's upcoming staking functionality also introduces the potential for decreased supply and velocity, as tokens will be locked up for extended periods of time while investors seek passive returns through staking.\n\nThe anticipation of increased demand and decreased supply could explain LINK's sudden rise to the top 20, becoming the highest valued non-exchange utility token.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we will be publishing a more detailed report on the fundamentals of LINK, including its wallet distribution and several other on-chain metrics.

This increase followed a continued upward linear trajectory, signalling an upcoming trend reversal almost 3 months before a meaningful BTC price increase was seen.\n\nAs another indicator, 5 days before the April 2019 price increase, active addresses started to increase even more rapidly, suggesting imminent upward price movement.\n\nHistorical data show that during sideways markets, sustained increases in active addresses may indicate an upcoming positive trend. During the “long winter” of 2015, active addresses increased linearly while price continued to move sideways. Following this, a sharp uptick in active addresses and then price occurred.\n\n\n\nSOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) Analysis\n\nAnother interesting lens through which to examine the price increase is the SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) metric, recently launched on Glassnode Studio. By comparing price with on-chain transaction data, it indicates when market participants are, on average, selling at a profit or a loss.\n\nRenato Shirakashi, who recently joined the Glassnode team, explained in a recent article how SOPR can help predict price corrections in both bull and bear markets.\n\nLooking at historical data, he examines how a SOPR value of greater than 1 in a bear market precipitates a sharp downward price correction, while a value of less than 1 in a bull market triggers an upward correction.\n\nLooking at more recent data, we see this trend continuing throughout the past 18 months. During this extended bear market, whenever SOPR rose over 1, the market reacted with a rapid downward correction. During these times, price is likely driven down due to increased supply as people rush to sell at break-even.\n\nSOPR can be used not only to predict rapid price movements in both bull and bear markets, but also to determine whether the market as a whole is bullish or bearish. The above trend shifted in April this year, indicating a trend reversal; SOPR broke above 1 for the first time in 4 months - and for the first time since the last bull market over a year ago, this event didn't trigger a sell-off.\n\nInvestors aware of this trend could have seen SOPR rise above 1 in April without triggering a price drop, and interpreted this as signalling an upcoming trend reversal. Anyone who bought at this time would have seen at least 160% gains, or 2.6x as of time of publication.\n\nThis early signal of a trend reversal was confirmed in late April this year when a drop in SOPR below 1 triggered a price increase. This occurred again in June, strongly suggesting that the overall trend has shifted; instead of scrambling to sell at break-even, BTC holders appear to be HODLing in anticipation of further price increases.\n\nIt should be noted that we can still expect to see a downward correction after this week's run, as the outsized returns will drive many people to sell. However, SOPR predicts that the overall trend remains positive; after a brief downturn, markets will likely continue to rise.\n\nAs we release more on-chain metrics, we will be able to demonstrate even more market trends that may reveal crucial insights for investors. Stay tuned, and subscribe to Glassnotes to receive these updates regularly.\n\nGlassnode Updates\nProduct Updates\nOur recent product launch includes the Glassnode API, Glassnode Studio, and Glassnode Insights.
