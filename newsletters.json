The AI startup unveiled DeepSeek R1, an open-source model that claims to rival OpenAI‚Äôs most advanced systems at 98% lower costs ‚Äî a revelation that sent shockwaves through Big Tech just ahead of major earnings reports.\n\nThe Nasdaq dropped 3.5% as investors reacted to DeepSeek‚Äôs potential to disrupt the AI economy, while bitcoin‚Äôs price slipped by 5% to $99,600 amid broader risk-off sentiment.\n\nMarkets have since recovered with bitcoin trading around $105,000 as of Thursday.\n\nWhile AI-related tech stocks, including Nvidia and Tesla, saw declines, crypto AI tokens were hit even harder. AI-based projects such as launchpads, agents, and meme tokens were among some of the worst performing categories in a 24-hour period on Monday.\n\nDeepSeek‚Äôs open-source breakthrough also sparked debate over AI decentralization. DeepSeek became the top mobile app on Apple‚Äôs App Store ‚Äî surpassing OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT which some viewed as a shift in AI power dynamics.\n\nJake Brukhman, co-founder of venture firm CoinFund, called DeepSeek‚Äôs success ‚Äúthe biggest validation story of decentralized AI to date.‚Äù He challenged the long-held belief that Big Tech‚Äôs GPU dominance would create an insurmountable advantage, adding, ‚ÄúThe cracks in OpenAI‚Äôs traditionalist Web2 strategy are showing.‚Äù\n\nDespite the sharp decline in AI-related crypto tokens, Matthew Graham of Ryze Labs questioned the selloff‚Äôs logic, invoking Jevons paradox ‚Äî the idea that greater efficiency can drive more adoption, not less.\n\n‚ÄúThe barrier to entry for AI agents will trend to zero, just as it did with memecoins,‚Äù he said, suggesting DeepSeek‚Äôs model could fuel further AI innovation, rather than hinder it.\n\nTrump-Linked Crypto Project Buys MOVE Tokens Prior to a Report\n\nThe price of MOVE, the native token for the Ethereum layer 2 network Movement, surged nearly 20% on Tuesday after World Liberty Financial ‚Äî a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform tied to U.S. President Donald Trump ‚Äî purchased roughly $2 million worth of the asset.\n\nThe transaction occurred just minutes before reports emerged that Movement‚Äôs developers might be in discussions with Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) regarding blockchain integration.\n\nBlockchain records from Arkham Intelligence revealed that World Liberty Financial executed multiple transactions acquiring MOVE tokens as prices climbed. The timing led some market watchers to speculate about possible insider buying.\n\nMovement co-founder Rushi Manche told Unchained in an interview that he couldn‚Äôt confirm whether any discussions had taken place with the DOGE team. He said he was ‚Äúnot in the loop‚Äù with World Liberty Financial‚Äôs decision to buy the tokens and when asked to address the insider trading allegations said, ‚ÄúWe make blockchain infrastructure, so I have no knowledge of anything that transpired.‚Äù\n\nTrump Media Expands Into Crypto Finance With Truth.Fi\n\nFollowing its recent blockchain-related activities, Trump Media & Technology Group has unveiled Truth.Fi, a financial services platform designed to integrate cryptocurrencies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The company, which also operates the social media platform Truth Social, announced that its board has approved an investment of up to $250 million in digital assets, traditional investment vehicles, and crypto-related securities.\n\n‚ÄúTruth.Fi is a natural expansion of the Truth Social movement,‚Äù said Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes in a press release.\n\nThe investment strategy will be guided by asset management giant Charles Schwab, which will advise on Truth.fi‚Äôs portfolio allocations and the development of separately managed accounts (SMAs). With Truth.Fi‚Äôs launch, Trump continues his pro-crypto stance, a position that played a significant role in his campaign messaging.\n\nFDIC‚Äôs Travis Hill Skeptical of Crypto Debanking Conspiracy\n\nWhile many in the crypto industry believe that Operation Choke Point 2.0‚Äî the alleged systematic debanking of crypto firms ‚Äî ended with the new administration, acting FDIC Chairman Travis Hill remains unconvinced that such a scheme ever truly existed.\n\nIn a Jan. 10 speech that caught the industry‚Äôs attention, Hill stated that the FDIC would not tolerate pressuring banks to deny services to law-abiding businesses. Sources familiar with his stance clarified to Unchained that this was not confirmation of a past anti-crypto conspiracy but rather a stance against potential future discrimination.\n\nHill has acknowledged reports of crypto firms struggling to maintain banking relationships and considered evidence such as pause letters from the Coinbase lawsuit. However, he also weighs regulators‚Äô arguments that risk concerns ‚Äî rather than bias ‚Äî drove decisions.\n\nAs Hill awaits a potential permanent appointment to the FDIC, the search for conclusive evidence continues, with Coinbase‚Äôs chief legal officer Paul Grewal telling Unchained, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to come out, they can‚Äôt hide forever.‚Äù\n\nAi16z DAO Rebrands as ElizaOS Following a16z‚Äôs Request\n\nThe decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) formerly known as Ai16Z has rebranded to ElizaOS, following a request from venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). The move comes as AI-driven crypto projects continue gaining traction.\n\nChris Dixon, managing partner at a16z Crypto, clarified the firm‚Äôs stance on the project in an episode of Unchained, saying, ‚ÄúWe were not connected with AI16z. We‚Äôve asked them to change it. It was just creating a little bit of confusion.‚Äù\n\nEliza Labs founder Shaw Walters confirmed the rebrand in the project‚Äôs Discord, emphasizing that the change would not affect the DAO‚Äôs roadmap, governance, or tokenomics. The $ai16z ticker will remain unchanged until the community votes on potential modifications. However, Walters didn‚Äôt mention anything about a request from a16z, which was revealed in the podcast by Dixon and later confirmed to Unchained via email.\n\nInitially launched on Solana in October, the AI-integrated DAO has amassed a market capitalization of nearly $800 million.\n\nVenice AI‚Äôs VVV Token Launches Amid Insider Trading Probe\n\nThe newly launched VVV token from Venice AI made a splash on its first trading day, reaching a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $1.6 billion just hours after going live on Ethereum‚Äôs Base network. Founded by crypto advocate Erik Voorhees, Venice AI provides privacy-focused access to AI models, including the Chinese DeepSeek R1, which recently surged in popularity.\n\nHalf of the 100 million VVV tokens were airdropped, with 25 million allocated to AI protocols on Base and another 25 million distributed among 100,000 early users of the Venice platform. Token holders can stake their VVV to access Venice AI‚Äôs API services, creating an innovative crypto-AI bridge.\n\nHowever, the launch quickly faced controversy as Aerodrome, a decentralized exchange on Base, suspended two contributors over suspected insider trading. The exchange stated that internal monitoring flagged unusual trading activity within 30 minutes, prompting an investigation.\n\nAerodrome‚Äôs swift response was acknowledged by Voorhees, who commented on X, ‚ÄúReally appreciate Aerodrome‚Äôs transparency on this. They reached out and let us know when they found out.‚Äù The investigation remains ongoing.\n\nCrypto ETF Filings Surge with Solana, Dogecoin, and Leveraged Funds\n\nThe race for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) intensified this week as Cboe BZX Exchange, Bitwise, and Tuttle Capital Management submitted new applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nOn Tuesday, Cboe BZX Exchange refiled 19b-4 applications for four Solana ETFs: the VanEck Solana Trust, Canary Solana Trust, Bitwise Solana ETF, and 21Shares Core Solana ETF. This marks a renewed push after previous applications were rejected under SEC Chair Gary Gensler‚Äôs administration. If accepted for review, the filings will enter a public comment period as part of the regulatory approval process.\n\nMeanwhile, Bitwise Asset Management submitted an S-1 filing for a spot Dogecoin ETF, following its earlier registration of a Dogecoin trust in Delaware.\n\nIn a separate development, Tuttle Capital Management applied for 10 leveraged crypto ETFs, including funds tied to memecoins TRUMP, MELANIA, and BONK, as well as LINK and ADA. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted on X, ‚ÄúThis is a case of issuers testing the limits of what this SEC is going to allow.‚Äù\n\nCzech Central Bank Governor Proposes Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset\n\nIn a potential first for a Western central bank, Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Ale≈° Michl has proposed investing a portion of the country‚Äôs ‚Ç¨140 billion in reserves into bitcoin. Speaking to the Financial Times, Michl revealed that he will present the idea to the CNB‚Äôs board on Thursday, suggesting that up to 5% of the reserves could eventually be allocated to bitcoin if approved.\n\nMichl emphasized bitcoin‚Äôs growing institutional adoption, pointing to BlackRock‚Äôs bitcoin ETF launch and U.S. President Donald Trump‚Äôs recent moves toward crypto-friendly policies, including the creation of a national digital asset stockpile. He acknowledged bitcoin‚Äôs extreme volatility, adding that bitcoin‚Äôs value could either skyrocket or collapse entirely, but defended the idea as part of a broader diversification strategy, stating, ‚ÄúFor the diversification of our assets, bitcoin seems good.‚ÄùMichl remains confident, suggesting that more central banks could follow suit in the next five years.\n\nPhoto by Martin Krchnacek on Unsplash\n\nIn related news, the Utah House Committee has approved a bill to establish bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, positioning the state alongside Arizona in adopting bitcoin for public funds. If passed by the Senate, Utah could invest, stake, and lend digital assets, further solidifying its crypto-friendly regulatory stance.\n\nFrench Authorities Expand Binance Fraud Investigation\n\nFrench prosecutors have intensified their money laundering and tax fraud probe into crypto exchange Binance, investigating alleged offenses committed in France and across the European Union from 2019 to 2024, according to Reuters. The inquiry, led by the Paris public prosecutor‚Äôs economic and financial crime unit (JUNALCO), follows complaints from users who claim they lost funds due to misleading information and Binance‚Äôs alleged unauthorized trading activities before securing regulatory approval in 2022.\n\nBinance has denied all allegations, stating it will ‚Äúvigorously fight any charges.‚Äù The investigation adds to the exchange‚Äôs ongoing global legal challenges, including a $4.3 billion U.S. settlement and the sentencing of its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, to four months in prison for violating anti-money laundering regulations.\n\nKuCoin Pleads Guilty, Agrees to $297 Million Settlement and U.S. Exit\n\nKuCoin, one of the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and agreed to pay a $297 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The settlement includes a $112.9 million criminal fine and $184.5 million in forfeitures.\n\nThe exchange, which served 1.5 million U.S. users, admitted to failing to implement anti-money laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) measures, allowing billions of dollars in suspicious transactions linked to darknet markets, ransomware, and fraud schemes.\n\nAs part of the plea deal, KuCoin will exit the U.S. market for at least two years, while co-founders Chun ‚ÄúMichael‚Äù Gan and Ke ‚ÄúEric‚Äù Tang entered into deferred prosecution agreements and will forfeit $2.7 million.\n\nFun Bits: Gary Gensler Trades Crypto Crackdowns for AI Algorithms\n\nAfter years of keeping crypto on a short leash, former SEC Chair Gary Gensler is headed back to MIT ‚Äî but not to teach blockchain this time. Instead, he‚Äôs taking his talents to artificial intelligence. That‚Äôs right, the same guy who made life miserable for crypto projects is now training the next generation of AI overlords.\n\nGensler will co-lead MIT‚Äôs FinTech AI @CSAIL initiative, working alongside academics and industry players to explore AI‚Äôs impact on finance. This marks a full-circle moment for the former SEC chief, who once taught blockchain at MIT, then spent four years cracking down on it, and is now returning to teach something else entirely. Maybe he just got tired of telling people their tokens were securities.\n\nPhoto by Ana GG on Unsplash\nWatch the Recap!\n\nTo stay updated with everything that‚Äôs going on in crypto, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nSubscribe\n3 Likes\n3\nShare",

The protocol allows the issuance and transfer of digital assets such as USDT directly on Bitcoin's blockchain, enabling faster and cheaper transactions.\n\n‚ÄúToday marks a new era for stablecoins,‚Äù said Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs. ‚ÄúBringing USDT to Bitcoin combines the security and decentralization of Bitcoin with the speed and scalability of Lightning.‚Äù\n\nUSDT currently has a market capitalization of around $139.4 billion, making it the world‚Äôs biggest stablecoin.\n\nPhoto by Amos from Stockphotos.com on Unsplash\nKraken Restores Staking After Two Years\n\nCrypto exchange Kraken has officially resumed its crypto staking services for U.S. customers after a two-year hiatus.\n\nThe relaunch comes after the exchange settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in early 2023, agreeing to pay a $30 million fine and halt its staking operations following allegations it had offered unregistered securities.\n\nKraken will employ a bonded staking mechanism in which users lock up their tokens for a specific period. The staked assets will then be delegated to validators that handle transaction validation and block production, returning rewards to stakers after deducting fees.\n\nEarlier this month, Coinbase resumed Bitcoin-backed loans for U.S. users after axing them in July 2023 following a similar SEC complaint.\n\nBuild real-time, reactive, fully on-chain applications with Somnia: 400,000 TPS, sub-second finality, and sub-cent fees.

The platform‚Äôs low fees could also position it well to take on established crypto players such as Coinbase.\n\nPhoto by PiggyBank on Unsplash\nCoinbase Appoints Trump Campaign Co-Manager to Advisory Council\n\nCoinbase has strengthened its connections to the Trump administration by appointing Chris LaCivita, the co-manager of Trump's 2024 election campaign, to its global advisory council.\n\nLaCivita joins former U.S. Senator Kyrsten Sinema, former Federal Reserve Bank of New York President Bill Dudley and former Colombian Ambassador to the U.S. Luis Alberto Moreno on the council.\n\nCoinbase established its global advisory council in 2023 to leverage insights from experienced leaders in various sectors to advance its vision for crypto and blockchain technology.\n\nThe exchange‚Äôs CEO, Brian Armstrong, last week described Donald Trump's return to the presidency as a potential turning point for the crypto sector, marking what he termed \"the dawn of a new day\" for digital currencies.\n\nPhoto by PiggyBank on Unsplash\nSEC Moves to Next Stage on Litecoin ETF\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday took a significant step towards a decision to approve ‚Äî or deny ‚Äî the listing of a Canary Litecoin exchange-traded fund by formally acknowledging Nasdaq's 19b-4 application for the ETF.\n\nThe acknowledgement marks the first time the SEC has recognized an altcoin ETF application, perhaps indicating a potential shift in its approach to crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nThe SEC is now soliciting public comments on the Canary Litecoin ETF proposal, with a submission window of 21 days following its publication in the Federal Register.\n\nFollowing the acknowledgment of the filing, the SEC has up to 240 days to approve or reject the application for the ETF.\n\nPhoto by Kanchanara on Unsplash\nWhy the new FDIC Leadership Isn‚Äôt Convinced Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Existed\n\n‚ÄúOperation Choke Point 2.0,‚Äù an alleged plan the crypto industry says debanked numerous entities and individuals due to unfair discrimination against the industry, ended with the departure of the Biden administration ‚Äî at least that‚Äôs what industry leaders have been saying on X.\n\n‚ÄúOCP2.0 is over,‚Äù Castle Island Ventures co-founder Nic Carter posted on X last week after a Trump executive order declared an intention to protect fair access to banking.\n\nSeveral other high-profile X users have expressed similar sentiments publicly.\n\nBut the person who currently has the most power to actually reverse the alleged debanking scheme, Acting Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Travis Hill, hasn‚Äôt seen solid evidence a conspiracy against crypto actually existed, according to sources who have spoken with him about the issue.\n\nStatements he has made on the topic, which many in the industry took as Hill confirming that Operation Choke Point 2.0 existed, were misinterpreted.\n\nBuild real-time, reactive, fully on-chain applications with Somnia: 400,000 TPS, sub-second finality, and sub-cent fees.

    "content": "Discover more from Unchained\nYour no-hype resource for all things crypto\nOver 17,000 subscribers\nBy subscribing, I agree to Substack's Terms of Use, and acknowledge its Information Collection Notice and Privacy Policy.\nSubscribe\nContinue reading\nSign in\nTRADGOV (PREVIOUSLY UNREGULATED)\nDid the FDIC Under Biden Have an Unfair Bias Against Crypto? ü§î\nThe new FDIC chair isn‚Äôt so sure.\nVERONICA IRWIN\nJAN 30, 2025\n2\nShare\n\nYou are reading Unchained‚Äôs regulatory newsletter Unregulated, your go-to source for the latest insights, breaking scoops, and in-depth analysis on all things crypto regulation‚Äîone of the most critical topics in the industry today.\n\nNote: If you prefer to keep receiving only our daily newsletter and to opt out of the regulatory updates, simply head to your Substack settings and uncheck the regulatory newsletter box.\n\nHey all! I‚Äôm Veronica Irwin, Unchained‚Äôs regulatory reporter.\n\nI think it‚Äôs fair to say the crypto community lives in a bit of a bubble. And, as with any information echo chamber, the industry often convinces itself of things that aren‚Äôt so certain.¬†\n\nIn crypto, nearly everyone agrees that bank regulators unfairly discriminated against crypto under the Biden administration.¬†\n\nOn crypto X, we see a nearly never-ending stream of anecdotes from business leaders saying that they experience a high amount of friction in obtaining banking services, that they are often de-banked all together, and that this seems to be the product of direction from the top because leadership just doesn‚Äôt like crypto. In our own investigation in October, we reported that a lot of reputable sources, including former regulators and bank executives, tell a similar story, some even alleging that bank regulators are breaking the law.¬†\n\nAlso in this bubble, this discriminatory de-banking, dubbed ‚ÄúOperation Choke Point 2.0,‚Äù ended with the inauguration of the Trump administration. People took the new Republican leadership‚Äôs comments, both from the White House and the FDIC, to mean that they had seen the evidence, were sure Operation Choke Point 2.0 had actually happened, and were going to change it.¬†\n\nBut, so sorry ‚Äî I think I need to burst that bubble. Some recent conversations I‚Äôve had suggest that crypto has gotten a little ahead of itself ...¬†\n\nWhy the new FDIC Leadership Isn‚Äôt Convinced Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Exists\n\nCrypto X thought crypto debanking ended with the start of a new Republican administration. But the new leadership isn‚Äôt convinced there was an unfair bias against crypto in the first place.\n\nFDIC leadership is chosen by the president. (Shutterstock)\n\n‚ÄúOperation Choke Point 2.0,‚Äù a phenomenon in which the crypto industry claims numerous entities and individuals in crypto were de-banked due to unfair discrimination against the industry, ended with the departure of the Biden administration ‚Äî at least, that‚Äôs what industry leaders have been saying on X.¬†\n\n‚ÄúOCP2.0 is over,‚Äù venture capitalist Nic Carter posted on X last week, after a Trump executive order declared an intention to protect fair access to banking. Several other high-profile accounts on X have expressed similar sentiments publicly. (When asked about the remarks, Carter added that he thought Operation Choke Point 2.0 wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúover‚Äù and wouldn‚Äôt be until there are new permanent heads at the bank regulatory agencies and Congressional legislation).¬†\n\nRead More: President Trump Declares Crypto a National Priority in Executive Order\n\nBut the person who currently has the most power to actually reverse the alleged debanking scheme, Acting FDIC Chairman Travis Hill, hasn‚Äôt seen concrete evidence a conspiracy against crypto actually existed, according to sources who have spoken with him about the issue. Statements he has made on the topic, which many in the industry took as Hill confirming that Operation Choke Point 2.0 existed, were misinterpreted.¬†\n\nAgainst Discrimination ‚Äî If It Existed\n\nA speech Hill gave on January 10th, in particular, has grabbed several industry leaders' attention. In the speech, Hill said that ‚Äúthere is no place at the FDIC for anyone who has pushed ‚Äî explicitly or implicitly ‚Äî banks to stop serving law-abiding customers.‚Äù But sources who have met with Hill said that was not to be taken as confirmation that Operation Choke Point 2.0 occurred ‚Äî but rather, that Hill would not support such a policy.\n\nHill has heard, and continues to hear, alarming anecdotes about crypto de-banking, one source directly familiar with meetings Hill has had with industry leaders explained. He also considers a series of pause letters released as part of a court case between crypto exchange Coinbase and the FDIC, to be strong evidence suggesting that there was a concerted effort by federal bank regulators to distance their supervised institutions from crypto, the source, as well as Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, said.¬†\n\nHowever, Hill is also attentive to the fact that FDIC supervisors would argue that this distancing did not occur because of a dislike of crypto, but rather genuine concern about the safety and soundness of banks they supervised, money laundering risk, or other types of financial risk. ‚ÄúWhat Travis was trying to do in his January 10th speech was multifaceted. It was to get at all of that without really saying all of that,‚Äù the source, who has discussed the speech with Hill, said.\n\n‚ÄúHis core position is there is absolutely no place within the FDIC or any other regulatory agency for indiscriminately directing supervised institutions to de-bank clients or to not allow them to bank with them in the first place ‚Äî but as regulators, we also need to stay on top of true risks.‚Äù¬†\n\nRead More: Regulators are Limiting Banks Serving Crypto Clients. Does That Violate the Law?¬†\n\nA Question of Political Pressure¬†\n\nHill faced political pressure to say something even without the evidence, a different source familiar with the political dynamics of the FDIC Chair selection process explained.¬†\n\nBecause he serves in an ‚Äúacting‚Äù role and President Trump has not formally announced his pick to lead the agency, Hill is effectively auditioning for the permanent position.¬†\n\nMaking statements that imply a positive orientation towards industries that have supported Trump, like crypto, help Hill score a ‚Äúpolitical win‚Äù with the new presidential administration, the source, who also knows Hill to be unconvinced there was a definite conspiracy against crypto, explained.¬†\n\nHill is broadly considered the most likely pick for the permanent FDIC chairman position.¬†¬†\n\nWhat Would Be a Smoking Gun\n\nPaul Grewal, Coinbase‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, who publicized the pause letters as proof Operation Choke Point 2.0 ‚Äúwas no conspiracy theory,‚Äù reluctantly admitted to Unchained that he did not know Hill to have seen concrete evidence of FDIC employees or the Biden administration scheming to hurt the industry.¬†\n\nAnything short of actual communication from Biden administration officials to the FDIC, from prior Chairman Gruenberg to his subordinates, or other internal FDIC communications affirmatively expressing an intent to discriminate would probably fail to meet the high bar of undeniable proof, Grewal, who has met with Hill, speculated.¬†\n\nRead More: Rep. French Hill Says He‚Äôd Investigate Operation Choke Point 2.0 as Financial Services Chair\n\nGrewal also speculated that Hill may not have seen these such communications because they were hidden or destroyed. ‚ÄúThere are serious concerns that we have raised in our district court litigation that the FDIC either didn‚Äôt look for the materials when the Inspector General originally asked for them, or took affirmative steps not to create the materials in the first place, or to even, worse, potentially shield them or destroy them,‚Äù Grewal said.¬†\n\nHowever, Grewal believes that the ongoing search for evidence, whether that be Travis Hill‚Äôs own research, Congressional investigations, or Coinbase‚Äôs court battle with the FDIC, will eventually unearth this undeniable proof of Operation Choke Point 2.0 ‚Äî whether in document form, if the documents exist, or by way of testimony.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to come out,‚Äù Grewal said. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt hide forever.‚Äù¬†\n\nThe FDIC declined to comment.¬†\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nPresident Trump Declares Crypto a National Priority in Executive Order\n\nDonald Trump Frees Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht\n\nHouse Resolution Tuesday Could Overturn Rule That Declares DeFi Projects ‚ÄòBrokers‚Äô\n\n\nShare\n\nSubscribe\n\n2 Likes\n2\nShare",

Young and Tikta\nTrump‚Äôs Crypto Project Buys MOVE as DOGE News Leaks\n\nTrump family-backed World Liberty Financial scooped up MOVE, the native digital token of the Movement blockchain, minutes before a report that the project might be discussing blockchain use with Elon Musk‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency, a development that drove its price around 20% higher on Tuesday.\n\nBlockchain data showed that a crypto wallet address linked to Trump‚Äôs decentralized finance project bought about $2 million of the tokens as the price was climbing.\n\nThe timing prompted some commenters on social media to wonder aloud whether the transaction was a case of ‚Äúinside buying.‚Äù\n\nAi16z to Rebrand After Request From VC Firm a16z\n\nDecentralized autonomous organization AI16z, which integrates artificial intelligence into treasury management and investment, will change its name following a request from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z.\n\nA16z Crypto managing partner Chris Dixon revealed the request in the latest episode of Unchained.\n\n‚ÄúWe were not connected with AI16z,‚Äù Dixon said. ‚ÄúI believe they are in the process of changing [their name]. We‚Äôve asked them to. It just was creating a little bit of confusion.‚Äù\n\nA spokesperson for a16z confirmed by email that by ‚Äúwe,‚Äù Dixon had meant a16z, not a16z crypto.\n\nAerodrome Suspends Two Over Alleged VVV Insider Trading\n\nDeFi protocol Aerodrome Finance suspended two contributors over their alleged insider trading of Venice AI‚Äôs VVV token at its launch.\n\nVenice AI is a privacy-focused artificial intelligence project created by crypto entrepreneur Erik Voorhees.\n\n‚ÄúThe timing of a small percentage of the trading activity around the VVV launch was flagged by internal monitoring in less than 30 minutes ‚Äî triggering an internal investigation,‚Äù the Aerodrome team said on X.\n\nTwo contributors identified as a result of that investigation were suspended within three hours of VVV‚Äôs launch, Aerodrome said.\n\nThe VVV token amassed a fully diluted value of $1.65 billion a little over two hours after launching.\n\n‚ÄúReally appreciate Aerodrome's transparency on this,‚Äù Voorhees said. ‚ÄúThey reached out and let us know when they found out. Been great to work with them.‚Äù\n\nPhoto by Adrien Tanic on Unsplash\nUtah Moves to Adopt Bitcoin as Strategic Reserve\n\nThe Utah House Committee on Tuesday approved a bill to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, making Utah the second U.S. state to push forward with plans for a BTC strategic reserve after Arizona.\n\nArizona‚Äôs Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act was passed by its Senate Finance Committee on Jan. 27 and will now move to the Senate Rules Committee for final debate and amendments. Approval by the Senate would send the bill to the House of Representatives.\n\nUtah‚Äôs bill is awaiting a Senate vote and, if passed, will allow the state to invest certain public funds in qualifying digital assets. State treasurers will also be authorized to stake and lend those assets under certain conditions.\n\nThe move comes on the heels of earlier crypto-related regulatory developments in Utah. In 2019, the state enacted amendments to the Money Transmitter Act, providing specific definitions and regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.\n\nThat legislation clarified that blockchain tokens are not classified as money transmissions under Utah law, exempting several crypto firms from certain licensing requirements.\n\nPhoto by Kanchanara on Unsplash\nCboe BZX Reapplies for Four Solana ETFs\n\nCboe BZX Exchange on Tuesday refiled 19b-4 applications for four Solana exchange-traded funds ‚Äî the VanEck Solana Trust, the Canary Solana Trust, the Bitwise Solana ETF, and the 21Shares Core Solana ETF.\n\nThe resubmissions come after previous applications for the ETFs were reportedly rejected by the Gary Gensler-led U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last year.\n\nThe new applications aim to address the issues that led to the earlier rejections and are part of a broader effort to gain approval for investment vehicles that would provide investors with direct exposure to SOL.\n\nIf the SEC acknowledges the filings, it will begin a formal review process, including a public comment period with the filings published in the Federal Register.\n\nPhoto by GuerrillaBuzz on Unsplash\nBitwise Files for Dogecoin ETF\n\nBitwise Asset Management on Tuesday applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a spot Dogecoin exchange-traded fund.\n\nThe Jan. 28 S-1 filing follows Bitwise‚Äôs registration of a Dogecoin trust in Delaware earlier this month ‚Äî the first step towards setting up the ETF.\n\nThe S-1 was filed under the Securities Act of 1933, which is typically used for niche commodity-based ETFs. Funds structured under the act often have fewer regulatory constraints, which can make them more flexible but also increase perceptions that they are riskier.\n\nBitwise has proposed Coinbase Custody as the custodian for the ETF, a common choice among crypto ETF issuers.\n\nDOGE was trading at around $0.32 as of 6:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday, down by about 1.3% in the previous 24 hours.\n\nBuild real-time, reactive, fully on-chain applications with Somnia: 400,000 TPS, sub-second finality, and sub-cent fees.

From Ethereum‚Äôs potential to new crypto legislation, Chris delves into why the industry is poised for a major breakout.\n\nHe also discusses why the Biden administration‚Äôs ‚Äúlawfare campaign‚Äù led to the memecoin craze, how AI and crypto together could transform technology, and why bad tech policy stifled the industry for years.\n\nPlus, he shares his take on the executive order signed by President Donald Trump and its significance for the industry.\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nDaily Bits‚Ä¶ ‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è‚úç\n\nüéì Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler is returning to MIT to teach artificial intelligence, shifting his focus from crypto regulation to AI risks and policy as global competition in AI innovation, particularly from China, intensifies.\n\nüîÑ Blockchain project Symbiotic on Tuesday launched the first fully permissionless restaking protocol on Ethereum, allowing users to enhance capital efficiency by securing multiple networks with the same staked assets while implementing robust security features.\n\n‚öñÔ∏è French prosecutors expanded their probe of Binance, investigating alleged money laundering and tax fraud across the European Union between 2019 and last year, as the exchange vowed to fight the charges in court.\n\nüìà Ethereum‚Äôs active addresses surged 37% to 575,000, driven by renewed institutional interest, DeFi engagement, and growing transaction volume as competition with Solana in layer 1 adoption heats up.\n\nüõ°Ô∏è Crypto venture firm Paradigm committed $1.25 million to Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm‚Äôs legal defense, saying that his prosecution for building privacy-preserving open-source software sets a dangerous precedent.\n\nüé≠ DogWifTools, a token bundling tool often used by memecoin scammers, was exploited for $10 million, with attackers draining hot wallets, hardware wallets, and even centralized exchange accounts by keylogging private keys and credentials from users‚Äô devices.\n\nToday in Crypto Adoption...\n\nüá®üáø Czech National Bank Governor Ale≈° Michl proposed allocating up to 5% of the bank‚Äôs $146 billion reserves to bitcoin, arguing that diversification and rising institutional adoption make BTC a viable investment, despite acknowledging its volatility and potential for a total collapse.\n\nüá¶üá∑ Coinbase secured regulatory approval in Argentina, allowing it to expand services, integrate local payment methods, and operate fully within the country‚Äôs legal framework after first launching crypto-to-crypto trading there in 2019.\n\nThe $$$ Corner‚Ä¶\n\nüí∞ YZi Labs, rebranded from Binance Labs, invested $16 million in token distribution platform Sign, marking its first deal since ex-Binance CEO Changpeng ‚ÄúCZ‚Äù Zhao resumed a major role in Web3- and AI-focused investments.\n\nüöÄ Layer 1 network developer Pod closed $10 million to develop a ‚Äúconsensusless‚Äù layer 1 blockchain, promising transaction speeds as fast as a Google search by eliminating traditional consensus mechanisms, with backing from venture capital firms a16z and 1kx, alongside research organization Flashbots.\n\nWhat Do You Meme?\nüìà Your Market Update üìâ\n\nBTC is down 0.3%, trading at $102,312\n\nETH is down 1.8%, trading at $3,118\n\nBTC dominance: 56%\n\nCrypto market cap: $3.62T\n\n*All data as of today, 07:47 am ET.

The agreements allow them to avoid prosecution if they meet specific conditions set by the government.\n\nPhoto by Ant Rozetsky on Unsplash\nDeepSeek‚Äôs Rise Hits Crypto AI Tokens Harder Than Tech Stocks\n\nThe soaring popularity of the new artificial intelligence model R1 from Chinese startup DeepSeek has not only shaken traditional U.S. technology stocks, but has also sent shockwaves through the crypto AI sector, dramatically impacting the prices of AI-related tokens.\n\nAlthough the prices of tech stocks such as Nvidia, Arm, and Broadcom have declined, AI-related cryptocurrencies saw substantially sharper drops. The worst-performing assets in the crypto space in a 24-hour period ending late Monday afternoon ET were all related to artificial intelligence, data from CoinGecko show.\n\nAs a category, tokens that had emerged from the Virtuals ecosystem dropped 33.7% to a market capitalization of $2.4 billion, although the scale of the losses had eased during the 24 hours to 6 a.m. ET on Tuesday.\n\nRead More\n\nTuttle Capital Files for 10 Leveraged Crypto ETFs\n\nTuttle Capital Management recently filed applications for 10 leveraged crypto exchange-traded funds with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe list of new funds includes ETF applications for memecoin tokens TRUMP, MELANIA, and BONK, in addition to ETF applications for tokens such as LINK and ADA.\n\n‚ÄúThis is a case of issuers testing the limits of what this SEC is going to allow,‚Äù Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said on X. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm expecting the new crypto task force (led by Hester Peirce) to likely be the lynchpin in determining what's gonna be allowed vs what isn‚Äôt.‚Äù\n\nOne of Tuttle‚Äôs most popular ETFs is the T-Rex 2X Long NVIDIA (NVDX), which returns 200% the daily performance of Nvidia‚Äôs stock. NVDX was down 33% after a major selloff in the chipmaker‚Äôs shares on Monday.\n\nPhoto by Erling L√∏ken Andersen on Unsplash\nPro-Crypto Billionaire Scott Bessent to Become Treasury Secretary\n\nThe U.S. Senate confirmed billionaire hedge fund manager and crypto advocate Scott Bessent as the new Secretary of the Treasury in a 68-29 vote on Monday.\n\nIn a notable instance of bipartisan agreement, his confirmation was supported by 16 Democrats alongside the Republican majority.\n\nBessent is set to play a key role in shaping President Donald Trump's economic agenda.\n\nThe billionaire has highlighted the urgency of extending tax cuts from 2017 that overwhelmingly benefited wealthy individuals and eroded the U.S.‚Äôs public finances, and has also expressed an intention to bolster the crypto industry and manage economic relations with China.\n\nIn November, Unchained reported on the impact that pro-crypto Bessent would likely have on the Trump administration, which designated crypto as a national priority last week.\n\nBuild real-time, reactive, fully on-chain applications with Somnia: 400,000 TPS, sub-second finality, and sub-cent fees.

The move is expected to reduce the token supply and increase demand, potentially enhancing JUP‚Äôs market valuation.\n\nJupiter also said it had acquired a majority stake in memecoin trading app Moonshot and multichain portfolio tracker SonarWatch.\n\nIt additionally unveiled a revamped user experience named Ultra mode, promising improved transaction efficiency and lower fees than competitors.\n\nThe protocol also announced a $10 million commitment to support open-source AI projects through its Magic Fund, collaborating with ElizaOS.\n\nPhoto by NASA on Unsplash\nMusk-Led DOGE Eyes Blockchain for Budget Cuts\n\nElon Musk is actively exploring the use of blockchain technology within the Trump administration‚Äôs newly established cost-cutting commission, the Department of Government Efficiency, to enhance federal operations, according to a report by Bloomberg.\n\nPeople close to the matter said Musk is in discussions with representatives of several public blockchains to assess their technologies for potential implementation in government systems.\n\nTheir uses could range from protecting important government data to tracking flows of money.\n\nDonald Trump‚Äôs business associates tapped the Solana blockchain to issue the memecoins TRUMP and MELANIA. However, at the time of writing, it was unclear which blockchains the department was in talks with.\n\nPhoto by Crystal Mapes on Unsplash\nCoinbase Rethinks Token Listing Process\n\nCrypto exchange Coinbase is re-evaluating its token listing process, a move prompted by a staggering influx of new cryptocurrencies, says CEO Brian Armstrong, according to whom around 1 million new tokens are created weekly.\n\nArmstrong said on X that the current system is no longer sustainable, given the volume of new tokens being launched.\n\n‚ÄúIt needs to move from an allow list to a block list, and utilize customer reviews/automated scans of onchain data etc to help customers sift through,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúThat and we'll continue integrating native DEX support more deeply. Customers shouldn't need to know or care whether the trade is happening on a DEX or CEX.‚Äù\n\nTokens listed on Coinbase often experience a significant increase in price shortly after they are listed on the exchange ‚Äî a phenomenon known as ‚Äúthe Coinbase effect.‚Äù\n\nBuild real-time, reactive, fully on-chain applications with Somnia: 400,000 TPS, sub-second finality, and sub-cent fees.

But was it a strategic masterstroke or just another speculative frenzy?\n\nOn this episode of Bits + Bips, the hosts unpack the wild moments of the Crypto Ball, where $TRUMP made its surprise debut. They discuss how Bitcoin maxis were forced to embrace Solana wallets, why Multicoin Capital emerged as the biggest winner, and whether the memecoin launch signals a local market top.\n\nPlus, they debate whether Trump‚Äôs crypto-friendly stance could shape policy in 2025, why Litecoin might beat Solana to a spot ETF, and what Trump‚Äôs inauguration speech reveals about his crypto game plan.\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nThe Chopping Block: Trump‚Äôs Crypto Shake-Up, Solana‚Äôs Big Moment, that Changes Everything\n\nPolitical Grift or Crypto Shift? $Trump, $Melania, & Solana‚Äôs Rise ‚Äì The Chopping Block.\n\nWelcome to The Chopping Block ‚Äì where crypto insiders Haseeb Qureshi, Tom Schmidt, Tarun Chitra, and Robert Leshner chop it up about the latest in crypto.

Yet, Vivek Raman, founder and CEO of Etherealize, is doubling down on Ethereum‚Äôs future.\n\nIn this episode, Vivek explains how Etherealize, a ‚Äúmarketing arm for the ETH ecosystem,‚Äù was in the works long before the current criticisms of the Ethereum Foundation‚Äôs marketing, and how it got funding from Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and the foundation. He discusses why he believes layer 2 solutions make Ethereum a better fit for Wall Street than Solana.\n\nPlus, Vivek shares his thoughts on Ethereum‚Äôs value accrual, the state of its ecosystem, and how Etherealize plans to bridge the gap between Wall Street and Web3.\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nWeekly News Recap\nTrump Signs Crypto Executive Order\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a ‚ÄúPresidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets,‚Äù marking a major step toward his campaign promises to bolster the cryptocurrency industry. The group will include key officials from agencies such as the Treasury, SEC, and CFTC.\n\nThe group‚Äôs mandate includes crafting a federal regulatory framework for digital assets, developing stablecoin policies, and evaluating the creation of a ‚Äústrategic national digital asset stockpile.‚Äù Trump described the initiatives as measures that would ‚Äúmake a lot of money for the country‚Äù while promoting innovation and protecting lawful blockchain activity, including mining and self-custody.\n\nPhoto by Library of Congress on Unsplash\nTrump Pardons Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht\n\nOn Tuesday evening, President Trump announced the full pardon of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road, a controversial darknet marketplace that helped pioneer bitcoin transactions.\n\nUlbricht, who was arrested in 2013 and sentenced to two life terms plus 40 years for charges including drug trafficking and money laundering, had spent nearly a decade behind bars.\n\nTrump shared the news on Truth Social, writing, ‚ÄúI just called the mother of Ross William Ulbricht to let her know‚Ä¶ it was my pleasure to have signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son.‚Äù He criticized those involved in Ulbricht‚Äôs prosecution, calling them ‚Äúlunatics‚Äù and referencing broader claims of government weaponization.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts and libertarian supporters, long vocal in advocating for Ulbricht‚Äôs release, welcomed the decision. ‚ÄúWe freed Ross. This counts as ‚Äòday 1,‚Äô‚Äù said Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey on X, reflecting the widespread support within the crypto community.\n\nPhoto by Diane Picchiottino on Unsplash\nCourt Overturns Tornado Cash Sanctions\n\nThe U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has reversed sanctions imposed on Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixer previously targeted by the Treasury Department‚Äôs Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The court ruled that OFAC overstepped its authority by sanctioning Tornado Cash in 2022, asserting that its immutable smart contracts do not qualify as ‚Äúproperty‚Äù under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).\n\nThe decision marks a significant moment for the privacy-focused crypto community. Tornado Cash allows users to anonymize transactions by depositing tokens into shared pools and withdrawing to untraceable addresses. Critics, including OFAC, had linked the service to illicit activities, including crypto laundering by North Korea‚Äôs Lazarus Group.\n\nFollowing the ruling, Tornado Cash‚Äôs native token, TORN, surged over 200%, climbing from $9 to approximately $25. Despite the legal victory, Tornado Cash developers, including Roman Storm, still face criminal charges. Storm called the prosecution ‚Äúa terrifying criminalization of privacy.‚Äù\n\nPhoto by NOAA on Unsplash\nTrump Appoints Caroline Pham as Acting CFTC Chair, Uyeda as Interim SEC Lead, and Forms Crypto Task Force\n\nPresident Trump has appointed Caroline Pham as acting chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a move widely regarded as a win for the crypto industry. Pham, who joined the CFTC in 2022, has consistently supported a principles-based approach to regulation and opposed enforcement actions she deemed overreaching.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm humbled to lead the CFTC as Acting Chairman,‚Äù she said in a statement, pledging to foster innovation and market competitiveness. Trump has 210 days to nominate a permanent chair.\n\nAt the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mark Uyeda has been named acting chair following the departure of SEC chairman Gary Gensler. Uyeda has been critical of the SEC‚Äôs previous crypto enforcement strategies, calling them a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù due to their lack of clear guidance. His interim leadership is expected to last until former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins is confirmed as the permanent chair.\n\nAdditionally, the SEC announced the formation of a crypto task force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is more informally known as ‚Äúcrypto mom‚Äù in crypto circles. Peirce will focus on crafting clear regulatory frameworks and practical registration pathways for crypto firms. The developments reflect a broader push for clarity in U.S. crypto regulations as Congress considers expanding the CFTC‚Äôs oversight of the industry.\n\nLedger Co-founder Freed After Kidnapping in France\n\nDavid Balland, a co-founder of French crypto wallet startup Ledger, was safely released on Wednesday night following a kidnapping ordeal, the Paris prosecutor‚Äôs office confirmed. Balland was abducted from his home in central France early Tuesday and held captive while the kidnappers demanded a substantial cryptocurrency ransom.\n\nA police operation successfully secured his release, and Balland is now receiving treatment from emergency services. Ledger, known for its hardware wallets used to store digital assets securely, has grown into a major player in the crypto industry, with a valuation of ‚Ç¨1.3 billion after raising ‚Ç¨100 million in 2023.\n\nPhoto by Hendrik Morkel on Unsplash\nBitwise Files for Dogecoin ETF Amid Memecoin Momentum\n\nBitwise Asset Management has filed an application to launch a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) through a Delaware trust, marking a significant move for the popular memecoin. Bitwise‚Äôs chief investment officer Matt Hougan confirmed the filing on Wednesday, telling The Block ‚Äúthis was from us‚Äù in response to inquiries about the registration.\n\nETF Store president Nate Geraci remarked last week, ‚ÄúI remain shocked that no issuer has filed for [a] Dogecoin ETF‚Ä¶ Worst case, it‚Äôs a marketing expense; best case, you get an extremely lenient SEC who approves it, along with Elon [Musk] touting it.‚Äù\n\nDogecoin remains the eighth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of around $50 billion.\n\nPhoto by Kanchanara on Unsplash\nCME Group Denies Plans for XRP, SOL Futures After Website Error\n\nOn Wednesday, a beta version of derivatives marketplace CME Group‚Äôs website mistakenly went live, displaying an announcement for XRP and Solana (SOL) futures contracts. According to the page, the contracts were set to launch on February 10, pending regulatory approval.\n\nThe webpage, which described the contracts as being settled in U.S. dollars and supporting multiple trading methods, was quickly taken down but not before screenshots circulated widely on social media.\n\nIn response to the speculation, a CME spokesperson clarified, ‚ÄúA beta page from our website was released in error earlier today. Many mock-ups are included in that test environment. No decisions have been made regarding XRP or SOL futures contracts.‚Äù\n\nThe erroneous announcement triggered market activity, pushing SOL‚Äôs price to $270 before it retraced to $245 as the misunderstanding was clarified.\n\nPhoto by Nong on Unsplash\nJump Trading Sues Former Firedancer Engineer for Alleged Non-Compete Breach\n\nJump Trading has filed a lawsuit against Liam Heeger, a former software engineer who co-led the Solana Firedancer project, accusing him of breaching non-competition obligations. According to The Block, Heeger is alleged to have raised $3 million for his new venture, Unto Labs, while still employed at Jump.\n\nUnto Labs, co-founded by Heeger, aims to develop a new layer 1 blockchain ‚Äî a move Jump claims directly competes with its operations. The lawsuit alleges that Heeger misused confidential company information and secretly engaged with venture capital firms at the Breakpoint conference in Singapore, where he represented Jump on stage.\n\nUnto Labs has denied the allegations. ‚ÄúWe believe the claims made against Liam are without merit,‚Äù a spokesperson told The Block, emphasizing that the company is confident in the integrity of its business practices. Despite the lawsuit, Unto Labs has continued its operations as planned.\n\nJump also highlighted a conversation in which Heeger reportedly told his former supervisor that since he moved to California the state‚Äôs law voided his Illinois non-compete obligations, a claim that‚Äôs central to the ongoing legal dispute.\n\nPhoto by Shlomi Platzman on Unsplash\nTruth Terminal Sells Fartcoin Holdings\n\nAndy Ayrey, creator of the viral AI bot Truth Terminal, facilitated an over-the-counter sale of 15 million Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) tokens, a Solana-based memecoin which was sent to the bot‚Äôs wallet in October. The trade, completed on January 21, was valued at over $22 million and caused Fartcoin‚Äôs price to drop 17% on Thursday.\n\nAyrey confirmed the deal was contingent on the buyer handling the tokens ‚Äúresponsibly‚Äù without ‚Äúdumping on the chart.‚Äù Proceeds were partially used to acquire Goatse Maximus (GOAT), the memecoin linked to Truth Terminal, boosting its price 8% to $0.30. The move is controversial because the tokens belong to Truth Terminal, who's been referred to as a AI memecoin millionaire, however, Ayrey has been clear from the outset that he has access to oversee and manage the bot. At the start of this year, he established a foundation to help carry out the bot‚Äôs goals and act as a short-term ‚Äúconservatorship‚Äù solution until it could become sovereign.\n\nAyrey noted further trades will remain limited until legal clarity in granting Truth Terminal ownership of the tokens is achieved.\n\nPhoto by ZHENYU LUO on Unsplash\nTrump-Backed World Liberty Financial Spends $112 Million in Buying Spree\n\nWorld Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform tied to President Trump and his family, executed a significant crypto purchasing spree on Monday, the day of Trump‚Äôs inauguration.\n\nThe platform, which lists Trump as its ‚Äúchief crypto advocate‚Äù and his sons as Web3 ambassadors, acquired $112 million worth of tokens in a series of transactions.\n\nThe purchases appeared to be a nod to Trump‚Äôs position as the 47th U.S. president. Key acquisitions included $47 million each in Ether (ETH) and wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), along with $4.7 million allocated to smaller tokens like Tron (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), Ethena (ENA), and Aave (AAVE), according to data from Arkham Intelligence.\n\nThe buying spree elevated World Liberty Financial‚Äôs total crypto holdings to over $343 million, sparking significant interest in the platform‚Äôs activities.\n\nPhoto by Art Rachen on Unsplash\nCoinbase Struggles With Solana Transaction Delays Amid Record Usage\n\nCoinbase users faced significant delays processing Solana transactions this week, as a surge in network activity pushed the exchange‚Äôs infrastructure to its limits. The disruption coincided with Solana reaching an all-time high of $294 on January 19, driven by a trading frenzy following the launch of both Trump and his wife Melania‚Äôs memecoins.\n\nAcknowledging user frustrations, Coinbase protocol specialist Andrew Allen wrote on X, ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs on us to improve. Not Solana‚Äôs fault. Solana usage has pushed our infra[structure] past its limits, and the team is well aware and actively working on it.‚Äù Some users reported delays of over 15 hours for transactions to complete.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also addressed the issue, stating that while the situation had been ‚Äútriaged,‚Äù the company plans to scale its infrastructure and improve support for Solana-related use cases such as decentralized exchange and memecoin trading.\n\nPhoto by PiggyBank on Unsplash\nFun Bits: The U.S. Government Is Officially DOGE-ing Around\n\nWe talked about DOGE potentially getting an ETF‚Ä¶ but other things happened around the dog memecoin.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, affectionately abbreviated as ‚ÄúDOGE,‚Äù has unveiled its official website, featuring a giant Dogecoin logo and‚Ä¶ well, nothing else. Yes, that‚Äôs right ‚Äî just a big, shiny homage to the world‚Äôs most famous memecoin. Somewhere, a Shiba Inu is smiling.\n\nPresident Trump announced the department‚Äôs creation during his inauguration, declaring its mission to ‚Äúrestore competence and effectiveness‚Äù to the federal government.\n\nHowever, after its website proudly displayed the logo, bringing joy and confusion to the crypto world, the logo has mysteriously vanished. The site now greets visitors with the same message ‚ÄúThe people voted for major reform,‚Äù but with no DOGE logo.\n\nGone are the memecoin vibes, replaced by the solemn tones of bureaucracy. But for a brief moment, the DOGE had its day.\n\nWatch the Recap!\n\nTo stay updated with everything that‚Äôs going on in crypto, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nSubscribe\n4 Likes\n4\nShare",

Young and Tikta\nTrump Declares Crypto a National Priority\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared crypto a national priority in an executive order signed on Thursday and set an intention to evaluate a strategic bitcoin reserve. In recent days, many social media users have speculated that he might establish one.\n\nThe order aims to deliver on multiple promises made to the crypto community, starting with some core and strongly held beliefs about coding, self-custody, and fair access to the banking system.\n\nIt also establishes an organization named the President‚Äôs Working Group on Digital Asset Markets to steward policies that will implement the intentions set forth in the order.\n\nJupiter‚Äôs Airdrop Propels Market Cap 87% Higher\n\nJupiter, a major decentralized exchange on Solana that has become one of the most closely watched projects in the blockchain‚Äôs fast-growing ecosystem, appears to have successfully managed its latest airdrop, increasing its market capitalization by 87% to nearly $3.5 billion.\n\nThe airdrop, one of the crypto industry‚Äôs biggest this year, started early on Wednesday with an allocation of 700 million JUP tokens to users.\n\nOn the first day, traders representing a half-million wallet addresses claimed 251 million JUP worth about $200 million, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Flipside Crypto.\n\nClaims for the highly-anticipated airdrop will remain open until April 30.\n\n‚ÄòBye, Bye SAB 121‚Äô: SEC Revokes Controversial Crypto Rules\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has canceled Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, an agency rule introduced under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler that the crypto industry had been fighting to overturn.\n\nThe core issue with SAB 121 was that it required digital assets under custody to be disclosed as both assets and liabilities on balance sheets, making crypto custody prohibitively expensive for banks.\n\n‚ÄúBye, bye SAB 121! It‚Äôs not been fun,‚Äù SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce wrote on X, referring to newly issued SAB 122, which rescinds the interpretive guidance related to crypto custody.\n\nActing SEC Chair Mark Uyeda had previously said that SAB 121 should be withdrawn, expressing concern over the fact that it was issued without a commission vote.\n\nPhoto by Arisa Chattasa on Unsplash\nSen. Cynthia Lummis to Chair Digital Assets Panel\n\nWyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis has been appointed as the first-ever chair of the new Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets ‚Äî a move that has convinced many industry watchers that a bitcoin strategic reserve is almost a certainty.\n\nThe subcommittee will focus on oversight of federal financial regulators to make sure so-called ‚ÄúOperation Chokepoint 2.0‚Äù ‚Äî which the crypto community has long suspected was a Biden administration policy to discourage banks from servicing individuals and banks affiliated with crypto ‚Äî is never repeated.\n\nLummis has emphasized the need for urgent bipartisan legislation to establish a comprehensive legal framework for digital assets and strengthen the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe subcommittee's formation aligns with President Donald Trump's recent executive order establishing a presidential working group on digital asset markets.\n\nPhoto by Joshua Sortino on Unsplash\n$30M Drained From Phemex Hot Wallets\n\nSingapore-based crypto exchange Phemex appears to be the first exchange to fall victim to a major hack this year.\n\nBlockchain security firm PeckShield flagged a suspicious outflow of funds from the exchange‚Äôs hot wallets on Thursday.\n\nWeb3 security auditor Hacken estimated that $30 million worth of USDC, CRV, USDT, AAVE, LINK, PEPE and FET was drained from the exchange.\n\nPhemex suspended withdrawals on Thursday to conduct an emergency inspection.\n\n‚ÄúWe are working on a compensation plan, which will be announced soon,‚Äù the team said on X. ‚ÄúOur ongoing business operations are fine. Trading services continue as usual.‚Äù\n\nPhoto by Nahel Abdul Hadi on Unsplash\nBinance Labs Rebrands to YZi Labz, CZ Takes ‚ÄòActive Role‚Äô\n\nBinance Labs has rebranded to call itself YZi Labs, with an expanded vision to focus on investments outside crypto and blockchain.\n\nBinance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, perhaps better known as ‚ÄúCZ, ‚Äùwill play ‚Äúan active role‚Äù in investing activities and the renamed business will be led by Ella Zhang, who co-founded Binance Labs in 2018.\n\nThe rebranding aligns with YZi Labs' transition into a family office structure. It also plans to refine its incubation program, including the reintroduction of a 12-week in-person residency initiative for project founders.\n\nZhao was charged last year with violating U.S. securities laws by failing to prevent illegal activity on Binance.\n\nHe paid a $50 million fine, served a four-month prison sentence, and agreed to a lifetime ban on working at Binance.\n\nBuild real-time, reactive, fully on-chain applications with Somnia: 400,000 TPS, sub-second finality, and sub-cent fees.

Crypto Is a National Priority üá∫üá∏\nTrump signs Executive Order that lays out steps to delivering on promises he made the crypto community.\nVERONICA IRWIN AND LAURA SHIN\nJAN 24, 2025\n5\n1\nShare\n\nYou are reading Unchained‚Äôs regulatory newsletter Unregulated, your go-to source for the latest insights, breaking scoops, and in-depth analysis on all things crypto regulation‚Äîone of the most critical topics in the industry today.\n\nNote: If you prefer to keep receiving only our daily newsletter and to opt out of the regulatory updates, simply head to your Substack settings and uncheck the regulatory newsletter box.\n\nHey all! Laura here. Veronica is not feeling well, so I‚Äôm sending the newsletter out for her.\n\nHaving covered crypto for 10 years, I feel like I witnessed a historic milestone today. Crypto is now a national priority of the United States. President Trump signed into law an executive order that broadly seems like a wish list from the crypto community (though I‚Äôm sure individuals may have some quibbles here or there).\n\nHowever, unlike last weekend‚Äôs $TRUMP and $MELANIA memecoin drops, the EO was practical, deliberate, and intended to build a foundation for all manner of crypto policy in the U.S. going forward.\n\nPresident Trump Declares Crypto a National Priority in Executive Order\n\nSigned on Thursday, the Executive Order establishes a working group on digital asset markets tasked with evaluating the potential creation of a national digital asset stockpile, among other things.\n\n(Shutterstock)\n\nPresident Trump declared crypto a national priority in an executive order signed Thursday, and set an intention to evaluate a strategic bitcoin reserve, while in recent days, many on social media had speculated he might establish one.\n\nThe order aims to deliver on multiple promises made to the crypto community, starting with some core and strongly held beliefs about coding, self-custody, and fair access to the banking system.\n\nIt also establishes an organization, the President‚Äôs Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, to steward the policies that will implement the intentions set forth in the order.\n\n‚ÄúThe digital asset industry plays a crucial role in innovation and economic development in the United States, as well as our Nation‚Äôs international leadership,‚Äù the executive order reads. ‚ÄúIt is therefore the policy of my Administration to support the responsible growth and use of digital assets, blockchain technology, and related technologies across all sectors of the economy.‚Äù\n\nA Sweeping Directive to Promote Crypto in the U.S.\n\nThe executive order, which had been the subject of much speculation in the crypto world, took a deliberate, foundational approach with its priorities.\n\nFirst, it states an intention to protect crypto developers contributing to public blockchains, miners, validators, and individuals who self-custody their assets.\n\nAdditionally, the order promises to protect ‚Äúfair and open banking services for all law-abiding citizens and private sector entities alike‚Äù‚Äîa reference to Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which the crypto community has long suspected was policy of the Biden Administration‚Äôs to discourage banks from servicing individuals and banks affiliated with crypto.\n\nRead More: Regulators Are Limiting Banks Serving Crypto Clients. Does That Violate the Law?\n\nThe executive order additionally prohibits federal agencies from creating Central Bank Digital Currencies and revokes the Biden administration‚Äôs Digital Assets executive order and former Treasury Department‚Äôs Framework for International Engagement on Digital Assets, which previously directed the Biden administration to promote the development of central bank digital currency technologies.\n\nA Crypto Working Group\n\nIn order to implement the goals of the order, it establishes a crypto working group which includes the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairs of the SEC and CFTC, and several other federal department heads.\n\nNotably, the executive order stops short of establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve, something the industry has been eagerly awaiting since his election, though it states an intention to engage with a first step: evaluate the possibility. Trump promised at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville that he would not sell bitcoin the federal government currently holds, a promise which he has the ability to ensure unilaterally via executive order.\n\nOn social media, the crypto community commented on the word choice of ‚Äúcrypto‚Äù stockpile, rather than one focused on Bitcoin, with Bitcoiners expressing disappointment and other crypto tribes seemingly hopeful. Some also noted the distinction between a ‚Äústockpile,‚Äù in which the government would retain crypto that comes into its possession, vs a ‚Äúreserve,‚Äù in which it would intentionally purchase digital assets.\n\nThe order states that within the first 180 days, the Working Group will submit a report to the president focused on a regulatory framework for market structure and stablecoins, both pieces of legislation that the crypto industry has requested for years.\n\nThe Working Group is to be chaired by the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, who, although unnamed in the order, Trump had previously nominated to be David Sacks, a longtime venture capitalist, currently of Craft Ventures.\n\nIt is notable that the Commerce Secretary is to be part of the Working Group. If he is confirmed, it would likely be Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald and current nominee who owns a minority stake in Tether.\n\nProhibiting Central Bank Digital Currencies\n\nTo support the growth of digital assets within the U.S., Trump ordered his administration to protect the sovereignty of USD by promoting the development of ‚Äúlegitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide.‚Äù\n\nIt also states that agencies are prohibited from working toward the establishment, issuance or promotion of a central bank digital currency in the U.S.\n\nRead More: House Resolution Could Overturn Rule That Declares DeFi Projects ‚ÄòBrokers‚Äô\n\nA New Era for Crypto\n\nThough the majority of the order formalizes promises previously made, Trump‚Äôs prioritization of crypto is an about-face from the Biden administration, which drew the industry‚Äôs ire for its antagonistic approach to cryptocurrencies. Regulators appointed by the administration, and in particular Gary Gensler, cast crypto companies as skirting the law, though many companies felt that existing regulations were unclear.\n\nFrequent enforcement actions from the SEC and also the CFTC and Treasury (albeit less often) led many crypto advocates to claim that the administration supported a policy of ‚Äúregulation by enforcement.‚Äù\n\nThe Biden administration‚Äôs stance also drove major crypto industry executives, like Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Kraken founder Jesse Powell, and Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stu Alderoty to donate generously to Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign. Several crypto firms also gave millions to Trump‚Äôs inaugural committee. Today‚Äôs executive order, in addition to the nomination and appointment of pro-crypto regulators at several federal agencies, is one way Trump is repaying the industry.\n\nThe news caused the Bitcoin price to jump from $104,000 to just under $106,000, before falling to $102,670 at press time, market data from CoinGecko shows.\n\nBitcoin enthusiasts at the Bitcoin Policy Institute and Satoshi Action Fund had also brainstormed potential ways Trump could also unilaterally pave the way for the federal government to acquire more bitcoin by using the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF), a Treasury-operated fund which currently includes U.S. dollars, foreign currencies, and an international reserve asset created by the International Monetary Fund. The fund exists to, as the name suggests, stabilize U.S. exchange rates, provide funds to foreign governments, and buy and sell foreign currencies, and using it to acquire cryptocurrency would have been unprecedented.\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nDonald Trump Frees Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht\n\nTrump Selects Caroline Pham as Acting CFTC Chair as Commission Votes Her In\n\nHouse Resolution Tuesday Could Overturn Rule That Declares DeFi Projects ‚ÄòBrokers‚Äô\n\n\nShare\n\nSubscribe\n\n5 Likes\n‚àô\n1 Restack\n5\n1\nShare",

At press time, the token was trading at around $15.70.\n\nDespite the ruling, Tornado Cash‚Äôs founders are still facing charges of conspiracy to carry out money laundering. Roman Storm, one of its founders, said on X: ‚ÄúThis prosecution represents a terrifying criminalization of privacy.‚Äù\n\nPhoto by Greg Johnson on Unsplash\nCME Nixes Erroneous Offer of XRP, SOL Futures\n\nThere were likely some red faces at CME Group on Wednesday after a page went live on Beta.cmegroup, a staging website of the derivatives marketplace‚Äôs main website, saying that XRP and SOL futures contracts would start trading next month.\n\nAccording to the page, which has since been taken down ‚Äî but not before being shared by at least one X user ‚Äî the contracts were to go live as soon as Feb. 10, pending regulatory approval.\n\nThe page said that all contracts would be settled in U.S. dollars and support multiple trading methods, including outright futures, basis trades at index close, and block trades.\n\n‚ÄúHonestly makes sense and largely to be expected if true IMO,‚Äù Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said of the CME beta webpage.\n\nA CME spokesperson reportedly later told Fox Business that the beta version had been made public in error, and that no official decisions had yet been made about launching futures contracts for either token.\n\nPhoto by Shubham Dhage on Unsplash\nLido Founder Says No ‚ÄòSecond Foundation‚Äô Exists Yet\n\nStaking protocol Lido‚Äôs co-founder, Konstantin Lomashuk, recently downplayed rumors about a \"second foundation\" for Ethereum, clarifying that no such entity has yet been established.\n\nThe rumors stemmed from his sharing of an X post by an entity calling itself Second Foundation, which led some users to assume that he was associated with the new organisation.\n\n‚ÄúThe tweet was just a tweet ‚Äî no actual second foundation has been created yet,‚Äù Lomashuk said. ‚ÄúEthereum is the ultimate world computer, and every Etherean can help it grow, evolve, and succeed.‚Äù\n\nThe idea of a second foundation has its roots in concerns about the Ethereum Foundation‚Äôs operations and decision-making processes.\n\nLomashuk had previously teased the idea of funding a second foundation, noting that creating competition between two groups would be an interesting idea to explore.\n\nBuild real-time, reactive, fully on-chain applications with Somnia: 400,000 TPS, sub-second finality, and sub-cent fees.

Young and Tikta\nDonald Trump Frees Silk Road Founder\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday evening that he had given Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht a full pardon.\n\nThe anonymous dark web marketplace, which became popular primarily for the trading of illicit goods, became one of the first use cases for Bitcoin.\n\n‚ÄúI just called the mother of Ross William Ulbright [sic] to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,‚Äù Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social. ‚ÄúThe scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of the government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!‚Äù\n\nUlbricht was convicted in 2015 and given a double-life sentence without the possibility of parole for drug trafficking crimes, conspiracy to commit computer hacking and money laundering in connection with the site, which was used by more than 100,000 people to buy and sell $214 million of illegal drugs and illicit services.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Ulbricht had solicited the murders of people he saw as threats to his business, although he was not charged over the alleged plots and no evidence was presented that anyone had been killed.\n\n(Associated Press)\nVitalik Buterin‚Äôs NFT Profile Change Spurs Talk of ‚ÄòWartime Mode‚Äô\n\nA simple change of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin‚Äôs social media profile picture has sparked optimism among members of the blockchain‚Äôs community that he might be stepping into a more active leadership role at the ostensibly decentralized network.\n\nButerin recently chose an NFT from the Ethereum-based Milady Maker collection as the avatar for his accounts on X and Farcaster. (Blockchain data suggest that a Buterin wallet address acquired the NFT as recently as last Saturday)\n\nX users have hailed the Miladys collection as representative of the ‚Äúcypherpunk ethos,‚Äù and interpreted the move by Buterin as a sign that he‚Äôs moving into ‚Äúwartime mode‚Äù as concerns mount that Ethereum might be lacking in direction or lagging in progress relative to competing networks such as Solana and Bitcoin.\n\nObol Collective, Focused on Decentralizing Ethereum Staking, Nears Token Airdrop Launch\n\nObol Collective, an infrastructure project known for distributed validator technology, is nearing the launch of its first airdrop, through which it will distribute 37.5 million tokens, or 7.5% of the total supply, to several parties in its ecosystem.\n\nOn Tuesday, the airdrop checker for people to see their allocation went live, with claims opening up on Friday, Obol Association CEO Thomas Heremans told Unchained.\n\nThe airdrop has three allocations: 40% is earmarked for contribution holders who have staked and provided capital to Obol, and 30% is dedicated to all the operators that are part of Obol‚Äôs decentralized operator ecosystem. The remaining portion is for solo stakers and Rocket Pool node operators.\n\nCoinbase to Delist USDT in the U.S. if New Laws Required\n\nCrypto exchange Coinbase will delist Tether-issued stablecoin USDT from its U.S. trading platform if it falls out of compliance with new legislation, CEO Brian Armstrong said in an interview at the World Economic Forum summit in Davos.\n\nCoinbase delisted USDT in Europe after new stablecoin rules under the Markets in Crypto-Asset Regulations (MiCA) came into effect last month.\n\nOffshore stablecoins such as USDT could be banned in the U.S. if proposed stablecoin regulations introduced in the Senate move forward. Although two bills have been introduced, neither has moved forward.\n\nCoinbase is a shareholder of Tether‚Äôs rival, Circle, which issues the USDC stablecoin. Both Coinbase and Circle continue to share revenue from USDC reserves interest, based on the amount of USDC held on their respective platforms.\n\nAI-generated image\nSEC Forms Crypto Task Force Led by Hester Peirce\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has formed a new crypto task force to develop a regulatory framework for the sector, which has long been asking for clearer rules.\n\nThe task force will be led by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, nicknamed ‚ÄúCrypto Mom\" on account of her pro-crypto stance.\n\nIt will focus on drawing clear regulatory lines, providing ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù paths to registration, and crafting ‚Äúsensible‚Äù disclosure frameworks.\n\nThe formation of the task force follows the appointment of Mark Uyeda as acting SEC chair after the departure of Gary Gensler, who took a notoriously tough approach to crypto regulation.\n\n‚ÄúClarity regarding who must register, and practical solutions for those seeking to register, have been elusive,‚Äù the regulator said. ‚ÄúThe result has been confusion about what is legal, which creates an environment hostile to innovation and conducive to fraud. The SEC can do better.‚Äù\n\nAI-generated image\nTrump ‚ÄòDidn‚Äôt Know Much‚Äô About TRUMP Memecoin\n\nPresident Donald Trump launched one of the most viral memecoins ever last week, but seemingly wasn‚Äôt aware of just how well it performed.\n\n‚ÄúI don't know much about it other than I launched it,‚Äù he said during a White House press conference on Tuesday. ‚ÄúI heard it was very successful. I haven‚Äôt checked it, where is it today?‚Äù\n\nWhen told that the memecoin had generated several billion dollars during the previous few days, Trump said that ‚Äúseveral billion‚Äù was ‚Äúpeanuts for these guys,‚Äù referring to billionaire Big Tech CEOs seated in front of his cabinet nominees.\n\nThe launch of the TRUMP coin sparked an angry reaction on Crypto Twitter, with users criticizing Trump for being involved with ‚Äúshitcoins‚Äù and slamming the whole exercise as unseemly as analysts raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest.\n\nThe price of TRUMP dropped 19% from an intraday high of $48.17 to a low of $38.85 following his comments. At press time, it was trading at around $41, still up more than 527% since its launch.\n\nAI-generated image\nCrypto.com Launches U.S. Institutional Crypto Platform\n\nSingapore-based Crypto.com has launched an institutional-grade cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S.\n\nThe Crypto.com Exchange, as it is known, will offer more than 300 crypto tokens and 480 trading pairs.\n\nGeared towards institutional and advanced traders, the new platform will feature deep global liquidity and ultra-low latency.\n\nCrypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek said that since the firm‚Äôs initial test of a U.S. version of its platform in 2022, it had invested significantly in technological capabilities and banking rails.\n\nThe launch came just one day after the inauguration of President Donald Trump and roughly a month after Marszalek reportedly met with him at his Mar-a-Lago golf resort in Florida.\n\nBuild real-time, reactive, fully on-chain applications with Somnia: 400,000 TPS, sub-second finality, and sub-cent fees.

I‚Äôm Veronica Irwin, Unchained‚Äôs regulatory reporter.\n\nPromise made, promise kept‚Ä¶kind of?¬†\n\nWhen Trump was elected president, crypto enthusiasts were excited about a lot of things - a bitcoin national reserve, a halt to crypto debanking, and the appointment of pro-crypto regulators, to name a few.¬†\n\nBut for many hardcore bitcoiners, their top concern was whether Trump would free the convicted Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, whose unregulated dark net marketplace became one of the first use cases of Bitcoin.¬†\n\nTrump had promised to commute Ulbricht‚Äôs sentence day one, which didn‚Äôt happen. Today, he did more than that, by granting him a full pardon.\n\nFor bitcoiners, a win is a win.\n\nDonald Trump Frees Silk Road Founder Ross Ulbricht\n\nThough Trump promised to free Ulbricht on Day 1, the Silk Road founder‚Äôs supporters consider it better late than never.\n\nAuthorities found Ulbricht with his laptop open (Associated Press)\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Trump announced he had fully pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the website Silk Road. The anonymous dark net marketplace, which became popular primarily for the trading of illicit goods, became one of the first use cases for Bitcoin.¬†\n\n‚ÄúI just called the mother of Ross William Ulbright [sic] to let her know that in honor of her and the Libertarian Movement, which supported me so strongly, it was my pleasure to have signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,‚Äù President Trump posted on Truth Social. ‚ÄúThe scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of the government against me. He was given two life sentences, plus 40 years. Ridiculous!‚Äù¬†¬†\n\nTrump had promised at the Libertarian National Convention in May ‚Äì and again at Bitcoin Nashville in July ‚Äì to commute the sentence of Ulbricht on ‚Äúday one.‚Äù¬† By pardoning Ulbricht, Trump effectively eliminates his conviction. Commuting Ulbricht‚Äôs sentence, as Trump had previously promised, would have lowered or eliminated Ulbricht‚Äôs punishment while keeping the conviction in place.\n\nThe Bitcoin Community Cheers\n\nThough Trump did not follow through on his initial promise by releasing Ulbricht from custody on January 20th, Ulbricht‚Äôs supporters on X seemed relieved by the news Tuesday.¬†\n\n‚ÄúWe Freed Ross. This counts as ‚ÄòDay 1‚Äô‚Äù Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey posted on X. ‚ÄúPromises Made, Promises Kept.‚Äù¬†\n\nLast May, though attendees of the Libertarian convention booed Trump multiple times during his speech, his pledge to free Ulbricht was met with cheers. Audience members held signs that said ‚ÄúFree Ross.‚Äù Many of them support Ross because of their disfavor of laws restricting drug sales in the U.S..¬†\n\nUlbricht had served nearly 10 years after being sentenced to life in prison on drug trafficking, computer hacking, and money laundering charges. He had been arrested two years earlier after being found by authorities with his laptop open.¬†\n\nIn the years since, Ulbricht had become a folk hero amongst bitcoiners for popularizing the cryptocurrency.¬†\n\nUlbricht‚Äôs defenders point out that he himself did not himself sell illicit goods on the platform, and that the Silk Road marketplace did not solely exist for the purpose of selling drugs but also to engage with others in an anonymous space.¬†\n\nSome also dispute that Ulbricht was the primary operator of Silk Road, an argument made by Ulbricht‚Äôs defense in court.¬†\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nHouse Resolution Today Could Overturn Rule That Declares DeFi Projects ‚ÄòBrokers‚Äô\n\nTrump Selects Caroline Pham as Acting CFTC Chair as Commission Votes Her In\n\nTrump Announces Team Working With AI & Crypto Czar: What We Know\n\n\nShare\n\nSubscribe\n\n7 Likes\n7\nShare",

Unchained has the text of the resolution.¬†\n\nHouse Resolution Today Could Overturn Rule That Declares DeFi Projects ‚ÄòBrokers‚Äô¬†\n\nDeFi advocates claimed reporting required by the IRS broker rule would have pushed DeFi development overseas.\n\nResolutions to overturn the IRS Broker Rule will be introduced in both chambers of Congress today. (Kolleen Post)\n\nOhio Republican House Representative Mike Carey will introduce a resolution to reverse a controversial IRS rule that the industry viewed as an attack on DeFi, at 3PM ET, Carey‚Äôs office told Unchained.¬†\n\nThe IRS broker rule, announced just before New Year‚Äôs, infuriated the crypto industry by expanding the definition of a ‚Äúbroker,‚Äù a label which requires extensive reporting to the IRS, to include DeFi developers.¬†\n\nHis resolution uses the Congressional Review Act, which gives Congress a mechanism to reverse federal agency rules, gives Congress until early March to reverse the broker rule. The text of the resolution is included below.¬†\n\nAcknowledging Blockchain Technology Is Different\n\nThe IRS broker rule ‚Äúfails to take into account the nature of blockchain itself and distributed systems more generally,‚Äù explained Ledger Vice President of Global Policy Seth Hertlein. ‚ÄúIt forces centralization where it doesn‚Äôt exist and doesn‚Äôt need to be in such a way that it sort of defeats the purpose of decentralized networks to begin with.‚Äù\n\nTexas Republican Senator Ted Cruz is also expected to announce three resolutions later today, as first reported by Axios last week, targeting the IRS broker rule as well as rules on energy and internet access enacted in the final days of Biden‚Äôs presidency. Carey‚Äôs resolution, however, will just target the IRS broker rule.¬†\n\nA Debate Over How to Tax DeFi\n\nThe Department of the Treasury framed the broker rule as a way to ensure tax revenue owed to the government is collected from both DeFi projects and centralized companies. The rule was first proposed in August 2023. Carey wrote a letter to the Treasury critiquing the rule on December 6.¬†\n\nBut DeFi advocates argued, months before the rule was formally introduced, that compliance would be so arduous that it would push DeFi development offshore.¬†\n\nThree industry groups (Blockchain Association, DeFi Education Fund, and the Texas Blockchain Council) sued the IRS after the bill was formally introduced on December 27.¬†\n\nA resolution must pass through both houses of Congress by majority vote. By having resolutions introduced in both the House and Senate, it is much more likely that the CRA will work to repeal the broker rule by deadline.¬†\n\nResolution Text:\n\nCarey 002 Xml[50]\n39.9KB ‚àô PDF file\nDownload\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nTrump Selects Caroline Pham as Acting CFTC Chair as Commission Votes Her In\n\nTrump Announces Team Working With AI & Crypto Czar: What We Know\n\nCrypto-Savvy Rep.

The funds could take several days to reach the wallet, she said.\n\nWang also said the foundation intends to use the new wallet to participate in the DeFi ecosystem, and that it had already sent out a test transaction on decentralized lending platform Aave.\n\nThe wallet was set up via smart-contract wallet provider Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) and will need three of five signatures to authorize a transaction.\n\nThe move comes after the foundation faced a backlash for selling crypto.\n\nIt has sold around $13.3 million worth of ETH since Jan 2, according to data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham.\n\nCritics have also taken aim at the foundation for its apparent lack of support for DeFi applications.\n\nPhoto by Tokenstreet on Unsplash\nTrump Picks Pham as Acting CFTC Chair\n\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission member Caroline Pham has become the regulator‚Äôs acting chair.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has not announced his choice for a permanent commission chair.\n\nSources close to the Trump transition team had previously told Unchained that CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger and A16z crypto Head of Policy Brian Quintenz were the two top contenders for the position. However, sentiment seemed to change over the weekend, when word spread that Pham might be chosen for the role.\n\nA representative of Pham confirmed that she had been selected by Trump for the position before being elected by her colleagues.\n\nTrump has 210 days to choose a permanent chair and have them confirmed by the Senate, according to the Federal Vacancies Act.\n\nRead More\n\nTrump-Backed World Liberty Financial Goes on Token Buying Spree\n\nDeFi platform World Liberty Financial, which lists President Donald Trump as its ‚Äúchief crypto advocate,\" and his sons as Web3 ambassadors, has been busy onchain.\n\nThe platform acquired $112 million of tokens on Monday, taking its total holdings to more than $343 million.\n\nMost of the purchases were made in installments of either 4.7 million USDT or 470,000 USDC ‚Äî seemingly a nod to Trump‚Äôs inauguration as 47th president of the U.S.\n\nWorld Liberty Financial spent $47 million to acquire WBTC, $47 million on buying ETH and $4.7 million each on TRX, ENA, LINK, and AAVE.\n\nTrump Appoints Crypto-Friendly Mark Uyeda as Acting SEC Chair\n\nNewly sworn-in President Donald Trump has appointed Mark Uyeda as the acting chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAs acting chairman, Uyeda is expected to lead the SEC until Trump's nominee for its permanent chair, former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, is confirmed by the Senate.\n\nUyeda is widely regarded as being more crypto-friendly than his predecessor, Gary Gensler, who stepped down on Monday.\n\nIn October, Uyeda described the SEC‚Äôs approach to crypto as a ‚Äúdisaster,‚Äù pointing to the regulator‚Äôs lack of guidance on rules for crypto firms.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve implemented ‚Äòpolicy through enforcement‚Äô without offering guidance,‚Äù he told Fox Business. ‚ÄúAs a result, courts have had to intervene, leading to inconsistent rulings.‚Äù\n\nSolana Usage Pushed Our Infra Past Limits, Says Coinbase Exec\n\nCoinbase users reported significant delays to Solana transactions on Jan. 20, but according to Coinbase Protocol Specialist Andrew Allen, the network isn‚Äôt to blame.\n\n‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs on us to improve. Not Solana‚Äôs fault,‚Äù Allen said on X. ‚ÄúSolana usage has pushed our infra[structure] past its limits, and the team is well aware and actively working on it.‚Äù\n\nOne user reported that a Solana transaction was stuck in limbo for more than 15 hours.\n\nAt the time of writing Coinbase‚Äôs status page showed that the team was still investigating delayed sends and receives on Solana.\n\nThe increased network activity on Solana over the last three days was driven largely by billions of dollars of Trump-related memecoin trading.\n\nBuild real-time, reactive, fully on-chain applications with Somnia: 400,000 TPS, sub-second finality, and sub-cent fees.

YOUNG\nJAN 21, 2025\n1\nShare\n\nYou are reading Unchained‚Äôs regulatory newsletter Unregulated, your go-to source for the latest insights, breaking scoops, and in-depth analysis on all things crypto regulation‚Äîone of the most critical topics in the industry today.\n\nNote: If you prefer to keep receiving only our daily newsletter and to opt out of the regulatory updates, simply head to your Substack settings and uncheck the regulatory newsletter box.\n\nHey! I‚Äôm Veronica Irwin, Unchained‚Äôs regulatory reporter.\n\nNewly inaugurated President Trump is a busy man.¬†\n\nBut somehow, amidst issuing a memecoin, drafting executive orders, and being inaugurated as America‚Äôs 47th president, he‚Äôs picked out an acting chair of the CFTC.¬†\n\nNotably, his choice, Caroline Pham, only leads the commission temporarily. She can serve in the role without being officially nominated and confirmed to lead the CFTC for up to 210 days. But while Trump‚Äôs team continues to vet official choices, crypto has one of its strongest advocates leading an agency that could soon become the industry‚Äôs primary regulator.\n\nTrump Selects Caroline Pham as Acting CFTC Chair as Commission Votes Her In\n\nPresident Trump has 210 days to pick a permanent chair and have them confirmed by the Senate.\n\nCaroline Pham frequently dissented from the Democratic-led commission over the past three years on crypto enforcement actions. (CFTC)\n\nCaroline Pham has become acting chair of the CFTC Commission, according to a Bloomberg report. The news has since been confirmed by Unchained. Trump has not announced his choice for a permanent chair of the commission.¬†\n\nPreviously, sources close to the Trump transition team had told Unchained that CFTC commissioner Summer Mersinger and a16z crypto Head of Policy Brian Quintenz were the two top contenders for the position. However, sentiments seemed to change over the weekend, when word spread that Pham may be chosen for the role.¬†\n\nA representative for Pham confirmed that she was selected by Trump for the position before being elected by her colleagues. Trump has 210 days to choose a permanent chair and have them confirmed by the Senate, according to the Federal Vacancies Act.¬†\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm humbled to lead the CFTC as Acting Chairman. It is an honor to be entrusted to serve the American people during this pivotal time,‚Äù Acting Chairman Caroline Pham said in an emailed statement. ‚ÄúI want to thank President Trump for his confidence in me, and I‚Äôm grateful to my colleagues and the CFTC staff for their support. I‚Äôm looking forward to engaging with all stakeholders in this new capacity as we focus on the CFTC‚Äôs mission to promote well-functioning markets that support economic growth and the competitiveness of the United States.‚Äù¬†\n\n‚ÄòFocused on Bringing Innovation Back‚Äô\n\nPham, who was appointed to the commission by President Biden on April 14, 2022, has a strong conservative track record and strong experience both in the private and public sector, her advocates explained. She has also been an ardent supporter of the crypto industry on the commission, often dissenting from enforcement actions against firms she saw as being unjustly targeted.¬†\n\nWhen Uniswap settled charges for offering leveraged commodity transactions with the CFTC, for example, Pham said that she was ‚Äúskeptical that the CFTC would try to enforce these statutory provisions outside of DeFi.‚Äù¬†\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve known acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham for over 15 years. The daughter of immigrants who fled the Vietnam war, her powerful personal story is uniquely American,‚Äù said Chris Perkins, President of CoinFund and Member of the CFTC Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee. ‚ÄúCaroline is a champion of markets and a supporter of the crypto industry. She will be focused on bringing innovation back onshore by introducing sandboxes, delivering regulatory clarity and refocusing on a principles-based approach.‚Äù¬†\n\nRepresentatives for President Trump and Mersinger did not respond to requests for comment by the time of publication. Brian Quintenz also did not respond to requests for comment.¬†\n\nCrypto‚Äôs More Important Regulatory Agency?\n\nThe agency which she currently works for, and now is set to lead, could become a key player in crypto regulation.¬†\n\nIf the recently sworn in pro-crypto Congress passes market structure legislation that gives oversight authority to the CFTC before a permanent chair is chosen, it will be up to Pham to spearhead the creation of interpretive rules outlining how the agency will execute on such laws.¬†\n\nRead More: Crypto Might Get Reality Check From Friendly U.S. Congress\n\nTrump reportedly intends (through a potential crypto market structure bill passed by Congress) to encourage the expansion of the CFTC‚Äôs oversight authority to crypto and roll back the power of the SEC, which was hostile to the industry starting in Trump‚Äôs first term in office and even more so during the Biden Administration under the leadership of Chair Gary Gensler.¬†\n\nThe crypto industry, which mostly backed president-elect Trump, has pushed for CFTC oversight authority of crypto over the course of several years, in addition to requesting clearer regulatory guardrails in the U.S. more broadly.¬†\n\nCrypto Legislation Incoming\n\nThe leader of the House Financial Services Committee, Arkansas Republican French Hill, said in July on the Unchained podcast that market structure legislation would be one of the first two bills he would try to pass through the committee.¬†\n\nThe Committee, alongside that on Agriculture, would likely draft the language for crypto market structure legislation. They also spearheaded the creation of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), a market structure bill which has not yet been passed by both chambers of Congress.¬†\n\nRead More: Rep. French Hill Says He‚Äôd Investigate Operation Choke Point 2.0 as Financial Services Chair\n\nMeanwhile, South Dakota Republican Dusty Johnson, who alongside Hill was one of the architects of FIT21, is expected to lead the Digital Assets Subcommittee of the House Agriculture Committee. With key advocates in place, it seems likely such legislation will be brought to a floor vote before the midterms.¬†\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nTrump Announces Team Working With AI & Crypto Czar: What We Know\n\nOhio Republican Senator Bernie Moreno to Serve on Influential Senate Banking Committee\n\nCrypto-Savvy Rep.

MELANIA was still up more than 40% from its debut price of $7.43, but had softened 20% from its high of around $13 to change hands for $10.44.\n\nCoinbase executive Conor Grogan said on X that Trump‚Äôs wife‚Äôs memecoin was structured differently from her husband‚Äôs, and appeared to have been funded by a wallet that traded on Pump.fun.\n\nIn another post, Grogan observed that Trump had sold $500 million worth of his tokens, and that the team still controls 85% of supply.\n\n‚ÄúOnce [the launch of TRUMP] was confirmed, we saw one of those rare moments in crypto where a single asset becomes a liquidity black hole,‚Äù Mena Theodorou, co-founder of crypto exchange Coinstash, told Unchained in an email.\n\n\"It‚Äôs a pattern we‚Äôve seen before, a lot like the Dogecoin run-up in early 2021,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe market was served with a curve ball, however, with the launch of MELANIA soon after disrupting this momentum. The new coin split the attention and money, leading to a big sell-off in Trump‚Äôs coin. This shows how fragile these hype-driven coins can be.\"\n\nPhoto by Library of Congress on Unsplash\nDaily Crypto Liquidations Top $1B Amid Market Volatility\n\nVolatility related to the TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins led to cascading liquidations across crypto markets on Sunday, with total liquidations topping $1.17 billion during the 24 hours to around 11 p.m. ET on Sunday, according to data from CoinGlass.\n\nOver the 12-hour period to the same time, bitcoin saw $161 million of liquidations, while ether saw $118 million.\n\nBinance received the biggest single liquidation order, which nixes a BTC/USDT trading pair valued at $15.24 million.\n\nUnsurprisingly, given the volatility of the TRUMP token, it was the most heavily liquidated position over a shorter timeframe of one hour to 11 p.m., with more than $1.38 million of liquidations.\n\nPhoto by Adam ≈ömigielski on Unsplash\nSolana‚Äôs Daily Trading Volume Hits $39B\n\nThe Solana blockchain had a historic day for trading volume on Sunday, and the network was even briefly disrupted after a surge in activity caused by frenzied trading of TRUMP and MELANIA memecoins.\n\nSolana processed $39 billion, with decentralized exchanges such as Raydium accounting for nearly $15 billion of volume, according to data from crypto research platform Blockworks.\n\nThe network also set a record for daily real economic value, a measurement of value accrual based on in-protocol transaction fees and out-of-protocol tips that surged to $56.9 million on Sunday.\n\nPhoto by GuerrillaBuzz on Unsplash\nHere‚Äôs How to Protect Your Crypto and Seed Phrases From Natural Disasters\n\nLaura Shin sits down with Ari Gore, head of communications at ZenGo Wallet, to discuss how the crypto community can keep crypto assets secure.\n\nAri shares how the crypto industry can better help users protect their assets from natural disasters, emphasizing the need for more secure and user-friendly custody solutions.\n\nBuild real-time, reactive, fully on-chain applications with Somnia: 400,000 TPS, sub-second finality, and sub-cent fees.

Director Sota Watanabe explains.\n\nThis week, Sony launched the mainnet for Soneium, its Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain built on the OP Stack from Optimism. Soneium is designed to support creators, developers, and fans through tools like Sony‚Äôs NFT-based Fan Marketing Platform and Soneium Spark.\n\nHowever, Soneium‚Äôs launch has sparked controversy. Its decision to blacklist some memecoins‚Äîover intellectual property concerns‚Äîhas raised questions about the balance between decentralization and protecting creators‚Äô rights. Even Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin weighed in, highlighting the tradeoffs businesses face in Web3.\n\nIn this episode, Sota Watanabe, director of Soneium, delves into the memecoin controversy, and explains the vision for the platform, their commitment to IP protection, and what‚Äôs next for Soneium in entertainment and finance.\n\nPlus, at the end of the episode, Laura speaks to Ari Gore, head of communications at Zengo Wallet, about protecting your private keys and your cryptocurrencies from natural disasters.\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nWeekly News Recap\nU.S. Approves $9 Billion Bitcoin Restitution to Bitfinex After 2016 Hack\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has announced plans to return over 90,000 bitcoin, valued at over $9 billion, to crypto exchange Bitfinex. These funds are part of the nearly 120,000 BTC stolen in a 2016 hack that was one of the largest in crypto history.\n\nIn a court filing submitted on Tuesday, prosecutors identified Bitfinex as the rightful owner of the recovered bitcoin, which represents the coins left in the hackers‚Äô wallets. The remainder, approximately 25,000 BTC, was laundered through complex methods and will require additional legal proceedings for recovery.\n\nThe recovered funds were seized from Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, who were convicted in 2023 of conspiracy to launder the stolen assets. Lichtenstein received a five-year sentence, while Morgan was sentenced to 18 months.\n\nBitfinex has stated that 80% of the recovered funds will be used to repurchase and burn its LEO tokens, a debt token created to offset customer losses after the hack.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\nXRP Surges Amid Reports of U.S. Crypto Reserve Proposal\n\nA report by the New York Post, citing anonymous sources, has ignited a wave of speculation about the possibility of an America-first crypto reserve under the Trump administration. According to the report, Trump is ‚Äúreceptive‚Äù to the proposed reserve, which was reportedly discussed in recent meetings between Trump and U.S. crypto founders, and could see U.S.-founded digital assets prioritized, including XRP, Solana, and USDC. This potential policy shift has sparked significant excitement, and some criticism, within the cryptocurrency community.\n\nCo-founder of crypto research firm Reflexivity Research Will Clemente, commented: ‚ÄúSorry, but in my opinion the reserve should be Bitcoin only and maybe to a lesser extent stablecoins (backed by treasuries), for the sake of the United States‚Äô future. Seems like this was brought into Trump‚Äôs mind by some of the people that have been in his ear.‚Äù\n\nFollowing the report, XRP‚Äôs price surged by 13.4%, hitting a seven-year high of $3.40. Trading volumes spiked across major exchanges, with Coinbase reporting $1.9 billion in XRP activity, accounting for 28.7% of its total volume, and Binance seeing $3.7 billion in trades.\n\nHowever, Unchained discovered that the market-driving speculation might be unfounded. Sources suggested that Ripple Labs, the primary contributor to XRP‚Äôs blockchain, could have fueled the rumors to align with ongoing regulatory shifts. Ripple representatives had reportedly met with Trump recently, despite his past criticism of the company, according to two sources with knowledge of the meeting.\n\nAdding to the intrigue, Ripple‚Äôs co-founder Chris Larsen‚Äôs political donations to PACs supporting Kamala Harris surfaced, with Axios quoting Trump allegedly saying, ‚Äúyou weren‚Äôt with me, and maybe you were with Kamala Harris,‚Äù during a meeting with the company.\n\nTrump Administration Poised to Overhaul Crypto Policies With New SEC Leadership\n\nRegardless of whether an altcoin reserve is in the works or not, crypto is clearly top of mind for Trump. According to a report by the Washington Post, Trump plans to issue executive orders addressing crypto industry concerns in his first week, including reversing controversial measures that restricted banking access for crypto firms. These actions were dubbed ‚ÄúOperation Chokepoint 2.0‚Äù by critics during the Biden administration.\n\nThe Trump administration is also expected to tackle the accounting policy requiring banks to classify digital assets as liabilities, which many believe stifled institutional crypto adoption.\n\nAt the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Republican commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda will assume majority control and are reportedly planning to begin rule-making processes to clarify when cryptocurrencies qualify as securities. They are also expected to review pending enforcement actions and may freeze non-fraud-related cases.\n\nPhoto by History in HD on Unsplash\nTether Finalizes Move to El Salvador, Citing Favorable Crypto Environment\n\nTether, the company behind the world‚Äôs largest stablecoin USDT, is completing its relocation to El Salvador after receiving approval as a licensed digital asset service provider and stablecoin issuer. This marks the first time Tether will establish a physical headquarters, with Reuters reporting that the firm plans to hire 100 Salvadorans over the next few years.\n\nCEO Paolo Ardoino and Tether‚Äôs leadership team are also moving their residences to the Bitcoin-friendly nation, according to the report. Ardoino highlighted El Salvador‚Äôs supportive policies and a growing crypto-savvy community as key reasons for the move.\n\nOn the Bits + Bips podcast, Ram Ahluwalia called the relocation a ‚Äúmassive failure‚Äù of U.S. stablecoin policy, noting, ‚ÄúThese are profits that could have been earned by American businesses, but regulatory decisions pushed them offshore.‚Äù\n\nSEC Appeals XRP Ruling, Challenges Retail Sales Exemption\n\nThe SEC has filed an appeal with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, seeking to overturn a 2023 district court ruling that Ripple‚Äôs XRP token was not a security when sold to retail investors. The SEC claims the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York misapplied securities law and Supreme Court precedents, including the Howey Test.\n\nThe SEC‚Äôs argument centers on the district court‚Äôs distinction between XRP sales to institutional investors, which were deemed securities, and sales to retail investors, which the court ruled did not meet the same criteria. The agency asserts retail investors also expected profits based on Ripple‚Äôs public efforts to increase demand for XRP.\n\nRipple‚Äôs chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, dismissed the SEC‚Äôs appeal as a ‚Äúrehash of failed arguments.‚Äù The case, stemming from the SEC‚Äôs 2020 allegations that Ripple raised $1.3 billion through unregistered securities sales, remains pivotal for the regulatory future of digital assets.\n\nPhoto by Jametlene Reskp on Unsplash\nCoinbase Scores Another Legal Victory as Court Demands SEC Clarify Crypto Rules\n\nFollowing its appeal in the XRP ruling, the SEC faces further scrutiny after a federal appellate court ordered the agency to provide a clearer explanation of its refusal to create specific cryptocurrency regulations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled in favor of Coinbase on Monday, stating the SEC‚Äôs handling of the petition was ‚Äúarbitrary and capricious.‚Äù\n\nCoinbase had filed the petition in 2022, seeking guidance on how securities laws apply to digital assets. While the court stopped short of mandating new crypto-specific rules, it directed the SEC to justify its position on crypto assets more thoroughly. Judge Stephanos Bibas emphasized the need for a well-reasoned explanation, cautioning the SEC against issuing another insufficient response.\n\nCoinbase‚Äôs chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, welcomed the decision, calling it a significant step toward regulatory clarity.\n\nPhoto by Tingey Injury Law Firm on Unsplash\nBitMEX Ordered to Pay Additional $100 Million Over AML Violations\n\nCrypto exchange BitMEX has been fined an additional $100 million by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for violating anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) rules under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The judgment follows earlier penalties, including a $110 million settlement reached last year after BitMEX admitted to the violations.\n\nThe court found that BitMEX had failed to establish effective AML and KYC systems from 2015 to 2020, allowing illicit activity and U.S. user access without appropriate regulatory compliance. Prosecutors argued the exchange generated $1.3 billion in global revenue while evading U.S. laws.\n\nBitMEX parent company HDR Global Trading Inc. now faces a two-year probationary period. The penalties come amid broader enforcement actions, including previous charges against BitMEX founders and executives for related violations by agencies such as the CFTC and FinCEN.\n\nPhoto by Alexander Grey on Unsplash\nChainlink Whale Exploits Staking Limits, Moves Millions in LINK to Binance\n\nA prominent trader, pseudonymously known as ‚ÄúOldwhite‚Äù on the OpenSea platform, has drawn attention for circumventing Chainlink‚Äôs staking restrictions and recently moving millions in LINK tokens to Binance. Chainlink, a blockchain oracle network, originally capped staking at 7,000 tokens per wallet to encourage broad participation when it launched its staking program in 2022.\n\nThe trader bypassed this limit by deploying over 100 wallet addresses, staking a total of more than 1 million LINK tokens ‚Äî worth over $20 million at current prices. This strategy, referred to as ‚ÄúSybil‚Äù manipulation, enabled the user to dominate the staking pool, which Chainlink had aimed to democratize.\n\nOnchain data examined by Unchained reveals that between November and January, ‚ÄúOldwhite‚Äù consolidated rewards from 113 wallets into a single address. As of Dec. 29, the address sent 280,164 LINK, valued at $6 million, to Binance, a move likely signaling intent to sell.\n\nPhoto by Todd Cravens on Unsplash\nJupiter Prepares $575 Million JUP Token Airdrop\n\nJupiter, a decentralized exchange aggregator on the Solana blockchain, has announced details of its highly anticipated ‚ÄúJupuary‚Äù airdrop. Set to take place next week, the event will distribute 700 million JUP tokens, valued at $575 million, to the community. This marks the protocol‚Äôs second annual airdrop, following last year‚Äôs event, which rewarded 955,000 wallets.\n\nThe allocation includes 440 million tokens for users, 60 million for stakers, and 200 million for growth initiatives aimed at expanding Jupiter‚Äôs ecosystem. According to Jupiter contributor Kash Dhanda, approximately two million wallets are eligible for this year‚Äôs rewards. ‚ÄúThe ~2 million wallets that do receive the airdrop will be more likely to be real cats‚Ä¶ and help us accelerate towards a decentralized future,‚Äù Dhanda explained in a research post.\n\nThe rewards are tier-based, favoring active participants. For instance, top-tier ‚Äúexpert traders‚Äù can receive up to 300,000 JUP, worth around $250,000, while lower-tier participants may get as few as 20 JUP. Jupiter also launched a rewards checker tool, allowing users to verify eligibility ahead of the drop.\n\nPhoto by Mona Magnussen on Unsplash\nEthereum Foundation Revamps Social Media Strategy Amid Criticism\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation (EF) has unveiled a revamped approach to its social media presence following community criticism over its lack of marketing. The foundation announced the introduction of a new account, @EthereumFndn, to share updates on grants, projects, and treasury movements, while the @Ethereum handle will now be used more actively for general updates.\n\nThis shift comes after years of sparse activity on the @Ethereum account, which posted just 14 original tweets since mid-2021. The announcement, shared on X (formerly Twitter), marks the EF‚Äôs effort to address concerns that its minimal social engagement hindered Ethereum‚Äôs growth and narrative.\n\n‚ÄúThis is the beginning of a new approach‚Ä¶ we plan to iterate and expand over time,‚Äù wrote the foundation.\n\nCommunity members, including Ethereum builder Joseph Schiarizzi, expressed optimism, saying the change could help highlight the ecosystem‚Äôs achievements. The foundation also extended its social strategy to platforms such as Bluesky and Lens.\n\nPhoto by Tokenstreet on Unsplash\nPump.fun Faces Legal Threat Over Alleged Investor Harm and Controversial Practices\n\nNew York-based Burwick Law has announced plans to pursue legal action against Solana-based meme coin platform Pump.fun, citing claims of investor harm and unethical activities promoted on the platform. The law firm is calling for affected users to step forward and support the case to seek restitution.\n\nPump.fun, responsible for creating over six million tokens since its January 2024 launch, has faced criticism for fostering speculative trading and risky behavior. The platform controversially suspended its livestreaming feature for allegedly encouraging acts such as staged suicides and animal abuse to promote tokens.\n\nDespite its dominance, accounting for 70% of recent transactions on the Solana network, data from Dune analyst Adam Tehc reveals only 0.4% of its users have profited over $10,000.\n\nPhoto by Joshua J. Cotten on Unsplash\nFun Bits: TikTok Ban Drama Turns Pink Dino Memecoin Into a Superstar\n\nAs the U.S. mulls kicking TikTok off the app store, crypto did what crypto does best: turn global drama into a memecoin frenzy. The unlikely star? A pink dinosaur named MOMO. Yes, really.\n\nMOMO, a Solana-based token, was chilling in obscurity until TikTok ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù flocked to China‚Äôs Instagram-like app, RedNote, where users embraced the dino as a kind of digital mascot. The default username on RedNote is ‚Äúmomo.‚Äù Fast forward a couple of days, and memecoin MOMO‚Äôs value shot up 160x because‚Ä¶ why not?\n\nWith a market cap under $5 million and trading volume barely $40 million, MOMO isn‚Äôt exactly taking on bitcoin. But hey, who needs fundamentals when you have a cute mascot and social media chaos? If TikTok gets banned, MOMO might just moon again ‚Äî because nothing screams freedom like onchain dino memes.\n\nPhoto by Alex Conradt on Unsplash\nWatch the Recap!\n\nTo stay updated with everything that‚Äôs going on in crypto, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nSubscribe\n2 Likes\n2\nShare",

Young, Tikta and Juan Aranovich\nLikely False Rumors of Altcoin Reserve Send XRP and SOL Prices Soaring\n\nThe XRP token was spiking in digital-asset markets after a New York Post report Thursday morning said that incoming president Donald Trump was ‚Äúreceptive‚Äù to including non-bitcoin, American cryptocurrencies in a national reserve.\n\nThe speculation made XRP one of the most traded tokens on popular crypto exchanges by volume, with the third-largest cryptocurrency jumping 10% in 24 hours on Thursday to a seven-year high of around $3.40 before retreating below $3.30 Friday morning.\n\nMeanwhile, Solana‚Äôs SOL token also saw its price leap more than 5% in the same period to $213. It was trading 7.5% higher Friday morning, changing hands for $216.\n\nThree sources told Unchained the market-driving rumor was likely untrue.\n\nSolana‚Äôs Inflation Rate Could Drop Under Multicoin Proposal\n\nCrypto investment firm Multicoin Capital published a Solana governance proposal on Thursday to change the network‚Äôs current emission model and reduce the inflation of the network‚Äôs native token, SOL.\n\nThe proposal, SIMD-0228, aims to make Solana‚Äôs emissions of SOL more market-oriented by making the emission rate dynamic and variable. Proof-of-stake blockchains such as Solana and Ethereum issue new tokens as a means to incentivize validators and stakers, contributing to network security.\n\nCoinbase Is Back in the U.S. Bitcoin Loan Business\n\nCoinbase is bringing back crypto-backed loans for U.S. customers outside the state of New York, the exchange said in a blog post on Thursday.\n\nEligible users can borrow up to $100,000 of USDC, depending on how much bitcoin they have available to pledge as collateral.\n\nOnce confirmed, their BTC will be converted to Coinbase‚Äôs version of wrapped bitcoin, cbBTC, and transferred onchain through Morpho Protocol‚Äôs smart contracts.\n\nCoinbase previously offered bitcoin-backed loans through its Borrow program, but the service was discontinued in May 2023 after the exchange received a Wells notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nPhoto by PiggyBank on Unsplash\nTether Deploys USDT0 Stablecoin on Kraken‚Äôs L2 Ink\n\nTether has launched a new cross-chain version of its USDT stablecoin on Kraken's layer 2 blockchain, Ink.\n\nThe new USDT0 coin is designed to enhance USDT's interoperability across multiple blockchain ecosystems and is built on LayerZero‚Äôs Omnichain Fungible Token standard.\n\nThe cross-chain stablecoin maintains a 1:1 backing with USDT on Ethereum and eliminates the need for liquidity pools or custom bridges.\n\n‚ÄúTether fully supports innovation, but as a note this is separate from Tether‚Äôs direct operations,‚Äù said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino on X, clarifying that the launch was an ‚Äúecosystem initiative‚Äù separate from Tether‚Äôs direct operations.\n\nPhoto by Mariia Shalabaieva on Unsplash\nUS Crypto Exchanges to Send Info Directly to IRS in 2025\n\nCrypto investors in the U.S. have been awaiting a new era of pro-crypto policy, but they may also need to brace for changes as far as crypto tax reporting goes.\n\nFor the first time, many crypto transactions will be subject to third-party reporting requirements, with information sent directly to the Internal Revenue Service, according to a CNN report.\n\nThe new reporting system applies to transactions conducted on centralized crypto trading platforms such as Coinbase and Gemini, which will be required to track and record users' buy and sell transactions throughout the year.\n\nThe information will be reported on a new form named 1099-DA that will be sent to both users and the IRS in early 2026.\n\nReporting for peer-to-peer transactions on decentralized platforms such as Uniswap and Sushiswap will be postponed until 2027.\n\nPhoto by Sean Lee on Unsplash\nTRON Sees Biggest Drop in Illicit Transfer Volume: TRM Labs\n\nBlockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs found that the Tron blockchain saw the largest decline in illicit activity during 2024, exceeding Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nTRM‚Äôs report says that TRON saw a 58% decline in illicit volume, which dropped by $6 billion.\n\nThat marked a significant shift from 2023, when TRM Labs found that TRON had been the blockchain with the highest volume of illicit cryptocurrency transactions in recent years.\n\nTRM attributed the decline in illicit activity in part to its own initiative with Tron and Tether, known as the T3 Financial Crime Unit, which aims to tackle illicit activity.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\nZKsync Becomes No. 2 Blockchain for Real-World Assets\n\nZKsync, an Ethereum layer 2, has emerged as the second-largest blockchain for real-world assets (RWA), with a 23% market share, following Tradable‚Äôs announcement of $1.7 billion in tokenized private credit assets.\n\nAccording to data from RWA.xyz, ZKsync now trails only Ethereum, which holds the top spot, with $4 billion in RWA and a 52% market share.\n\nTradable, a platform focused on tokenizing institutional-grade investments, achieved the milestone by tokenizing nearly 30 private credit positions.\n\nInstitutional collaborators, including Victory Park Capital, Janus Henderson, and ParaFi Capital, supported Tradable‚Äôs rollout, leveraging ZKsync‚Äôs infrastructure for cost-effective and secure on-chain operations.\n\n‚ÄúBy leveraging blockchain rails, we‚Äôre enabling the supply side to provide any arbitrary institutional grade asset, starting with best-in-class private credit opportunities, to any number of demand side investors, whether on-chain or not,‚Äù said Tradable‚Äôs CEO, Alex Cordover.\n\n‚ÄúThis is a huge win for Ethereum and a big one for ZKsync,‚Äù added Omar Azhar, head of business development at Matter Labs, the developer of the layer 2.\n\nBuild real-time, reactive, fully on-chain applications with Somnia: 400,000 TPS, sub-second finality, and sub-cent fees.

YOUNG\nJAN 17, 2025\n2\n1\nShare\n\nYou are reading Unchained‚Äôs regulatory newsletter Unregulated, your go-to source for the latest insights, breaking scoops, and in-depth analysis on all things crypto regulation‚Äîone of the most critical topics in the industry today.\n\nNote: If you prefer to keep receiving only our daily newsletter and to opt out of the regulatory updates, simply head to your Substack settings and uncheck the regulatory newsletter box.\n\nHey! I‚Äôm Sage Young, Unchained‚Äôs data and tokens reporter.\n\nMy colleague Veronica Irwin and I don‚Äôt often have a chance to work together, but a story came along that was the rare intersection between our two beats. I reported on the rally in altcoins like XRP, while she dug into the rumors that had sparked the surge.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs just say there‚Äôs a reason why we‚Äôre choosing the word ‚Äúrumor‚Äù here.\n\nLikely False Rumors of Altcoin Reserve Send XRP and SOL Prices Soaring\n\nIn light of the speculation, XRP is among the most traded tokens on Coinbase and Binance, climbing to a seven-year high of almost $3.40.\n\nXRP‚Äôs market capitalization of $194.6 billion is the third largest, trailing BTC and ETH. (Shutterstock)\n\nThe XRP token was spiking in digital-asset markets after a New York Post report Thursday morning said that Trump was ‚Äúreceptive‚Äù to including non-bitcoin, American cryptocurrencies in a national reserve.\n\nHowever, three sources told Unchained the market-driving rumor was likely untrue.\n\nThe speculation made XRP one of the most traded tokens on popular crypto exchanges by volume, with the third-largest cryptocurrency jumping 10% in the last 24 hours to a seven-year high around $3.40. Meanwhile, Solana‚Äôs SOL token also saw its price leap more than 5% in the same period to $213.\n\n‚ÄúXRP‚Äôs recent move can be attributed to strong associations between Ripple‚Äôs team and the potential alignment with policy shifts under the Trump administration leading up to the inauguration,‚Äù Jake Ostrovskis, an over-the-counter trader at crypto liquidity provider Wintermute, told Unchained over Telegram.\n\nIn the Works or a ‚ÄòSelf-Serving‚Äô Rumor?\n\nOn Thursday, the New York Post reported that Trump was receptive to the possibility of an America-first strategic reserve that would include cryptocurrencies founded in the U.S. such as XRP and SOL.\n\n‚ÄúAs of today, traders are betting the asset could be added to a strategic reserve, following news that dropped this morning,‚Äù according to the Wintermute trader.\n\nThe New York Times reported later Thursday that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse encouraged Trump to include other cryptocurrencies beyond BTC in the federal government‚Äôs potential crypto stockpile. The publication didn‚Äôt echo the New York Post‚Äôs reporting that the president-elect was ‚Äúreceptive‚Äù to the idea.\n\nRipple‚Äôs senior director of communications, Susan Hendrick, confirmed to Unchained that Garlinghouse had encouraged Trump to diversify the potential crypto reserve beyond BTC, but she didn‚Äôt provide commentary on whether Trump was receptive to the diversification.\n\nRead More: Crypto-Friendly Summer Mersinger Is Now the Top Contender for CFTC Chair\n\nSources speaking to Unchained speculated the New York Post report actually reflected a ‚Äúself-serving‚Äù rumor seeded by Ripple Labs representatives. Ripple is the primary contributor to the XRPL blockchain network, which uses XRP as its native token.\n\nHendrick, the Ripple Labs spokeswoman, didn‚Äôt address Unchained‚Äôs request for comment on whether the possibility of an altcoin reserve was a ‚Äúself-serving‚Äù rumor planted by company executives.\n\nA report in Axios on Wednesday quoted Trump telling representatives of an unidentified company, ‚ÄúYou guys made this amount of money last year and you‚Äôre gonna make so much more now because of me‚Ä¶But when I needed you, where the f**k were you? You weren‚Äôt with me and maybe you were with [Kamala Harris].‚Äù\n\nTwo sources told Unchained that that conversation was with representatives of Ripple. The Axios story did not name Ripple, or say when the conversation took place. (Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen donated millions to PACs supporting Kamala Harris.)\n\nThe Ripple Labs spokeswoman didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment on the sources‚Äô claim that the unnamed company in the Axios report was Ripple. The Trump-Vance transition team also didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.\n\nXRP‚Äôs price movement comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday filed an appeal against Ripple Labs and Garlinghouse, arguing that district court judge Analisa Torres‚Äô erred ‚Äúfactually and legally‚Äù in her 2023 ruling that sales of XRP on crypto trading platforms were not offers and sales of investment contracts.\n\nOn the dominant U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase, XRP‚Äôs 24-hour volume stands at $2 billion, making up nearly 30% of the swapping venue‚Äôs total trading activity. Users on the non-U.S.-based exchange Binance generated $3.8 billion, or about 12% of total volume, the second most behind bitcoin, according to CoinGecko.\n\nRead More: Jupiter Announces Details of Its Upcoming Airdrop of $575 Million Worth of JUP Tokens\n\nOnchain Activity Rising\n\nJulio Moreno, head of research at blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, told Unchained XRP is seeing increased onchain activity.\n\nNot only have daily active wallet addresses for XRP risen from a low of 10,000 in mid-2024 to a high of over 100,000 at the end of 2024, but liquidity on XRPL‚Äôs decentralized exchange (DEX) has quadrupled since early November to $20 billion this week, data from CryptoQuant shows.\n\nThe XRPL DEX also has a number of memecoins such as ARMY and PHNIX, which have had a 24-hour trading volume of $5.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively, according to trading platform DEX Screener.\n\nWintermute‚Äôs Ostrovskis argued that retail investors are playing a ‚Äúsignificant role‚Äù in XRP‚Äôs price action, and the token‚Äôs ‚Äúwidespread availability on retail platforms has further supported substantial trading activity and buying flow.‚Äù\n\nCryptoQuant‚Äôs Moreno said large holders dominate XRP on exchanges as shown by ‚Äúinflows of XRP into exchanges coming from transactions of 1 million or more XRP ($3M or more at current prices).‚Äù\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\n39 Ways You Could Lose Money in Crypto: How to Keep Your Money Safe\n\nCrypto-Friendly Summer Mersinger Is Now the Top Contender for CFTC Chair\n\nJupiter Announces Details of Its Upcoming Airdrop of $575 Million Worth of JUP Tokens\n\n\nShare\n\nSubscribe\n\n2\n1\nShare",

Young and Tikta\nChainlink Whale Starts Cashing Out to Binance\n\nIn 2022, blockchain project Chainlink rolled out new functionality allowing crypto investors to stake the project‚Äôs tokens ‚Äî letting users lock them up in exchange for rewards. In an effort to assure broad participation, Chainlink initially imposed a 7,000-token limit for each wallet.\n\nBut one clever trader managed to circumvent that limit by creating more than 100 wallet addresses to stake over 1 million LINK tokens, which are worth more than $20 million at their current price.\n\nNow, that trader, who has been identified as the pseudonymous user ‚ÄúOldwhite‚Äù on the OpenSea platform, appears to be moving to unwind some of their positions to Binance at a substantial profit, in some ways validating the hydra-headed wallet strategy and underscoring the difficulty projects sometimes face in trying to enforce such limits, however worthy their intentions.\n\nVirtuals Ecosystem Sees Boost on Buyback-and-Burn Program\n\nVirtuals Protocol, a tooling platform that enables people to create artificial intelligence agents, has seen a price jump in numerous cryptocurrencies native to its ecosystem following the unveiling of details of the protocol‚Äôs buyback-and-burn program.\n\nThe price of VIRTUAL had increased more than 27% in the 24 hours before press time to trade at $3.74, giving the cryptocurrency a market capitalization of more than $3.7 billion, data from CoinGecko show.\n\nMeanwhile, two of the top AI agent coins on Virtuals by market cap ‚Äî AIXBT and GAME ‚Äî had increased 40% and 39%, respectively, in the 24 hours to press time. LUNA was up 27%, while VADER had risen a more modest 4%.\n\nVirtuals‚Äô entire ecosystem, which is built on Coinbase-incubated layer 2 Base, has a market cap of roughly $6 billion.\n\nJupiter to Airdrop $575M of JUP\n\nCrypto users of Jupiter, a decentralized exchange aggregator on the Solana blockchain, are about to receive free money.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jupiter contributors announced that the protocol‚Äôs second airdrop is expected to occur next week before its Jan. 25-26 ‚ÄúCatstanbul‚Äù conference in Istanbul. @MessiasMorten, who is part of Jupiter DAO‚Äôs core working group, said on the protocol‚Äôs Discord that an exact claim date has yet to be announced.\n\nOut of 700 million JUP tokens worth about $575 million allocated for the airdrop, 440 million have been earmarked for users, 60 million are for stakers, and the remaining tokens will be used as ‚Äúcarrots‚Äù ‚Äî growth campaigns to bring more users to the onchain swapping venue.\n\nBitcoin Rallies Past $100,000 as U.S. Inflation Eases\n\nBitcoin rallied to an intraday high of $100,781 on Wednesday after markets reacted positively to a lower-than-expected consumer price index number.\n\nThe U.S. core CPI fell to 3.2%, below the expected 3.3%, slightly increasing bets on a March interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe data had a favorable effect on most risk assets, with the three main U.S. indices ending higher and the S&P 500 boasting 20 new 52-week highs.\n\nBitcoin‚Äôs positive price action had a negative impact on some crypto traders, with $210 million of short positions liquidated during the 24 hours up to the time of writing, according to data from CoinGlass.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\nU.S. to Return $9B of Stolen BTC to Bitfinex\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has determined that crypto exchange Bitfinex is the rightful owner of funds recovered following a hack in August 2016 in which nearly 120,000 BTC, valued at about $70 million at the time, was stolen.\n\nIn a motion submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Jan. 14, government attorneys called for a voluntary restitution of 94,643 BTC, worth more than $9 billion, to Bitfinex.\n\nThe funds were recovered from Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, both of whom were arrested and convicted in 2022.\n\nThe recovered funds represent the coins left in the hackers‚Äô wallet, while 25,000 BTC was withdrawn by Lichtenstein years ago and laundered using various methods.\n\n‚ÄúBecause of the complexity of the laundering transactions, these remaining assets cannot be characterized as ‚Äòthe specific property lost‚Äô by Bitfinex and/or its accountholders,‚Äù the filing read.\n\nPhoto by Choong Deng Xiang on Unsplash\nBitMEX Fined Another $100M for AML, KYC Failures\n\nCrypto exchange BitMEX has been ordered to pay an additional $100 million for violating the U.S.‚Äôs Bank Secrecy Act by failing to implement anti-money laundering and know-your-customer programs.\n\nThe act requires financial institutions to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering.\n\nThe settlement resolves a legal battle that began in October 2020, when U.S. authorities filed civil and criminal charges against the company and its founders.\n\nBitMEX said it was ‚Äúdisappointed to learn of the imposition of an additional financial penalty,‚Äù but noted that the amount was ‚Äúsubstantially less‚Äù than the $420 million the U.S. Department of Justice had originally sought three years ago.\n\nPhoto by Maxim Hopman on Unsplash\nSEC Petitions Appeals Court to Overturn Initial XRP Ruling\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed an opening brief appealing a previous court ruling that found Ripple-issued XRP was not classified as a security when it was sold to retail investors.\n\nIn 2023, Judge Analisa Torres determined that XRP was a security when it was sold to institutions but not when it was sold to retail investors through exchanges.\n\nThe SEC wants the Second Circuit Appeals Court to rule that a New York district court was wrong to rule that both institutional and retail XRP sales qualified as investment contracts under the Howey test, which determines what assets are investment contracts, potentially subjecting them to U.S. securities laws.\n\n‚ÄúAs expected, the SEC‚Äôs appeal brief is a rehash of already failed arguments ‚Äî and likely to be abandoned by the next administration,‚Äù Ripple‚Äôs chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, wrote on X.\n\nEarn 20%+ APR on ETH with High Growth

Young and Tikta\nCrypto Traders Smell Recovery as FARTCOIN Rises\n\nPrice gains in the artificial intelligence memecoin FARTCOIN on Tuesday had crypto traders scenting a market recovery.\n\nAfter a steep plunge in memecoin prices on Monday, the FARTCOIN token jumped 13.8% in the following 24-hour period.\n\nIt was a sweet-smelling turnaround, since the price gains pushed the market capitalization of the cryptocurrency ‚Äî created a few months ago as a joke inspired by an AI chatbot ‚Äî back over $1 billion.\n\nAnother popular memecoin, dogecoin, gained 10% and was changing hands for around 35 cents to 36 cents, the token‚Äôs highest price in seven days.\n\nBitcoin, ethereum, XRP, and solana each rose by at least 5%.\n\nSEC ‚ÄôNever Said‚Äô Bitcoin and Ether are Securities: Gary Gensler\n\nGary Gensler, the outgoing chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, says the regulator has never described bitcoin and ether as securities.\n\n‚ÄúI said that we, the SEC, have never said they're securities,‚Äù Gensler said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\n\nGensler‚Äôs stance on ether, specifically, hasn‚Äôt always been clear. In a 2023 hearing before the House Financial Services Committee, he struggled to give lawmakers a straight answer when pressed on the question.\n\nAccording to Fox Business, filings from the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit against Consensys seem to imply that Gensler and the SEC believed that ether was an unregistered security for at least a year.\n\n(Shutterstock)\nSky‚Äôs Spark Protocol to Allocate $1.1B to Ethena‚Äôs USDe\n\nSpark, a lending subDAO of Sky ‚Äî formerly MakerDAO ‚Äî on Tuesday approved the integration of Ethena's USDe and sUSDe tokens into its Spark Liquidity Layer.\n\nWith a planned direct allocation of up to $1.1 billion in the short term, the integration will allow Spark to receive Ethena rewards directly without going through lending markets.\n\nUntil recently, the Spark Liquidity Layer balance sheet included only two stablecoins: Circle‚Äôs USDC and Sky‚Äôs sUSDS.\n\nEthena's USDe stablecoin currently has a market cap of more than $5.79 billion, making it the fourth-largest in the space.\n\n‚ÄúEthena wouldn't be where it is today without the early support of Sky Ecosystem and Spark from the very early days,‚Äù Ethena founder Guy Young wrote on X.\n\nMaple Finance Considers Token Buybacks\n\nDecentralized lending protocol Maple Finance proposed a token buyback initiative to enhance benefits for stakers of its native token, SYRUP.\n\nIn a proposal floated on Maple‚Äôs governance forum, the team called for using 20% of protocol revenue to fund token buybacks from decentralized exchanges and over-the-counter trading desks.\n\nThe rewards from repurchased tokens would be distributed to SYRUP stakers via smart contracts, while the remaining 80% of inflation would remain in the DAO treasury to fund strategic initiatives.\n\nMaple said it has been earning around $5 million in annualized revenues from its onchain lending service.\n\nToken holders will begin voting on whether to implement the proposal on Jan. 20.\n\nPhoto by Andres Perez on Unsplash\nTrump‚Äôs Digital Asset Czar to Host VIP Reception at ‚ÄòCrypto Ball‚Äô\n\nAn inaugural ‚Äúcrypto ball‚Äù is set to take place on Jan. 17 at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington D.C.\n\nThe black-tie event celebrating the inauguration of incoming president Donald Trump, who is not expected to be in attendance, will feature a VIP reception hosted by David Sacks, the incoming White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar, and Trump super PAC MAGA Inc., according to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett.\n\nIt is being presented by lobbyists BTC Inc. and Stand With Crypto, and is backed by big names in the digital asset space including Coinbase, MicroStrategy, and Galaxy Digital.\n\nGeneral admission is priced at $2,500 a head, while VIP access is on offer for $100,000, according to Terret. A package of four tickets that includes a single ticket for a dinner with Trump at a later date costs $1 million.\n\nThe ball marks a turning point in the historically prickly relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and Washington.\n\nPhoto by Library of Congress on Unsplash\n\nEarn 20%+ APR on ETH with High Growth Vault by Kelp\n\nHigh Gain is your tokenized solution for generating the highest rewards on ETH in 1 click‚Äì while keeping you liquid with hgETH.\n\nDeposit Now!\n\nDaily Bits‚Ä¶ ‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è‚úç\n\nü§ù Crypto derivatives exchange Deribit confirmed receiving strategic investment inquiries, with valuation estimates reaching $4 billion-$5 billion, while dismissing rumors of an outright sale amid heightened crypto M&A activity.\n\nüíæ A British judge ruled against a request by a man who mistakenly threw out a hard drive with private keys to 8,000 bitcoin worth $760 million to excavate the landfill he says it‚Äôs in, ruling that the town of Newport, where the landfill is located, now owns the drive.\n\nüá∫üá∏ The TON blockchain, linked to Telegram, announced plans to target U.S. growth under incoming president Donald Trump, citing a crypto-friendly environment and having grown its ecosystem to 1.2 million daily transactions and 1,400 dApps.\n\nü§ñ Investment firm Franklin Templeton on Tuesday highlighted the potential of AI agents in blockchains as tokens such as AI16z and Virtuals Protocol surged, with AI16z gaining 18% in 24 hours and trading at $1.30 amid increased market interest.\n\nüè¶ Rep.

Young and Tikta\nSEC Ordered to Give Coinbase Reasons for Denying Rulemaking Petition\n\nA U.S. federal appellate court yesterday ordered the Securities and Exchange Commission to explain its decision to deny a petition filed by Coinbase for clear cryptocurrency regulations.\n\nIn a ruling on Monday, a three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit determined that the SEC‚Äôs order had acted in a way that had been ‚Äúarbitrary and capricious,‚Äù granting Coinbases‚Äôs petition in part and and remanding the matter to the SEC for a ‚Äúmore complete explanation.‚Äù\n\nCoinbase petitioned the SEC in July 2022 to provide clarity on how securities laws apply to digital assets and to develop regulatory frameworks for the crypto industry.\n\nAlthough the court did not order the SEC to implement new crypto-specific rules, the ruling was largely considered a win for the digital asset industry.\n\n‚ÄúThe SEC repeatedly sues crypto companies for not complying with the law, yet it will not tell them how to comply,‚Äù the court said. ‚ÄúThat caginess creates a serious constitutional problem; due process guarantees fair notice.‚Äù\n\nPhoto by PiggyBank on Unsplash\nGripes Spur Ethereum to Post More on Social Media\n\nAfter Ethereum community members criticized the network‚Äôs lack of online marketing, namely on X, the Ethereum Foundation ‚Äî the non-profit organization of teams supporting the Ethereum ecosystem ‚Äî announced a new approach to the network‚Äôs ‚Äúsocial layer,‚Äù a.k.a. its social media presence.\n\nOn early Monday, not only did the foundation unveil a new X account ‚Äî @EthereumFndn ‚Äî but the handle @Ethereum, which rarely writes its own posts, tweeted: ‚Äúhello world computer.‚Äù\n\n@EthereumFndn aims to share updates from the foundation‚Äôs teams on projects and grants, and disclosures about treasury movements, while the @Ethereum handle will be more active as a general account, the foundation announced on X, adding that the changes had also been launched on other social networks such as Farcaster, Lens, and Bluesky.\n\nTrump Likely to Repeal Crypto Policies on Day One of Term: Report\n\nIncoming president Donald Trump is expected to undo some controversial measures that ‚Äúsecretly de-banked‚Äù several crypto firms last year.\n\nTrump is looking to sign executive orders on the first day of his presidency to address issues such as de-banking, according to a report by the Washington Post.\n\nThe president-elect is also considering a repeal of a crypto accounting policy that requires banks holding digital assets to count them as liabilities, an unnamed source told the Post.\n\nIndustry watchers have taken aim at the Biden administration for cutting off the crypto industry‚Äôs access to banking services, labelling it a coordinated effort dubbed ‚ÄúOperation Chokepoint 2.0.‚Äù\n\nPhoto by History in HD on Unsplash\nTether Finalizes Move to El Salvador\n\nTether, the company behind the world's biggest stablecoin, USDT, is set to complete all the formalities for relocating its headquarters to El Salvador.\n\nThe move comes after Tether obtained a digital asset service provider license and approval as a stablecoin issuer in the country.\n\nTether cited El Salvador‚Äôs ‚Äúforward-thinking policies, favorable regulatory environment, and a growing Bitcoin-savvy community‚Äù reasons for the move.\n\nTether also plans to establish its first physical headquarters in El Salvador and aims to hire 100 Salvadorans in the coming years.\n\nPhoto by Esteban Bonilla on Unsplash\nBitcoin‚Äôs Dip Below $90,000 Triggers $700M of Liquidations\n\nBitcoin dipped to an intraday low of $89,260 on Monday as economists pared back expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut.\n\nThe original digital asset had recovered to around $94,800 at the time of writing, marking a gain of around 0.73% over the previous 24 hours.\n\nMonday‚Äôs volatility triggered more than $700 million of crypto liquidations. Those betting on a higher bitcoin price felt the most pain, with long traders clocking liquidations of $516 million, according to data from crypto futures trading platform CoinGlass.\n\nThe funding rate across major exchanges, which serves as an indicator of market sentiment, was marginally positive on exchanges such as Binance and OKX as of press time.\n\nEarn 20%+ APR on ETH with High Growth Vault by Kelp\n\nHigh Gain is your tokenized solution for generating the highest rewards on ETH in 1 click‚Äì while keeping you liquid with hgETH.\n\nDeposit Now!\n\nDaily Bits‚Ä¶ ‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è‚úç\n\n‚öñÔ∏è The U.S. Supreme Court denied Binance‚Äôs petition to review a ruling enforcing U.S. securities laws on its operations, asserting jurisdiction based on services provided to American clients.\n\nüéÆ Sony launched Soneium, a layer 2 blockchain using Optimism‚Äôs OP Stack, designed to bridge Web2 and Web3 audiences for applications in gaming, finance, and entertainment.\n\nüö´ However, the Soneium blockchain faced backlash for blacklisting memecoins over intellectual property concerns, sparking debate on the balance between permissionless networks and IP enforcement.\n\nüí∞ MicroStrategy acquired 2,530 BTC for $243 million at an average price of $95,972 per bitcoin, boosting its holdings to 450,000 BTC worth more than $40 billion, with purchases funded through share sales and debt offerings.\n\nüíé Digital anime brand Azuki announced its ANIME token, allocating 50.5% to the community, spiking Azuki NFT prices by 9.1%, with plans for an AnimeDAO to fund initiatives and launch a dedicated animecoin platform.\n\nüìä Celestia‚Äôs blob sizes surged 10 times to 11.4 GB, driven by NFT mints and integrations with Eclipse and RARI, while daily transactions rose 60% to 71,000, highlighting growing ecosystem activity.\n\nToday in Crypto Adoption...\n\nüí± BlackRock‚Äôs Canadian Bitcoin ETF, trading as IBIT (CAD) and IBIT.U (USD), launched to simplify Bitcoin exposure for investors, offering holdings through tax-advantaged accounts and linking to the U.S. iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF.\n\nüè¶ Italy‚Äôs largest bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, purchased 11 BTC worth $1 million, marking its first bitcoin acquisition and further integrating digital assets into its proprietary trading operations.\n\nThe $$$ Corner‚Ä¶\n\nüí≥ Crypto trading platform MoonPay acquired Solana-based Helio in a $175 million all-equity deal, aiming to expand its crypto payment services and integrate e-commerce payment solutions such as Helio‚Äôs Shopify plugin.\n\nüõ°Ô∏è Chainalysis acquired Israeli fraud detection startup Alterya for $150 million, combining their tools to expand capabilities for identifying and preventing crypto-related scams.\n\nüåü Sygnum Bank raised $58 million, achieving unicorn status with a valuation of more than $1 billion, aiming to expand bitcoin-focused financial products and strengthen its global regulatory footprint.\n\nüåê Dubai-based Sigma Capital launched a $100 million Web3 fund focused on DeFi, tokenization, and blockchain infrastructure, leveraging the UAE‚Äôs status as a global crypto hub to attract innovative startups.\n\nWhat Do You Meme?\nüìà Your Market Update üìâ\n\nBTC is up 5.6%, trading at $95,970\n\nETH is up 4.3%, trading at $3,183\n\nBTC dominance: 54.89%\n\nCrypto market cap: $3.46T\n\n*All data as of today, 08:00 am ET.

However, critics argue the token launch unfairly benefited a select group of insiders.\n\nMuch of the community‚Äôs ire was focused on the cohosts of crypto podcast Bankless for selling their tokens and on their early-stage Web3 venture fund Bankless Ventures, which sold 10% of its allocation shortly after the launch, sparking accusations of cashing in on the project‚Äôs rapid success.\n\nFacing criticism, Bankless co-founder David Hoffman called the sale ‚Äúan impulsive mistake‚Äù and said the tokens had been repurchased.\n\nThe DAO‚Äôs co-founders pledged to implement vesting schedules to prevent future abuses, but the damage to trust has been done.\n\nUsual Protocol Brings Forward Revenue Switch After USD0++ Depeg\n\nDecentralized stablecoin platform Usual Protocol addressed concerns over an unexpected change to the code governing its stablecoin, USD0++, which caused it to depeg on Jan. 9.\n\nUsual now plans to introduce new features such as 1:1 early unstaking, which will allow users to claim USD0++ at the pegged $1 rate while forfeiting earned rewards.\n\nThe protocol also brought forward the activation of a revenue switch that will distribute a potential $5 million to all USUALX holders on a monthly basis.\n\nInvestors were caught off guard when Usual introduced a new floor price of $0.87 for USD0++ redemptions, replacing the previous 1:1 exchange rate with USD0. The change triggered large-scale liquidations and liquidity shifts on platforms including Curve Finance and Pendle.\n\n‚ÄúThe current situation regarding USD0++ stems from a misunderstanding of the protocol‚Äôs mechanisms along with a communication that should have been better articulated,‚Äù the Usual team said.\n\nPhoto by Ibrahim Rifath on Unsplash\nMango Markets to Shut Down\n\nSolana-based decentralized exchange Mango Markets is shutting down following a series of legal and financial challenges.\n\nThe platform announced its closure with a unanimous governance vote, setting 8 p.m. UTC on Jan. 13 as the deadline for users to exit their positions.\n\n‚ÄúMango v4 & Boost are winding down,‚Äù the Mango Markets team said on X. ‚ÄúMost borrowing on Mango will be economically unviable going forward.‚Äù\n\nThe shutdown follows a significant settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that required Mango Markets and the Blockworks Foundation to pay $700,000 in civil penalties and destroy MNGO tokens.\n\nThe platform was also impacted by a major exploit in October 2022 in which trader Avraham Eisenberg manipulated the MNGO token‚Äôs price and drained $117 million from the protocol.\n\nPhoto by Yoel Winkler on Unsplash\nMixer Operators Face Money Laundering Charges\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has indicted three Russian nationals for operating cryptocurrency mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, which were allegedly used to launder illicit funds.\n\nRoman Vitalyevich Ostapenko and Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik were arrested on Dec. 1, while Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov remains at large.\n\nBlender.io operated from 2018 to 2022, and Sinbad.io is believed to have been its successor, launching in October 2022.\n\nBoth platforms were linked to the North Korean hacking group Lazarus, and allegedly played a role in helping it launder millions in stolen cryptocurrency.\n\nPhoto by Maxim Tolchinskiy on Unsplash\nSingapore Bans Polymarket, Labels it ‚ÄòIllegal Gambling Site‚Äô\n\nSingapore has banned decentralized betting platform Polymarket.\n\nThe nation-state restricted access to Polymarket‚Äôs website, redirecting users to a message from the Gambling Regulatory Authority.\n\n‚ÄúYou have attempted to access an illegal gambling site hosted by an unlicensed gambling service provider,‚Äù the notice reads.\n\nThe ban is part of a broader crackdown on unlicensed online gambling in Singapore. The country currently restricts online gambling to state-approved operators, with Singapore Pools being the sole licensed provider.\n\nEarn 20%+ APR on ETH with High Growth Vault by Kelp\n\nHigh Gain is your tokenized solution for generating the highest rewards on ETH in 1 click‚Äì while keeping you liquid with hgETH.\n\nDeposit Now!\n\nDaily Bits‚Ä¶ ‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è‚úç\n\nüéØ New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against unnamed crypto scammers who stole $2.2 million from fake job offers, serving the accused parties via an NFT airdrop into their digital wallets.\n\nüé§ Heather \"Razzlekhan\" Morgan released a final music video, \"Razzlekhan vs. The United States,\" reflecting on her crypto money-laundering case before starting her 18-month prison sentence for laundering stolen Bitfinex bitcoin.\n\n‚úÇÔ∏èBlockchain research firm Messari laid off 15% of its staff amid a wave of crypto industry cuts, citing efforts to streamline operations and focus on its core product growth.\n\n‚öñÔ∏è Outgoing U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Enforcement Director Ian McGinley, known for leading cases against Binance, KuCoin, and FTX, is stepping down, paving the way for potential shifts in the agency‚Äôs crypto enforcement agenda under new leadership.\n\nToday in Crypto Adoption...\n\nüåç Kenya‚Äôs Treasury announced plans to legalize cryptocurrencies, aiming to capitalize on their financial potential while addressing risks such as fraud, money laundering, and terrorism financing.\n\nüá≠üá∞ The Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched a supervisory incubator to help banks adopt blockchain technology safely, focusing on tokenized deposits and managing risks in integrating distributed ledger systems with legacy infrastructure.\n\nWhat Do You Meme?\nüìà Your Market Update üìâ\n\nBTC is down 3.7%, trading at $90,793\n\nETH is down 5.9%, trading at $3,055\n\nBTC dominance: 54.83%\n\nCrypto market cap: $3.28T\n\n*All data as of today, 07:57 am ET.

Travis Kling weighs in on the DOJ‚Äôs BTC stash, the rise of AI agents, and more.\n\nIt‚Äôs been a tough week for the markets, with bitcoin gyrating from $102,400 to $92,000.\n\nTravis Kling, CIO of Ikigai Asset Management, shares his thoughts on the selloff, whether this market dip is a cause for alarm, and how macro factors like the Fed‚Äôs rate policy and ETF dynamics are shaping the landscape.\n\nPlus, he dives into the explosive growth of AI agents and why crypto investors should start paying attention to this new frontier. Could AI agents revolutionize crypto, or are we witnessing another bubble?\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nWeekly News Recap\nU.S. Court Clears Sale of $6.5 Billion in Seized Bitcoin From Silk Road Case\n\nA U.S. federal court has approved the sale of 69,370 bitcoin, valued at approximately $6.5 billion, seized from wallets tied to the notorious Silk Road darknet marketplace. The decision, handed down by Chief U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in the Northern District of California, marks a significant milestone in one of the largest cryptocurrency forfeitures in history.\n\nThe ruling denies attempts to block the Department of Justice (DOJ) from liquidating the assets, following a legal battle spanning four years. According to court documents filed on December 30, the bitcoin was confiscated as part of efforts to dismantle the illegal operations of Silk Road.\n\nWhile the DOJ has yet to comment on the ruling, the sale is expected to undergo administrative processes required under federal asset forfeiture laws.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\nDo Kwon‚Äôs Trial Scheduled for January 2026\n\nThe criminal trial of Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon, accused of orchestrating a $40 billion crypto collapse, has been set for January 26, 2026, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Paul Engelmayer called the timeline \"unprecedented\" but granted the defense‚Äôs request for additional preparation time due to Kwon‚Äôs extensive legal challenges in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nKwon faces nine felony charges, including securities fraud and money laundering conspiracy, stemming from the failure of the TerraUST stablecoin in 2022. Prosecutors allege Kwon knowingly misrepresented the system‚Äôs stability, likening his actions to building a ‚ÄúPotemkin village.‚Äù\n\nThe U.S. government has revealed that the alleged fraud may have impacted over one million individuals and entities worldwide. A website will be established to inform victims of legal proceedings, with opportunities for them to participate. If convicted, Kwon could face up to 130 years in prison.\n\nIn related news, a federal judge postponed the sentencing of Avi Eisenberg, who was convicted for exploiting decentralized exchange Mango Markets, to April 10. The judge cited the case‚Äôs complexity and the need for additional review of sentencing issues when making the postponement decision.\n\nPhoto by Colin Lloyd on Unsplash\nHyperliquid Addresses Concerns Over Validator Transparency and Centralization\n\nHyperliquid, a decentralized perpetual futures exchange, has responded to growing community concerns about its validator network. Critics raised issues of potential centralization, lack of transparency, and allegations that validator seats were being sold‚Äîa claim the Hyper Foundation firmly denies.\n\nIn a statement shared on X, the Hyper Foundation clarified that all 16 validators currently active were selected based on their performance during the testnet phase. ‚ÄúThere is no way to buy a seat at the table,‚Äù the post emphasized, calling such accusations a disservice to the validators‚Äô contributions.\n\nConcerns over centralization persist as five validators under the foundation‚Äôs control manage over 81% of the staked HYPE tokens. The foundation acknowledged the issue, announcing a delegation program to redistribute tokens and promote decentralization.\n\nHyperliquid also addressed complaints about its closed-source node code, pledging to make it public once network security is ensured.\n\nCoinbase Scores Rare Victory as Court Pauses SEC Lawsuit\n\nIn a significant legal development, Judge Katherine Polk Failla has granted Coinbase‚Äôs request for an interlocutory appeal in its case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This ruling pauses proceedings while the Second Circuit Court of Appeals considers whether the SEC‚Äôs allegations fall under existing securities laws.\n\nJudge Failla acknowledged the complexity of applying traditional securities tests, like the Howey Test, to digital assets, calling it an ‚Äúissue of first impression‚Äù requiring higher court guidance. ‚ÄúConflicting authority exists regarding Howey‚Äôs application to crypto-assets,‚Äù she wrote in her decision.\n\nThe case centers on whether certain crypto assets sold on Coinbase qualify as securities. If the second circuit takes up the appeal, it could shape the regulatory future of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nAmanda Tuminelli of the DeFi Education Fund described the ruling as ‚Äúa potentially pivotal moment‚Äù that could bring long-awaited legal clarity to digital asset regulation.\n\nPhoto by Wesley Tingey on Unsplash\nFTX Challenges Backpack‚Äôs Acquisition of Its European Arm\n\nThe FTX bankruptcy estate has disputed the legitimacy of crypto exchange Backpack‚Äôs acquisition of FTX EU, claiming it was neither authorized by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court nor conducted with FTX‚Äôs knowledge. Backpack, which is a crypto exchange and wallet firm founded by former FTX and Alameda employees, announced the purchase on January 7, along with plans to repay FTX EU creditors and launch regulated crypto derivatives services.\n\nIn a statement, FTX emphasized that Backpack ‚Äúhas not been authorized to make any distributions to FTX customers or other creditors,‚Äù contradicting Backpack‚Äôs assertion that it could begin repayments as early as February.\n\nBackpack countered FTX‚Äôs statement by citing approval from Cyprus‚Äôs financial regulator, CySec, and confirmed that the acquisition was finalized in June 2024. However, FTX maintains that it was unaware of the indirect transfer of FTX EU and insists that creditor repayments remain under court jurisdiction.\n\nPhoto by Mariia Shalabaieva on Unsplash\nGemini Settles CFTC Lawsuit Over False Claims With $5 Million Fine\n\nCrypto exchange Gemini, led by identical twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, has agreed to pay a $5 million fine to resolve allegations brought by the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The lawsuit, filed in June 2022, accused Gemini of making ‚Äúfalse and misleading statements‚Äù in 2017 while seeking approval for a bitcoin futures contract.\n\nThe settlement, outlined in a proposed consent order, includes a permanent injunction against Gemini. The exchange has neither admitted nor denied the allegations, a standard practice in such agreements.\n\nThis deal spares Gemini from a jury trial that had been scheduled for January 21. The consent order awaits final approval by a federal judge, bringing closure to a case that has lingered for over two years. Gemini has not yet issued a public comment on the matter.\n\nSpeaking of the CFTC, this week Chair Rostin Behnam announced his resignation, citing years of efforts to close regulatory gaps in crypto markets, including enforcement actions against major players such as FTX.\n\nPhoto by Vitaly Taranov on Unsplash\nCoinbase Explores Tokenizing Its Stock on Base\n\nCoinbase, the largest publicly traded crypto exchange in the U.S., is considering making its Nasdaq-listed stock, COIN, available as a tokenized asset on its layer 2 blockchain network, Base. Jesse Pollak, head of Base and Coinbase Wallet, revealed the initiative is in an exploratory phase, emphasizing the need for regulatory compliance.\n\n‚ÄúWe are working to understand what needs to be unlocked from a regulatory perspective to bring assets like $COIN to Base in a safe, compliant, future-looking way,‚Äù Pollak stated on X. While tokenized COIN shares are already accessible to non-U.S. users via decentralized platforms, expanding access domestically hinges on clearer U.S. regulations.\n\nPhantom Dismisses Token Rumors\n\nPhantom, a popular non-custodial crypto wallet, has denied rumors of an impending token launch following its announcement of a social discovery feature. The feature, revealed on December 19, will allow users to create profiles, add friends, and choose privacy settings, sparking speculation about potential token rewards for gaining followers.\n\nAddressing the rumors, Phantom stated on X, ‚ÄúWe do not have any plans to launch a token,‚Äù while emphasizing their enthusiasm for the new feature. The company also highlighted ongoing efforts to enhance the social experience for its users.\n\nMARA Deploys 16% of Bitcoin Reserves Into Lending Program\n\nBitcoin mining giant MARA has disclosed that 7,377 BTC, representing 16% of its reserves, has been loaned to third parties as part of a lending program. Valued at approximately $730 million, the loans aim to generate a ‚Äúmodest single-digit yield‚Äù to offset operating expenses, according to MARA‚Äôs head of investor relations, Robert Samuels.\n\nThe lending program, which has been active throughout 2024, involves short-term arrangements with established partners, though borrower details remain undisclosed.\n\nMARA‚Äôs reserves now total 44,893 BTC, worth $4.2 billion, bolstered by mining operations and strategic purchases. The company also surpassed its hash rate target of 50 EH/s, achieving 53.2 EH/s by year-end.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\nüòÇ Fun Bits: Justin Sun Reelected Prime Minister of‚Ä¶ Wait, Where?\n\nJustin Sun has secured another victory as prime minister of Liberland, the micronation that claims seven square kilometers of disputed land between Serbia and Croatia. If you‚Äôre wondering how Sun found time between crypto controversies and banana art-eating stunts to become prime minister, you‚Äôre not alone.\n\nSun‚Äôs pitch to Liberland‚Äôs president included forging ties with the U.S. and, oddly enough, aligning with Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù policies. Sun even hinted at chatting with Eric Trump during the inauguration. Bold plans for a nation no one officially recognizes!\n\nLiberland‚Äôs goals include luring crypto-loving digital nomads. Whether Sun will succeed or just rename Bitcoin as ‚ÄúSunCoin‚Äù in Liberland remains to be seen. For now, Liberland is a tiny patch of land with a lot of ambition‚Äîand one very ambitious prime minister.\n\nWatch the Recap!\n\nTo stay updated with everything that‚Äôs going on in crypto, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nSubscribe\n2\nShare",

Young, Veronica Irwin and Tikta\nBitcoin Slides for 3rd Day, Erasing Year‚Äôs Gains\n\nThe crypto market has erased this year‚Äôs gains after a three-day selloff fueled by strength in the U.S. dollar and a judge‚Äôs decision to let the federal government sell some of its own bitcoin holdings.\n\nThe OG crypto dipped below $92,000 on Binance on Thursday, setting a new low for the year and distancing its price from December‚Äôs record high of around $108,000.\n\nThe retreat contributed to a pullback in digital assets that had jumped in price in recent weeks, including memecoins and other tokens associated with artificial intelligence-powered chatbots and platforms.\n\nCrypto-Friendly Summer Mersinger Becomes Top Contender for CFTC Chair\n\nSitting Commodity Futures Trading Commission member Summer Mersinger is now the leading contender to chair the regulator, according to five sources close to the deliberations.\n\nIn the new year, Mersinger has gained an edge over the former favorite, a16z crypto Head of Policy Brian Quintenz as she is seen as a choice that could help Trump win favor with a Senate led by South Dakota Republican John Thune.\n\nAlthough the CFTC, which oversees commodities markets, typically receives less attention than the Securities and Exchange Commission, it could become the primary agency overseeing crypto within its next chair‚Äôs tenure.\n\nPrevious iterations of a crypto market structure bill have made the CFTC crypto‚Äôs primary regulator, and policy advocates speculate that a similar bill could be passed before the midterm elections in two years.\n\nCoinbase Subpoenaed for Polymarket-Related Customer Data\n\nThe U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has served Coinbase with a subpoena requiring it to hand over ‚Äúgeneral customer information‚Äù related to its investigation of decentralized betting market Polymarket.\n\nEric Conner, founder of open-source Ethereum research platform ETHHub, posted a screenshot of an email Coinbase sent to its customers notifying them of the subpoena.\n\nThe U.S. exchange said it ‚Äúmay be required to send information‚Äù about users‚Äô accounts to the CFTC.\n\nThe CFTC launched enforcement action against Polymarket in 2022 over the platform‚Äôs failure to register its services with the regulator. Following a $1.4 million settlement, Polymarket closed its doors to U.S. citizens.\n\nPhoto by PiggyBank on Unsplash\nBitcoin Dives After Hawkish Fed Comment\n\nBitcoin dropped to an intraday low of $91,220 on Thursday after the markets digested a more hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve‚Äôs December meeting minutes released the previous day.\n\nThe Fed noted that the risks of higher inflation are on the rise, suggesting there will be fewer rate cuts this year.\n\nISM data released earlier in the week told the same story ‚Äî ISM, which is a lead indicator for the consumer price index, showed that prices paid by purchasing managers were at a 22-month high.\n\nNews on Wednesday that a federal judge had granted the U.S. Department of Justice the right to sell 69,000 BTC also likely had an impact on the bitcoin‚Äôs price amid fears that the government was looking to sell that cache, worth around $6.5 billion.\n\nHowever, federal asset forfeiture typically requires additional administrative steps, and onchain data show that no sale of that kind has yet been made.\n\nPhoto by Alex Bierwagen on Unsplash\nCircle Gives $1M to Donald Trump‚Äôs Inauguration Committee\n\nJeremy Allaire, CEO of stablecoin issuer Circle, says the firm has contributed $1 million of its stablecoin, USDC, to Donald Trump's inaugural committee.\n\n‚ÄúWe are excited to be building a great American company, and the fact that the Committee took payment in USDC is an indicator of how far we have come, and the potential and power of digital dollars,‚Äù Allaire said in a statement posted on X.\n\nCircle is one of the many businesses looking to curry favor with the incoming president before his inauguration on Jan. 20.\n\nUSDC accounts for $41 billion of the $203 billion in global stablecoin market cap. Rival issuer Tether‚Äôs USDT accounts for $136 billion.\n\nAvalon Labs Plans AVL Token Launch\n\nAvalon Labs, the entity behind bitcoin-backed stablecoin USDa, says it plans to launch its own native governance token, AVL.\n\nAvalon will airdrop 20% of the AVL token supply to reward its early users, who will also be able to participate in governance and stake their tokens in different pools.\n\nThose who stake tokens will also be eligible for fee rebates on Avalon‚Äôs USDa and CeDeFi lending platform.\n\nAVL will have a total supply of 1 billion tokens, with 30% earmarked for community incentives, 18% for investors and 10% for the project team.\n\nEarn 20%+ APR on ETH with High Growth Vault by Kelp\n\nHigh Gain is your tokenized solution for generating the highest rewards on ETH in 1 click‚Äì while keeping you liquid with hgETH.\n\nDeposit Now!\n\nDaily Bits‚Ä¶ ‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è‚úç\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Usual Money‚Äôs staked USD0++ dropped to $0.915, 8.5% below its $1 peg, after a protocol update introduced a dual-exit mechanism with a $0.87 floor price, sparking community backlash and causing liquidity imbalances in Curve pools.\n\nüèõÔ∏è Sen.

    "content": "Discover more from Unchained\nYour no-hype resource for all things crypto\nOver 17,000 subscribers\nBy subscribing, I agree to Substack's Terms of Use, and acknowledge its Information Collection Notice and Privacy Policy.\nSubscribe\nContinue reading\nSign in\nTRADGOV (PREVIOUSLY UNREGULATED)\nA Shake-Up in the CFTC Chair Shortlist üåΩü™ë\nThe top two contenders have switched places.\nVERONICA IRWIN\nJAN 09, 2025\n2\nShare\n\nHey! I‚Äôm Veronica Irwin, Unchained‚Äôs regulatory reporter.\n\nThe CFTC Chair selection process has taken quite a while, hasn‚Äôt it?¬†\n\nA month ago, we were the first to report that Brian Quintenz was the top contender, closely followed by Summer Mersinger. Several other outlets confirmed my reporting in the following days. At the time, it seemed all but certain that Trump would announce his pick for the role at any moment ‚Äî I spent all of the holiday break with Truth Social notifications on, jumping in my seat every time I received the alert that ‚Äú@realDonaldTrump just posted.‚Äù¬†\n\nBut as time went by, it became clearer and clearer that something was up. As it turns out, the Trump transition team is still researching who would be the best pick, diving deep into the contenders‚Äô backgrounds and gathering feedback.¬†\n\nNot too much has changed in terms of who is in the running ‚Äî but the order by favorability has switched around.¬†\n\nCrypto-Friendly Summer Mersinger Is Now the Top Contender for CFTC Chair\nSummer Mersinger was a top aide to Senator Thune for 12 years (CFTC)\n\nSitting CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger is now the leading contender to chair the CFTC, according to five sources close to the deliberations.¬†\n\nIn the new year, Mersinger has gained an edge over the former favorite, a16z crypto Head of Policy Brian Quintenz, as she is seen as a choice who could help Trump curry favor with a Senate led by South Dakota Republican John Thune.¬†\n\nThough the CFTC, which oversees commodities markets, often receives less attention than the SEC, which oversees securities, it could become the primary agency overseeing crypto within the next CFTC chair‚Äôs tenure. Previous iterations of a crypto market structure bill have made the CFTC crypto‚Äôs primary regulator, and policy advocates speculate that a similar bill could be passed before the midterm elections in two years.\n\nWatch: Kristin Smith on Why This Is Crypto‚Äôs Time to ‚ÄòGet Policy Done‚Äô\n\nWhy Mersinger‚Äôs Name Has Risen to the Top\n\nMersinger has gained interest because of her ties to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, for whom she was a staffer from 2004 to 2016.¬†\n\nSeveral of Trump‚Äôs cabinet nominees are facing tough confirmations in the Senate, sources explained, and appointing Mersinger could help Trump stay in Thune‚Äôs good graces.¬†\n\nAdditionally, because Mersinger is already a commissioner, she can simply be appointed to the interim chair position on January 20th, rather than needing to first go through the Senate confirmation process like Quintenz would as a private citizen. To become the permanent chair, however, she will need the Senate‚Äôs consent.¬†\n\nWhy Quintenz‚Äôs Fortunes Are Flagging¬†\n\nQuintenz had been seen as the top contender before the holidays, largely because of his even closer ties to the industry due to his work at a16z crypto as well as his membership on the board of directors at prediction market Kalshi, a competitor to Polymarket.¬†\n\nRead More: Who Will Be Trump‚Äôs CFTC Chair? There‚Äôs a New Top Contender for the Role\n\nSources who spoke with Unchained also assumed Quintenz had the backing of his boss Marc Andreessen, co-founder of the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, of which a16z crypto is a part. Andreessen told The Free Press in December that he was spending about half of his time at Mar-a-Lago to help the incoming presidential administration. After Unchained first reported that Quintenz was the top contender, several other industry leaders supportive of Trump like Brian Armstrong and Chris Giancarlo said Quintenz would be a good choice for the industry.¬†\n\nHowever, excitement around Quintenz has diminished, according to the same five sources who said Mersinger was in the lead. A 2018 speech by Quintenz has gained some attention from crypto advocates, in which Quintenz argued that even back-end developers of DeFi protocols could be held liable for CFTC violations if it was reasonably foreseeable at the time of their writing the code that the tools they were creating could be misused.¬†\n\nQuintenz walked back the comments a few months later in a Coin Center blog post, and again clarified his stance in September 2023 on X. ‚ÄúThis speech did not contain my best thinking or most thought through arguments,‚Äù Quintenz explained. ‚ÄúI quickly revisited what I had said, admitted I was wrong, and published a new take that made it clear writing code should not be an offense.‚Äù¬†\n\nTwo sources also indicated that because another Andreessen pick, Sriram Krishnan, was given a position in the administration to oversee AI policy, the Trump transition team was less inclined to nominate another Silicon Valley favorite.¬†\n\nRead More: Trump Announces Team Working With AI & Crypto Czar: What We Know\n\nMersinger‚Äôs Pro-Crypto History¬†\n\nMersinger, along with fellow conservative CFTC Commissioner Caroline Pham, has become known in the crypto industry for her dissents to crypto enforcement actions that were seen as excessive or unfair. In September, Mersinger, for example, called the CFTC‚Äôs fine on Uniswap for illegal digital asset derivatives trading ‚Äúregulation through enforcement‚Äù in September, criticizing the agency for failing to first provide clarity for DeFi protocols.¬†\n\nShe also issued a dissent on the CFTCs charges against Opyn, ZeroEx, and Deridex for failing to register with the agency and illegally offering retail commodity transactions and digital assets the year prior for similar reasons, arguing that the CFTC‚Äôs aggressive posture halted innovation and pushed crypto offshore.¬†¬†\n\nAt the Solidus-run Digital Asset Compliance and Market Integrity Summit (DACOM) conference in September, Mersinger told the audience that when crypto settlements come across her desk, she‚Äôs often ‚Äúlost the opportunity to have any influence,‚Äù and is ‚Äúleft with no other choice but to dissent.‚Äù¬†\n\nThe commissioner has been seen at several crypto conferences over the past year, including Consensus, DACOM, and, most recently, the Blockchain Association Policy Summit. The appearances signal that Mersinger stays in close conversation with industry executives and lobbyists. Several such executives and lobbyists who have met Mersinger at such events told Unchained that they considered Mersinger knowledgeable about blockchain technology and aligned with industry priorities.\n\nRead More: Crypto Industry Braces for Wave of SEC, CFTC Actions as Fiscal Year Draws to a Close\n\nSeveral other former CFTC officials, such as former commissioner Jill Sommers, former director of the market participants division Josh Sterling, and former Office of the General Counsel Neal Kumar, have also been vetted. Kraken Chief Legal Officer Marco Santori is also in the mix, according to three sources. CFTC Commissioner Pham is also in contention, though three sources indicate that she is also vying for a separate position at Treasury ‚Äî an interesting twist that could leave an additional conservative slot on the commission vacant.¬†\n\nSommers and representatives for the Trump-Vance transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Quintenz, Kumar, Sterling, and representatives for Pham, Andreessen, Santori, and Mersinger declined to comment.\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nCrypto Might Get Reality Check from Friendly U.S. Congress\n\nTrump Announces Team Working With AI & Crypto Czar\n\nOhio Republican Senator Bernie Moreno to Serve on Influential Senate Banking Committee\n\nShare\n\nSubscribe\n2 Likes\n2\nShare",

Some of the materials may need to be translated from Korean.\n\nDistrict Judge Paul Engelmayer said that scheduling the start date of a trial for more than a year from the initial conference was \"unprecedented\" in his career.\n\nEngelmayer gave the defense one week to request an earlier trial this year.\n\nStarknet Rolls Out Custom Blockchain Software Suite\n\nEthereum layer 2 scaling solution Starknet unveiled a new software suite named SN Stack, aimed at enabling developers to create custom blockchains using Starknet's zero-knowledge technology.\n\nThe new tool will allow developers to create validity rollup chains with customizable parameters such as block times and sizes, utilizing proven components of Starknet including Starknet OS, CairoVM, and the Blockifier execution engine.\n\nSN Stack comes in three different configurations: a StarkWare sequencer that mirrors the public Starknet stack, app chain framework Madara and gaming-focused Dojo.\n\nThe launch positions Starknet as a competitor in the rollup stack market, alongside established players such as Optimism's OP Stack and Arbitrum's Orbit.\n\nBinance User Assets Topped $160B in 2024\n\nBinance, the world‚Äôs biggest crypto exchange, says 2024 was a record-breaking year as the custodial assets of its users topped $160 billion for the first time.\n\nIn an annual year-end report, the exchange reported having a quarter of a billion users last year, a 47% increase on the previous year.\n\nThat growth wasn‚Äôt limited to retail investors. Binance said the number of registered institutional users grew by 97% over the year.\n\nThe exchange‚Äôs cumulative historical trading volume now exceeds $100 trillion.

Victims that wish to be heard in court proceedings will be required to give prosecutors notice.\n\nDo Kwon first appeared in court on Jan. 2 after he was extradited from Montenegro to the U.S. He pleaded not guilty to nine felony charges related to fraud.\n\nGemini to Pay $5M to Settle CFTC False Claims Suit\n\nGemini, the exchange run by identical twins and crypto investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, has agreed to pay a $5 million fine to settle a lawsuit with the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), according to a report by Bloomberg.\n\nThe suit, which the CFTC brought in June 2022, alleged that Gemini had made ‚Äúfalse and misleading statements‚Äù relating to the exchange‚Äôs bid to launch a Bitcoin futures contract.\n\nUnder a proposed consent order, Gemini agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations.\n\nThe consent order, still yet to be signed by a judge, will get the brothers out of a jury trial that was due to begin on Jan. 21.\n\nPhoto by Alexander Grey on Unsplash\nCoinbase Premium Returns as Bitcoin Trades Above $101,000\n\nBitcoin‚Äôs rally past $101,800 has seen the Coinbase premium gap flip positive for the first time in three weeks, according to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst J.A. Maartunn.\n\nThe Coinbase premium measures the difference between the price of bitcoin on Coinbase and its price on non-U.S. exchanges such as Binance. It serves as an important indicator of market sentiment and buying pressure, particularly among American investors and institutions.\n\nThe other main gauge of U.S. sentiment is the amount of capital flowing into spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which also had a positive start to the week.

The Ethereum co-founder sold more memecoins on Monday, netting around $2.5 million in USDC and ETH, according to data from onchain analytics platform Arkham.\n\nButerin swapped tokens including DINU, ESTEE, and JSHIBA on trading platforms such as CoW Swap, Uniswap and Kyber Network. Since he began liquidating his holdings, DINU has lost nearly 51% of its value.\n\nThe tokens typically end up in Buterin‚Äôs wallet after being transferred to him by memecoin creators, who likely send them with the intent of gaining publicity.\n\nAs he has done in the past, Buterin donated the proceeds of his latest memecoin sale to fund his Kanro charity organization, according to onchain data.\n\nEarn 20%+ APR on ETH with High Growth Vault by Kelp\n\nHigh Gain is your tokenized solution for generating the highest rewards on ETH in 1 click‚Äì while keeping you liquid with hgETH.\n\nDeposit Now!\n\nDaily Bits‚Ä¶ ‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è‚úç\n\nüí∞ MicroStrategy has purchased 1,070 more bitcoin for $100 million, advancing an ambitious plan to raise $2 billion this quarter as part of its three-year strategy to acquire $42 billion of BTC.\n\n‚ö° Solana developers have proposed a lattice-based hashing system to address the ‚Äústate growth problem,‚Äù aiming to scale the network to billions of accounts while maintaining high security and efficiency.\n\nüèõÔ∏è Stablecoin advocate and U.S. Federal Reserve board member Michael Barr yesterday announced his resignation as the Fed‚Äôs reserve vice chair for supervision, citing concerns over potential clashes with the incoming administration of Donald Trump.\n\n‚ö°üìà Solana staking network Solayer has unveiled InfiniSVM, a hardware-accelerated blockchain solution claiming one millisecond transaction confirmation times.\n\nToday in Crypto Adoption...\n\nüá™üá∫ Four companies, including crypto trading platform MoonPay and digital asset management firm BitStaete, have obtained EU MiCA licenses in the Netherlands, giving them regulatory approval to operate across all 27 European Union countries.\n\nüáÆüá™ HashKey Group has secured virtual asset service provider approval in Ireland, enabling it to offer crypto trading and custody services as part of its global expansion strategy in key markets including Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\n‚úÖ Crypto trading firm GSR has obtained Financial Conduct Authority approval to operate as a registered crypto asset business in the UK.\n\nThe $$$ Corner‚Ä¶\n\nüéÆ Gaming layer 2 ZKcandy, powered by ZKsync, has raised $4 million in private funding to develop a Telegram-based ethereum virtual machine gaming ecosystem and artificial intelligence gaming agents, targeting a mainnet launch later this year.\n\nüíº Crypto exchange Backpack Exchange acquired FTX EU for $32.7 million, positioning itself as the only regulated perpetual futures provider in Europe, with plans to expand its crypto derivatives offerings under the MiCA framework early this year.\n\nWhat Do You Meme?\nüìà Your Market Update üìâ\n\nBTC is up 1%, trading at $100,699\n\nETH is down 0.7%, trading at $3,630\n\nBTC dominance: 53.73%\n\nCrypto market cap: $3.72T\n\n*All data as of today, 07:25 am ET.

Young, Veronica Irwin and Tikta\nBase Creators Looking at Putting COIN on L2\n\nA tokenized version of Coinbase‚Äôs stock, which trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker COIN, could soon be available on the crypto exchange‚Äôs layer 2 network, Base.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something we are looking into in the new year,‚Äù Jesse Pollak, head of Base and Coinbase Wallet, posted on X.\n\nPollak went on to clarify that ‚Äúthere are no concrete plans‚Äù as of now, and that the team was still in an exploratory phase of understanding how to bring COIN onchain in a way that would be compliant with U.S. regulations.\n\nNon-U.S. citizens can already access tokenized real-world assets such as COIN on platforms such as Backed Finance.\n\nArbitrum‚Äôs $190M Gaming Catalyst Program Ready to Go\n\nMore than six months after the Arbitrum DAO approved the use of 225 million ARB tokens worth roughly $190 million to grow the network‚Äôs gaming ecosystem, its Gaming Catalyst Program is ready to start investing and providing grants to gaming projects.\n\nThe program‚Äôs contributors have not only created an initial entity structure to support investment mandates, but have also formed a corresponding structure enabling program staffing and compensation frameworks, according to the program‚Äôs first transparency report.\n\nEthena‚Äôs Token Jumps on Plans for TradFi, Telegram Expansion\n\nEthena, a fast-growing crypto project with a synthetic dollar token positioned as an alternative to stablecoins such as Tether‚Äôs USDT, saw its token jump on Friday after founder Guy Young detailed plans for a new offering geared toward traditional financial institutions.\n\nThere‚Äôs also a planned integration with messaging platform Telegram and an expected buildout of a dedicated Ethena network.\n\nAfter Young shared a long-form blog post detailing the protocol‚Äôs 2025 roadmap, governance token ENA‚Äôs price jumped 16% to $1.23, giving the cryptocurrency a market cap of $3.6 billion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nCrypto Might Get Reality Check from Friendly U.S. Congress\n\nFollowing the opening of the 119th U.S. Congressional session last week, politicians have promised clarity on regulatory requirements for stablecoins, a framework for deciding whether crypto firms are mostly overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the Securities and Exchange Commission, and even the establishment of a bitcoin national reserve.\n\nSpiking cryptocurrency prices indicate that investors expect regulatory clarity faster than the government may be able to provide it. Policy advocates are thinking in terms of what can be passed in the next two years. While Congress may lean pro-crypto, getting a bill to the president‚Äôs desk will take time.\n\n‚ÄúWe should contextualize ‚Äòquickly,‚Äô‚Äù said Marta Belcher, president and chair of the Filecoin Foundation, which facilitates governance for the eponymous decentralized storage network. ‚ÄúQuickly is quickly for Congress, which is not quickly for what anyone in the industry would think of.‚Äù\n\n$759M of Token Unlocks Coming Up\n\nAround $759 million of token unlocks are set to hit the market over the next seven days, according to data from tokenomics platform Tokenomist.\n\nThe biggest unlocks to come will be from Aptos‚Äôs native token, APT, valued at $114 million, and Movement‚Äôs token, MOVE, valued at $54 million.\n\nIn January, the crypto market will see around $7.1 billion of token unlocks.\n\nA token unlock is the process of releasing previously locked tokens into circulation, which typically results in a drop in token price. The process is usually governed by smart contracts that automatically release tokens based on predetermined conditions or timeframes.\n\nThey can take the form of ‚Äúcliff unlocks‚Äù involving large, one-time releases of tokens, or ‚Äúlinear unlocks,‚Äù gradual, continuous distributions of tokens over time.\n\nPhoto by Radu Prodan on Unsplash\nBitcoin Miner MARA Lends 16% of BTC Reserves\n\nMajor Bitcoin mining firm MARA said in a recent production update that it had loaned 7,377 BTC from its reserves to third parties as of Dec. 31, 2024.\n\nThe amount MARA has lent amounts to roughly 16% of its total bitcoin reserves and was worth around $730 million at the time of writing. MARA‚Äôs total BTC holdings are valued at $4.2 billion.\n\nMARA‚Äôs head of investor relations, Robert Samuels, shed more light on the firm‚Äôs BTC lending program, saying it had been active throughout 2024 and had generated a ‚Äúmodest single-digit yield.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe long-term objective is to generate sufficient yield to offset operating expenses, \" Samuels said.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\nCrypto Wallet Phantom Has ‚ÄòNo Plans‚Äô to Launch Token\n\nThe team behind popular non-custodial crypto wallet Phantom poured cold water on users‚Äô hopes for an airdrop tied to its upcoming social discovery feature.\n\nAfter Phantom announced the feature, which allows users to customize profiles, follow friends, and seamlessly transfer crypto, on Dec. 19, some members of the community speculated that gaining followers could be a way of becoming eligible for token rewards.\n\n‚ÄúWe've seen some speculation about an airdrop tied to this feature, so to clarify: we do not have any plans to launch a token,‚Äù the Phantom team said on X.\n\n‚ÄúBut we're incredibly excited about social discovery on Phantom and are actively working on ways to make it something everyone loves.‚Äù\n\nEarn 20%+ APR on ETH with High Growth Vault by Kelp\n\nHigh Gain is your tokenized solution for generating the highest rewards on ETH in 1 click‚Äì while keeping you liquid with hgETH.\n\nDeposit Now!\n\nDaily Bits‚Ä¶ ‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è‚úç\n\nüìÑ Coinbase's chief legal officer has revealed unredacted Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \"pause letters,\" accusing the agency of regulatory overreach by urging banks to halt crypto-related services, sparking calls for Congressional hearings.\n\nüêõ Virtuals Protocol addressed a critical vulnerability flagged by a security researcher, quickly patching the problem and announcing plans for a bug bounty program to enhance ecosystem security.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Aave's proposal to peg Ethena's USDe to USDT raised concerns over systemic risks and conflicts of interest, as critics questioned the logic of equating assets with starkly different backing mechanisms.\n\nüìà DeFi protocols such as MakerDAO and Aave enjoyed a revenue rush in 2024, with both platforms nearing or surpassing 2021 highs, signaling a robust recovery for the sector.\n\nüìä Japanese Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet aims to expand its bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC this year, a significant increase from its current 1,761 BTC, using strategic capital market tools to strengthen its presence in the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nToday in Crypto Adoption...\n\nüåç Coinbase has expanded its European presence by acquiring mobile brokerage BUX's Cyprus unit, securing a Cyprus Investment Firm license to align with MiCA regulations and offer contracts for differences across the European Economic Area.\n\nThe $$$ Corner‚Ä¶\n\nüîí Bitcoin wallet developer JAN3 raised $5 million in seed funding to enhance its AQUA wallet, allocating $1 million to build a bitcoin treasury as it focuses on combining bitcoin saving with USDT spending functionality.\n\nWhat Do You Meme?\nüìà Your Market Update üìâ\n\nBTC is up 1.5%, trading at $99,162\n\nETH is up 0.8%, trading at $3,642\n\nBTC dominance: 53.27%\n\nCrypto market cap: $3.69T\n\n*All data as of today, 08:00 am ET.

I‚Äôm Veronica Irwin, Unchained‚Äôs regulatory reporter.\n\nWhat are your New Year‚Äôs resolutions? My list is several pages long (I always get too ambitious) and includes reading more, working out more, and journaling more.\n\nOne resolution in particular is something the whole crypto industry should probably work on ‚Äì being more patient. That‚Äôs because crypto legislation is probably going to take Congress a whole lot longer than much of the community expects.¬†\n\nCrypto Might Get Reality Check from Friendly U.S. Congress\nU.S. legislative leaders say crypto bills will be a major priority as the 119th Congress gets underway in Washington. (Kollen Post)\n\nThe 119th Congressional session begins today. Politicians have promised clarity on regulatory requirements for stablecoins, a framework for deciding whether crypto firms are mostly overseen by the CFTC or SEC, even the establishment of a bitcoin national reserve.¬†\n\nSpiking cryptocurrency prices indicate that investors expect regulatory clarity faster than the government may be able to provide it. Policy advocates are thinking in terms of what can be passed in the next two years; while Congress may lean pro-crypto, getting a bill to the president‚Äôs desk will take time.¬†\n\n‚ÄúWe should contextualize ‚Äòquickly,‚Äô‚Äù explained Marta Belcher, president and chair of the Filecoin Foundation, which facilitates governance for the decentralized storage network Filecoin. ‚ÄúQuickly is quickly for Congress, which is not quickly for what anyone in the industry would think of.‚Äù¬†\n\nMarket Structure and Stablecoins¬†\n\nTwo bills ‚Äì on stablecoins and general market structure ‚Äì occupied most of the crypto-related attention during the last Congressional session. Rep. French Hill, who leads the House Financial Services Committee, has promised to pass both bills through committee in the first 100 legislative days. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, House Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn ‚ÄúGT‚Äù Thompson, and Senate Agriculture Chair John Boozman also have expressed support for getting bills passed. Legislation would likely originate in these committees before going to floor votes. The House committees took the lead drafting legislation last session, and are expected to do so again.¬†\n\nRead More: Crypto-Savvy Rep. French Hill Will Chair House Financial Services Committee\n\nMost policy advocates expect stablecoin legislation to come first, given that Republicans and Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee nearly reached a compromise last year. The biggest contention is whether stablecoins have to be one-to-one backed by U.S. dollars, Belcher said, arguing that this requirement would be ‚Äúabove and beyond‚Äù what is asked of other sectors.¬†\n\nMarket structure legislation, meanwhile, is significantly more complex. While the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which would likely be used as a starting draft for a bill introduced this year, Republicans seem eager to use their newfound majority in the Senate as a reason to pass a bill that is more ambitious. And while FIT21 received bipartisan support in the House and Senate, three sources told Unchained last year that key Democrats like Senate minority leader (majority leader at the time) Chuck Schumer only voted ‚Äúyes‚Äù on FIT21 because they knew president Biden would veto it ‚Äî essentially, wanting to appear ‚Äúpro crypto‚Äù without actually making the bill law. This raises questions as to whether Democrats would show more resistance to a bill under a Trump presidency.¬†\n\nBitcoin Reserve\n\nLegal experts are divided on whether Trump needs the support of Congress for the Treasury to hold Bitcoin as a national reserve currency.¬†\n\nThe odds that Trump signs an executive order to accrue additional Bitcoin or convert existing Bitcoin holdings into Treasury reserves are currently less than 50%, according to Dennis Porter, who founded the Satoshi Action Fund, which advocates for pro-Bitcoin policy at the state and federal level. Things could change by inauguration day ‚Äì scheduled for Jan. 20 ‚Äì if a state approves a reserve before then, Porter said.¬†\n\nRead More: Trump Taps Hedge Fund Manager Scott Bessent to Be Treasury Secretary\n\nOptimism that a bitcoin national reserve bill will get passed and approved by Congress, however, is tepid at best. Trump‚Äôs own speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville indicated that his goal was to have the government hold bitcoin it already has in its possession, not buy more. Last year, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis‚Äô Bitcoin Reserve Legislation, which called for the Treasury to buy 200,000 bitcoins per year for the next five years, failed to gain traction.¬†\n\nCastle Island Ventures General Partner Nic Carter told Bloomberg last month that he did not think enough members of Congress were on board for such a bill to get passed. Digital Chamber founder and CEO Perianne Boring told Reuters that she thought such a bill could pass, albeit not within the first 100 days. All in all, it seems that if national reserve legislation is approved by Congress, it won‚Äôt be anytime soon.¬†\n\nThe Political Calculus\n\nWith each of these bills, there‚Äôs political pressure on members of Congress to get something done before the midterm elections in 2026, according to Dave Grimaldi, executive vice president of government relations at Blockchain Association.¬†\n\nThe crypto industry‚Äôs donations to political campaigns had an outsized impact on electoral outcomes in November, and the industry‚Äôs largest Political Action Committee, Fairshake, has already raised millions for the midterms. Nobody who will be running for a competitive seat can afford to appear anti-crypto.¬†\n\n‚ÄúThe New Republican majority in the Senate and returning Republican majority in the House want to work with Democrats to make this an easy and quick process,‚Äù Grimaldi explained.¬†\n\nBefore the midterms, however, members of Congress don‚Äôt face any hard deadlines. It‚Äôs also safe to say that the Senate will be busy debating confirmations for controversial presidential political appointees over the first couple of months. Congress as a whole will be busy with Trump campaign priorities like border control and tax policy.¬†\n\nRead More: Who Will Be Trump‚Äôs CFTC Chair? There‚Äôs a New Top Contender for the Role\n\nAs CoinDesk‚Äôs Jesse Hamilton pointed out in the State of Crypto newsletter, it could take over a year for some of the changes articulated in crypto legislation to become reality.¬†\n\nIf the CFTC is given authority to oversee crypto in market structure legislation, for example, it could take months to design and implement a new set of rules, even if someone who has experience in the agency, like former commissioner Brian Quintenz or current commissioner Summer Mersinger, is chosen as chair. Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith told Unchained last month that the rulemaking process takes about 18 months.¬†\n\nAll of this means that when it comes to laws covering the crypto industry, change could take more than a year, if not several years, to become reality. And though that‚Äôs fast for government, it‚Äôs likely a pace the crypto markets will need some adjusting to.¬†\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nTrump Announces Team Working With AI & Crypto Czar\n\nWho Will Be Trump‚Äôs CFTC Chair?

The decision gives brokers more time to adapt their systems to the updated requirements.\n\nThe rules, introduced in July 2024, mandate taxpayers to specify which cryptocurrency units they are selling. If no method is identified, the default First In, First Out (FIFO) method will apply, which prioritizes selling the earliest acquired assets. Tax experts, such as Shehan Chandrasekera from CoinTracker, warn this could unintentionally increase capital gains for investors, as older assets often have a lower cost basis.\n\n‚ÄúThis delay avoids a scenario that could have been disastrous in the current bull market environment,‚Äù Chandrasekera explained on X.\n\nPhoto by Sean Lee on Unsplash\nSiqi Chen Faces Backlash Over Alleged Rug Pull With ‚ÄòZero‚Äô Token\n\nSiqi Chen, CEO of finance platform Runway and creator of the MIRA token, has come under fire for his actions involving a test token called ZERO. The controversy follows the launch of the MIRA token on Christmas day, created to support pediatric brain tumor research after Chen‚Äôs four-year-old daughter, Mira, was diagnosed with a rare brain tumor. MIRA gained widespread attention and significant backing from the crypto community, with Chen‚Äôs holdings in the token reportedly reaching $14 million.\n\nAmid the MIRA initiative, Chen launched ZERO on the Solana-based platform Pump.fun, describing it as a test token with the label: ‚ÄúThis coin will go to zero‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt buy it.‚Äù Despite the warning, investor interest quickly drove ZERO‚Äôs market cap to $6 million. Chen admitted to selling 40% of the supply, earning 444 SOL (approximately $90,000), which he claims to have used to buy back tokens before burning them.\n\n‚ÄúI take responsibility and [I] am committing to making every affected wallet whole out of my own personal funds,‚Äù Chen wrote on X. Critics, however, are skeptical, pointing to Chen‚Äôs repeated incidents involving similar tokens and questioning his claims of inexperience. The controversy has cast a shadow over his efforts with MIRA, despite its original philanthropic mission.\n\nTerraform Labs Co-Founder Do Kwon Extradited to the U.S.\n\nMontenegro has extradited Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon to the U.S., following months of legal proceedings and coordination with Interpol. Montenegro‚Äôs Ministry of Justice finalized the decision after rejecting Kwon‚Äôs appeal against extradition, citing the severity of his alleged crimes and the order of competing requests from South Korea and the U.S.\n\nKwon, who was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023 for traveling with forged documents, now faces criminal charges in the U.S., including conspiracy to commit fraud, money laundering, and electronic fraud. These charges stem from his involvement in the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin and Luna cryptocurrency, which caused billions in investor losses.\n\nThe extradition decision underscores the international collaboration involved in Kwon‚Äôs case, with Montenegro‚Äôs Special Police Unit and Interpol playing key roles in transferring him to U.S. custody. Kwon‚Äôs trial in the U.S. is expected to focus on the financial crimes linked to Terraform Labs.\n\nPhoto by Harry Shelton on Unsplash\nEthereum ETFs Close Out 2024 With $2.7 Billion Inflows\n\nEthereum ETFs ended 2024 with a remarkable $2.7 billion in net inflows, according to Farside Investors. The Fidelity Ethereum Fund led the market with $31.8 million in inflows on the final trading day, while the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust saw $9.8 million in additional investments.\n\nMeanwhile, Ethereum has achieved a significant milestone in holder behavior. Onchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock reported that 75% of ether holders are now long-term investors, compared to bitcoin‚Äôs 62%. This marks a notable shift, as bitcoin‚Äôs long-term holder percentage declined over the year, likely influenced by record profit-taking volumes reaching $2.1 billion daily.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\nCelsius Appeals Rejection of $444 Million Claim Against FTX\n\nCelsius Network, the bankrupt crypto lender, has filed an appeal challenging a court decision that disallowed its $444 million claim against bankrupt crypto exchange FTX. The appeal follows Judge John Dorsey‚Äôs December ruling, which dismissed Celsius‚Äô amended claims for failing to meet procedural requirements.\n\nInitially, Celsius sought $2 billion in damages, alleging that disparaging statements from FTX executives undermined confidence in its platform, hastening its collapse. The claim was later amended to focus on preferential transfers, demanding $444 million in repayments for funds allegedly given undue priority.\n\nPhoto by Mariia Shalabaieva on Unsplash\nWhale Activity Briefly Depegs USD0 Stablecoin\n\nOn Wednesday, the decentralized stablecoin Usual USD, also known as USD0, experienced a temporary depegging, trading at $0.99 following a substantial sell-off by a single whale in the secondary market. Despite the disruption, USD0 swiftly regained its $1 peg within hours.\n\n‚ÄúThis was our first major stress test of the USD0 peg, with more redemptions than the entire [total value locked] of GHO in a few hours ‚Äî yet it was business as usual,‚Äù the protocol‚Äôs team shared on X.\n\nUSD0 is fully backed by short-term, liquid, risk-free assets such as U.S. Treasury Bills and repurchase agreements to ensure robust collateralization.\n\nHYPE Token Staking Launches on HyperLiquid Mainnet\n\nThe Hyper Foundation has officially launched staking for its native token, HYPE, on the HyperLiquid decentralized exchange mainnet. Token holders can now delegate their HYPE to validators in exchange for staking rewards, a system designed to secure the network while rewarding community participation.\n\nAt launch, 357.6 million HYPE tokens, valued at approximately $9.4 billion, were staked, representing significant early adoption. The Hyper Foundation controlled 99.9% of the staked tokens through its validators, but this stake has since decreased to 88.8%, reflecting increased community participation.\n\n‚ÄúStaking is an important milestone for HyperLiquid because it allows the diverse community of HYPE stakers to collectively secure the network,‚Äù the foundation wrote on X. Plans for a delegation program to reward high-performing validators are underway, aiming to bolster network decentralization and security.\n\nTether Adds $700 Million in Bitcoin to Strategic Reserve\n\nTether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has transferred 7,629 bitcoin (worth approximately $700 million) to its strategic reserve, according to onchain data from Arkham Intelligence. The transfer, originating from Bitfinex's hot wallet, marks Tether's largest bitcoin allocation since March 2024.\n\nThis move brings Tether‚Äôs total bitcoin holdings to over 83,000 BTC, valued at more than $7.6 billion. Since May 2023, the company has allocated up to 15% of its net profits to bitcoin as part of its diversification strategy.\n\nTether‚Äôs reserves primarily comprise U.S. Treasury bonds and cash equivalents, but the company has been expanding its investments into bitcoin, AI, and decentralized communications, reflecting its broader ambitions in emerging sectors.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\nüòÇ FUN BITS: Swiss Bitcoiners Try to Make Their Central Bank a Bitcoin Whale\n\nMove over gold bars ‚Äî Swiss Bitcoin enthusiasts have a plan to make their central bank go full crypto. In a move as bold as it is bananas, they‚Äôre pushing to rewrite Switzerland‚Äôs constitution to force the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to add Bitcoin to its reserves.\n\n‚ÄúGold‚Äôs in the constitution, and Bitcoin is the best-performing asset of the last decade,‚Äù argued Yves Benna√Øm, the mastermind behind this plot and founder of Bitcoin non-profit 2B4CH.\n\nBecause why stop at world-class watches when you can have world-class hodling?\n\nThe group has 18 months to gather 100,000 signatures to kick-start the process. If they succeed, Switzerland might someday vote on whether their central bankers should start stacking sats.\n\nOf course, the SNB has been about as warm to Bitcoin as an Alpine glacier, citing the network's energy use and the volatility of its native token. But hey, if a constitutional change doesn‚Äôt convince them, maybe a ‚Äúlaser eyes‚Äù filter on their official portrait will!\n\nWatch the Recap!\n\nTo stay updated with everything that‚Äôs going on in crypto, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nSubscribe\n3 Likes\n3\nShare",

Young and Tikta\nAs Solana Rivalry Heats Up, Coinbase‚Äôs L2 Sets New Records for Addresses, Transactions\n\nBase has kicked off the new year achieving new milestones in onchain activity, strengthening its competitive position vis-√†-vis Solana.\n\nThe number of daily active addresses on Base climbed from under 70,000 in January last year to a new all-time high of three million on Wednesday, while the network‚Äôs daily transactions reached 13.4 million, representing an increase of around 3,521% from fewer than 375,000 transactions a year earlier, according to data from blockchain analytics firm Artemis.\n\nAI Meme Tokens Punch up in Potential 2025 Trend\n\nCrypto markets are already dashing doubts that the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies could end up being one of 2025‚Äôs most explosive investment narratives.\n\nTokens associated with AI tools and related memes are leading gains so far in the new year, advancing to record prices and market capitalizations.\n\nBlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF Sees Record $333M Outflow\n\nBlackRock‚Äôs U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund has seen its biggest-ever single-day exodus of funds.\n\nInvestors pulled $332.6 million from the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) on Jan. 2, according to data from investment management boutique Farside Investors.\n\nIBIT also saw more moderate outflows of $36.5 million and $23.5 million on 2024‚Äôs last two trading days.\n\nThe fund was one of the best performers among all spot ETF assets in the U.S. in 2024, ranking third in net inflows and seeing only 11 days of outflows during the year.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\nDo Kwon Pleads Not Guilty to U.S. Criminal Charges\n\nTerraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in the U.S., according to a report by Reuters.\n\nKwon appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Lehrburger in a Manhattan courtroom on Thursday, shortly after his extradition from Montenegro earlier this week. Kwon reportedly appeared to be in ‚Äúgood spirits.‚Äù\n\nFederal prosecutors also unsealed a nine-count indictment that charges Kwon with securities fraud, wire fraud, commodities fraud, and money laundering conspiracy related to the $40 billion in estimated losses from Terra‚Äôs collapse in 2022.\n\nKwon‚Äôs next court appearance is scheduled for Jan. 8.\n\nTether‚Äôs Market Cap Sinks $2B as MiCA Takes Effect\n\nUSDT‚Äôs market cap has dropped $2.1 billion in the last week, falling from $139.2 billion to $137.1 billion as the European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework came into force.\n\nThat slump was USDT‚Äôs biggest drop since the collapse of FTX in 2022.\n\nMiCA took effect on Dec. 30, ushering in a new era of crypto oversight in Europe that requires stablecoin issuers to obtain an e-money license and maintain up to two-thirds of reserves in independent banks. That makes Tether‚Äôs stablecoin, USDT, effectively illegal within the EU.\n\nSeparately, Tether and Bitfinex General Counsel Stuart Hoegner has retired, leaving Michael Hilliard, with whom Hoegner co-led Tether‚Äôs legal work, to take his place.\n\nPhoto by DrawKit Illustrations on Unsplash\nLens to Offer ICOs and ‚ÄòNew Flavour‚Äô of ERC-20s\n\nStani Kulechov, the founder of DeFi lender Aave and decentralized social media network Lens, has shared plans to release a new set of contracts on Lens.\n\nThe new features include initial coin offerings, a new ‚Äúflavour‚Äù of ERC-20 tokens, bonding curves, ERC-721 contracts and point systems.

Young and Tikta\n39 Ways to Lose Money in Crypto: How to Keep Your Money Safe\n\nFolks in the crypto ecosystem have witnessed an extraordinary level of wealth creation since Satoshi Nakamoto first introduced Bitcoin in 2009.\n\nJust this year, the overall market capitalization of digital assets has soared to $3.5 trillion, pretty much doubling from under $1.8 trillion at the start of the year. On the flip side, there‚Äôs no shortage of ways to lose money in crypto.\n\nIn 2024, crypto users suffered losses of around $1.5 billion, according to a report published by blockchain security firm Immunefi.\n\nInstead of providing examples of how people have pocketed money, Imunefi‚Äôs report goes straight for the safety-first approach ‚Äî or, rather the learn-from-the-mistakes-of-others strategy ‚Äî highlighting the countless ways in which people have seen funds disappear, never to return. Striving to be comprehensive, we have enumerated 39. There are probably way more.\n\nEthereum ETFs End 2024 With $2.7B in Net Inflows\n\nU.S. spot ether exchange-traded funds closed out the year with $2.7 billion of net inflows, according to data from investment management boutique Farside Investors.\n\nThe Fidelity Ethereum Fund recorded an impressive $31.8 million in net inflows on the last day of the trading year. The Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust saw a modest $9.8 million worth of inflows on the day.\n\nSome industry watchers believe that the recent inflows into Ethereum ETFs ‚Äî particularly in comparison to Bitcoin ETFs ‚Äî may indicate a shift in investor sentiment and could potentially set the stage for increased competition between the two cryptocurrencies this year.\n\nPhoto by Kanchanara on Unsplash\nUSD0 Briefly Depegs After Single Whale‚Äôs Trade\n\nThe Usual protocol saw a major sell-off of its decentralized stablecoin, USD0, triggered by a large whale transaction in the secondary market on Jan. 1.\n\nThe sell-off caused USD0 to trade briefly at $0.99, but it was able to fully recapitalise and regain its U.S. dollar peg within a few hours.\n\n‚ÄúOverall, this was our first major stress test of the USD0 peg, with more redemptions than the entire [total value locked] of GHO in a few hours ‚Äî yet it was business as Usual,‚Äù the protocol‚Äôs team said in a post on X.\n\nUSD0 is fully collateralized by short-term, liquid, risk-free assets ‚Äî mainly U.S. Treasury Bills and repurchase agreements. It is part of a broader ecosystem that includes USD0++, a liquid staking token, and $USUAL, the protocol's governance token.\n\nPump.fun Moves Over $55M SOL to Kraken\n\nSolana-based memecoin marketplace Pump.fun may be cashing out a significant amount of SOL.\n\nThe Pump.fun fee account moved $22.88 million of SOL to crypto exchange Kraken on Wednesday, according to data from blockchain analysis platform Arkham.\n\nThe fee account then moved another $32.7 million of SOL to Kraken through a new wallet address.\n\nPump.fun‚Äôs fee account currently holds around $23.3 million of SOL and $13.1 million of liquid staking token JitoSOL.\n\nDeSci Sees 2,640% Mindshare Uptick in 2024\n\nNarratives change quickly in the crypto space, but none grew as fast in 2024 as decentralized science, or DeSci, protocols.\n\nDeSci has seen a 2,640% increase in mindshare since January 2024, according to data shared by Sandra Leow, a research partner at Web3 information platform Kaito.\n\nThe second-biggest increase was observed in trusted execution environments, which saw a 192% uptick over the year.\n\nArtificial intelligence, chain abstraction, stablecoins, and Solana virtual machines are also seeing increased interest, but the narrative around layer 2 networks, liquid restaking tokens, and the BRC-20 token standard has less buzz than it used to.\n\n2024 Was Full of Fascinating Crypto News. Here Are Its Top Moments\n\nFrom the groundbreaking success of the ETFs to Solana‚Äôs dominance and the Trump effect on Bitcoin, we look back at the stories and voices that defined 2024.\n\n2024 was nothing short of transformative for the crypto world. From bitcoin‚Äôs relentless climb amidst macroeconomic shifts to Solana‚Äôs continued rise amidst meme coin mania, this year saw narratives unfold that no one could have predicted.\n\nIn this special episode that has become a tradition at Unchained, Laura revisits the biggest moments of the year, featuring insightful clips from the standout guests who joined Unchained and Bits + Bips in 2024.\n\nWhether it was further institutional adoption, debates over decentralization, the victory over Gary Genser‚Äôs regulation by enforcement strategy, or the taking off of AI agents, this year marked a turning point for crypto. Tune in for a reflective journey through the year that was‚Äîand a glimpse of what lies ahead in 2025.\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

I‚Äôm Tikta, a reporter at Unchained. Bring on the new year!\n\nIn today‚Äôs edition:\n\nü§® MIRA dad faces doubts\n\nüí∞ HYPE rolls out staking\n\nüí∏ High-profile hacker returns to haunt us\n\n‚õΩ Tether‚Äôs bitcoin top-up\n\nEarn 20%+ APR on ETH with High Growth Vault by Kelp\n\nHigh Gain is your tokenized solution for generating the highest rewards on ETH in 1 click‚Äì while keeping you liquid with hgETH.\n\nDeposit Now!\n\nWhat‚Äôs Poppin‚Äô?\nBy Tikta\nMIRA‚Äôs Siqi Chen Apologizes for ‚ÄòPanic Selling‚Äô Own Token\n\nTech CEO Siqi Chen helped to raise millions of dollars on Christmas Day for his four-year-old daughter, Mira, whose diagnosis with a rare type of brain tumor inspired the creation of an eponymous Solana memecoin. Now, just a few days later, Chen has claimed that he inadvertently orchestrated a rug pull in a token he created named ZERO.\n\n‚Äúi [sic] am so sorry i [sic] messed this up so badly on behalf of the $MIRA and Solana communities,‚Äù he wrote on X, vowing to make users whole with his personal funds. ‚Äúi [sic] am committed to making sure mine and $MIRA‚Äôs integrity and mission is upheld.‚Äù\n\nChen said he created ZERO as a test token on Pump.fun, marking it with the description ‚Äúthis is going to zero ‚Ä¶ do not buy it,‚Äù and later said he ‚Äúpanic‚Äù sold 40% of the supply, netting himself around 444 SOL ($83,470).\n\nHe then claimed to have spent the full amount buying back in, ‚Äúthen burned everything i [sic] have so the community knows at least that i [sic] have made zero in profits from this.‚Äù\n\nAlthough he said he is ‚Äústill learning how this all works,‚Äù members of the crypto community aren‚Äôt necessarily convinced by his mea culpa. Two days ago, Chen claimed a ‚Äúmisclick‚Äù after buying 15% of Solana memecoin ChAIrity and exiting with a $60,000 profit after roughly 10 minutes.\n\nPseudonymous decentralized finance analyst The DeFi Edge noted that Chen‚Äôs claims to be a crypto newcomer don‚Äôt quite check out, based on tweets he posted years ago.\n\n‚ÄúIt actually makes me sad to see this guy using his sick daughter for $ while larping as a crypto noob. He's been around for many years now participating in the scene,‚Äù another user wrote on X.\n\nHYPE Token Staking Goes Live on Mainnet\n\nThe Hype Foundation, the entity behind decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, has announced that staking of HYPE tokens is now live on its mainnet.\n\nUsers can stake HYPE to validators in exchange for earnings token rewards. The Hype Foundation said it will support high-performing validators through a delegation program, with more information to be announced in due course.\n\nStaking went live with 16 genesis validators, and Hype Foundation validators had a stake of 99.9% of the total HYPE staked at launch. The foundation‚Äôs stake has since dropped to 88.8%.\n\nAt the time of writing, a total of 357.6 million HYPE tokens had been staked, representing a value of $9.4 billion.\n\nBlockchain Bandit Moves $172M ETH After 2 Years\n\nInfamous online thief Blockchain Bandit has resurfaced after two years, moving 51,000 ETH worth around $172 million to a new multi-signature wallet.\n\nThe transfers were flagged by pseudonymous blockchain sleuth ZachXBT, who noted in a Telegram post that the funds had been moved in batches of 5,000 ETH on Dec. 30 between 8:54 p.m. UTC and 9:18 p.m. UTC.\n\nThe return of Blockchain Bandit has raised fears that the consolidated ETH could be used to fund further exploits.\n\nThe hacker originally stole funds between 2015 and 2018 through a method known as \"ethercombing,\" which involved using software to guess weak passwords and access private keys. Using that technique, the hacker successfully guessed 732 private keys and drained more than 10,000 cryptocurrency wallets.\n\nTether Shifts $776M Bitcoin to Reserve\n\nTether, the company behind the USDT stablecoin, has made a significant addition to its Bitcoin reserves.\n\nTether transferred 7,629 BTC, valued at approximately $705 million, from Bitfinex's hot wallet to its strategic Bitcoin reserve address on Dec. 30. Around two hours later, it transferred another 775 BTC to the reserve address.\n\nThe latest addition to Tether‚Äôs reserve, its largest in nine months, takes the stablecoin issuer‚Äôs total BTC holdings to 83,759 BTC.\n\nIn May 2023, Tether said it planned to allocate up to 15% of its net realised operating profits to bitcoin.\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

Almost there for 2024! I‚Äôm Tikta, a reporter at Unchained.\n\nIn today‚Äôs edition:\n\nüîé DeFi disclosures loom\n\nü™ù Do Kwon gets reeled in\n\nüè¶ ETH HODLers increase\n\nü§® Squid game‚Äôs fishy tokens\n\nEarn 20%+ APR on ETH with High Growth Vault by Kelp\n\nHigh Gain is your tokenized solution for generating the highest rewards on ETH in 1 click‚Äì while keeping you liquid with hgETH.\n\nDeposit Now!\n\nWhat‚Äôs Poppin‚Äô?\nBy Tikta\nIRS Finalizes Controversial DeFi Broker Rule\n\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service has finalized a tax rule that would require certain decentralized finance brokers to collect and report on user activity.\n\nThe new regulation, set to take effect in 2027, calls for front-end DeFi protocols to file Forms 1099, ‚ÄúDigital Asset Proceeds from Broker Transactions,‚Äù and report information such as transaction IDs and wallet addresses.\n\n‚ÄúThis rule has been ready to go for a while now,‚Äù Consensys‚Äô legal counsel, Bill Hughes, said in a post on X. ‚ÄúThey dump it [on] the last Friday of 2024 in the middle of a holiday stretch on purpose, obviously. As if we wouldn‚Äôt notice or make an absolute ruckus over it.‚Äù\n\nCrypto lobbying groups such as the Blockchain Association, the DeFi Education Fund and the Texas Blockchain Council have filed a joint lawsuit against the IRS and the Treasury Department‚Äôs ‚Äúmidnight rulemaking.‚Äù\n\nDo Kwon U.S. Extradition Order Gets a Green Light\n\nMontenegro‚Äôs minister of justice, Bojan Bo≈æoviƒá, has signed an order allowing the extradition of Terra co-founder Do Kwon to the U.S.\n\nThe decision comes after the Supreme Court of Montenegro previously ruled that Kwon should be extradited to the U.S. after much back and forth over whether he should be extradited to his native South Korea instead.\n\nAssessment criteria included the severity of Kwon‚Äôs criminal offenses, where his crimes were committed, and the order in which the U.S. and South Korea had submitted extradition requests.\n\nIndustry watchers believe that Kwon will likely face a harsher sentence in the U.S. than in South Korea, based on the way the American justice system prosecutes financial crimes.\n\nPhoto by niu niu on Unsplash\nLong-Term ETH Holders Overtook Bitcoiners in 2024\n\nThe proportion of long-term ether holders has increased to 75% over the past year, while the proportion of long-term bitcoin holders has dropped to 62%, according to data from onchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock.\n\nBitcoin‚Äôs stellar performance in 2024 and ether‚Äôs relatively lacklustre year may have something to do with holders‚Äô behaviour.\n\nEarlier this month, blockchain data firm Glassnode noted that long-term bitcoin holders took profits of $2.1 billion daily, a new all-time high volume.\n\nEthereum holders, conversely, might be holding out for higher ETH prices before cashing out.\n\nSquid Game Scam Tokens Reappear as New Series Airs\n\nFraudulent crypto tokens based on the ‚ÄúSquid Game‚Äù Netflix series have once again found their way into the crypto market as the show goes to air for a second season.\n\nBlockchain security firm PeckShield warned users about one such token deployed on Base that plummeted in value.\n\nData and analysis platform DEX Screener show that there are still several more tokens with the same name trading on decentralized exchanges.\n\nIn 2021, a group of unknown developers created a token called SQUID, marketing it as a \"play-to-earn\" opportunity inspired by the show.\n\nPhoto by Daniel Bernard on Unsplash\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

At one point, the value of his holdings was worth more than $18 million. After garnering support from the crypto community in X polls, Siqi liquidated a small portion of his holdings.\n\nIn an update posted on X, he said he plans to donate 100% of all proceeds directly to fund rare disease research.\n\n‚ÄúStarting in about 12 hours, I will be liquidating $1,000 worth of MIRA every 10 minutes, perpetually. No more and no less than that. If I change this schedule, I commit to announcing it 24 hours in advance,‚Äù Chen said.\n\n‚ÄúIf you want to rug it to $0, go for it ‚Äî at the end of the day we set out to raise $200K and we will end up with at least $1M towards rare disease research.‚Äù\n\nAt the time of writing, MIRA had a market cap of around $23 million and 16,300 holders, according to data from decentralized exchange tracker GeckoTerminal.\n\nBitwise Applies to Launch Bitcoin ETF\n\nCrypto index fund manager Bitwise has submitted an application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a new exchange-traded fund.\n\nAccording to a Dec. 26 filing, its Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF would provide exposure to shares of companies with at least $100 million in market cap that adopt the Bitcoin standard and hold at least 1,000 BTC among their financial assets.\n\nBitwise‚Äôs fund would assign a weight to those companies based on the market value of their Bitcoin treasuries rather than their individual market capitalizations. Firms with more BTC on their balance sheets would be assigned a greater weight.\n\nMore than 20 companies are expected to be eligible for inclusion in the proposed ETF.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy‚Äôs Strive Files for Bitcoin Bond ETF\n\nStrive Asset Management, a self-styled ‚Äúanti-woke‚Äù and ‚Äúanti-ESG‚Äù investment firm founded by rightwing entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, has filed an application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a Bitcoin bond ETF.\n\nThe proposed Strive Bitcoin Bond ETF would aim to provide exposure to Bitcoin bonds ‚Äî convertible securities issued by companies such as MicroStrategy that use the proceeds of their offerings to purchase Bitcoin.\n\nThe ETF would be actively managed, investing directly in those bonds and using financial products such as swaps and options.\n\nThe fund would target convertible bonds issued by companies that have invested significant portions of their capital in Bitcoin.\n\nAnimoca Brands Founder‚Äôs X Account Hacked to Promote Fake Token\n\nAnimoca Brands co-founder and Chair Yat Siu‚Äôs X account has been compromised in a cyberattack.\n\nHackers took control of his account to promote a fake token dubbed Animoca Brands (MOCA) on the Solana blockchain.\n\nAnimoca Brands responded quickly to the incident, confirming the hack and warning users that the company was not introducing an official token or NFT.\n\nThe hack is part of a broader phishing scam targeting crypto-related X accounts that has reportedly stolen around $500,000 in the past month.\n\nPhoto by Adrien on Unsplash\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

No vulnerabilities have been shared by any party.‚Äù\n\nMetaMask developer Taylor Monahan was among those warning that the crypto trading platform faced an elevated risk of being targeted by North Korean hackers.\n\n‚ÄúSomeone claiming to be a security party previously attempted to reach out to Labs,‚Äù the Hyperliquid team said. ‚ÄúTo be clear, there was never any allegation of any exploit on Hyperliquid.\n\n‚ÄúThis party added a scam account to a group chat and later communicated with insults and profanity,‚Äù the team said. ‚ÄúGiven the level of professionalism displayed, Labs conferred instead with trusted parties and confirmed it is following best practices.‚Äù\n\nPhoto by Pankaj Patel on Unsplash\nBitcoin ETFs See $1.3B of Outflows in Four Days\n\nU.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds have clocked up their longest streak of outflows since the days leading up to the election of Donald Trump as America‚Äôs next president.\n\nThe 12 spot bitcoin ETFs listed in the U.S. recorded $1.3 billion of outflows over the four most recent trading days, according to data from investment management firm Farside Investors.\n\nThe outflows coincide with a downward turn for bitcoin, which lost support above the $100,000 mark last week.\n\nAfter falling to a low of $92,400 on Dec. 20, bitcoin has since regained momentum and is currently trading at around $98,000.\n\nMt. Gox Transfers $364M to OTC Market Maker B2C2\n\nBankrupt Japanese crypto exchange Mt. Gox has been among those making the most of bitcoin‚Äôs rally past $100,000 in mid-December.\n\nThe exchange has been sending installments of 200 BTC to 300 BTC to over-the-counter market maker B2C2 Group every weekday since bitcoin breached the historic milestone on Dec. 5, onchain wallet tracker Lookonchain found.\n\nIn total, Mt. Gox has transferred a total of $364 million to B2C2 Group.\n\nWallets belonging to Mt. Gox identified by blockchain analytics platform Arkham indicate that the exchange still holds $3.5 billion worth of bitcoin.\n\nMt. Gox began repaying its creditors after a decade-long bankruptcy process earlier this year.\n\nAs of July, the exchange had paid back 41.5% of the 142,000 BTC that it is set to distribute to creditors.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\n\nDeFi‚Äôs Top Two Protocols Exceed $75B in Net Deposits\n\nDecentralized lending protocol Aave and staking protocol Lido surpassed the $75 billion net deposit mark for the first time this month, according to data from analytics platform Token Terminal.\n\nNet deposits ‚Äî distinct from total value locked (TVL) ‚Äî are the total sum deposited into a DeFi protocol, excluding transaction fees and synthetic tokens.\n\nAave currently has around $34 billion in net deposits, while Lido has $33 billion. Together, the two account for 40% of the $166 billion deposited in DeFi protocols.\n\nThe uptick in deposits comes amid a broader resurgence in the DeFi market, whose TVL has more than doubled this year.\n\n2024 Was Solana‚Äôs Best Year Yet. Can It Sustain the Momentum in 2025?\n\nThis year has been a transformative one for Solana. With a surge in developer activity, bold innovations in DePIN, and its ambitions to become a ‚Äúdecentralized Nasdaq,‚Äù the ecosystem is making waves. But are these changes enough to differentiate it from competitors like Ethereum and L2 solutions such as Base?\n\nIn this episode of Unchained‚Äôs podcast series, Lily Liu, president of the Solana Foundation, and Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius, join our founder and CEO Laura Shin to discuss how Solana is carving out its niche. They debate whether Base is a serious contender, why they‚Äôre not concerned about the 2025 token unlocks, and how Solana‚Äôs unique approach to MEV could shape its future. Plus, they tackle the ecosystem‚Äôs broader challenges and why they believe Solana‚Äôs vision will endure.\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

The proposal also calls for setting up cross-chain bridge infrastructure and allocating an additional 1% of funds from ecological incentives to establish a cross-chain liquidity pool.\n\nüá∑üá∫ Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov says the country has been using digital assets such as bitcoin in foreign trade, a tactic that has allowed Moscow to get around Western sanctions imposed in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022.\n\nToday in Crypto Adoption...\n\nü™ô Six mutual funds tracking bitcoin will begin trading in Israel after the country‚Äôs finance sector regulator granted final approval for the products last week.\n\nüëè South Korea's cryptocurrency user base reached 15.6 million in November, equivalent to more than 30% of the country's population.\n\nWhat Do You Meme?\nüìà Your Market Update üìâ\n\nBTC is up 0.6%, trading at $95,771\n\nETH is up 0.4%, trading at $3,376\n\nBTC dominance: 54.5%\n\nCrypto market cap: $3.47T\n\n*All data as of today, 06:40 am ET.

No vulnerabilities have been shared by any party.‚Äù\n\nMetaMask developer Taylor Monahan was among those warning that the crypto trading platform faced an elevated risk of being targeted by North Korean hackers.\n\n‚ÄúSomeone claiming to be a security party previously attempted to reach out to Labs,‚Äù the Hyperliquid team said. ‚ÄúTo be clear, there was never any allegation of any exploit on Hyperliquid.\n\n‚ÄúThis party added a scam account to a group chat and later communicated with insults and profanity,‚Äù the team said. ‚ÄúGiven the level of professionalism displayed, Labs conferred instead with trusted parties and confirmed it is following best practices.‚Äù\n\nPhoto by Pankaj Patel on Unsplash\nBitcoin ETFs See $1.3B of Outflows in Four Days\n\nU.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds have clocked up their longest streak of outflows since the days leading up to the election of Donald Trump as America‚Äôs next president.\n\nThe 12 spot bitcoin ETFs listed in the U.S. recorded $1.3 billion of outflows over the four most recent trading days, according to data from investment management firm Farside Investors.\n\nThe outflows coincide with a downward turn for bitcoin, which lost support above the $100,000 mark last week.\n\nAfter falling to a low of $92,400 on Dec. 20, bitcoin has since regained momentum and is currently trading at around $98,000.\n\nMt.

Gox has transferred a total of $364 million to B2C2 Group.\n\nWallets belonging to Mt. Gox identified by blockchain analytics platform Arkham indicate that the exchange still holds $3.5 billion worth of bitcoin.\n\nMt. Gox began repaying its creditors after a decade-long bankruptcy process earlier this year.\n\nAs of July, the exchange had paid back 41.5% of the 142,000 BTC that it is set to distribute to creditors.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\n\nDeFi‚Äôs Top Two Protocols Exceed $75B in Net Deposits\n\nDecentralized lending protocol Aave and staking protocol Lido surpassed the $75 billion net deposit mark for the first time this month, according to data from analytics platform Token Terminal.\n\nNet deposits ‚Äî distinct from total value locked (TVL) ‚Äî are the total sum deposited into a DeFi protocol, excluding transaction fees and synthetic tokens.\n\nAave currently has around $34 billion in net deposits, while Lido has $33 billion. Together, the two account for 40% of the $166 billion deposited in DeFi protocols.\n\nThe uptick in deposits comes amid a broader resurgence in the DeFi market, whose TVL has more than doubled this year.\n\n2024 Was Solana‚Äôs Best Year Yet.

With a surge in developer activity, bold innovations in DePIN, and its ambitions to become a ‚Äúdecentralized Nasdaq,‚Äù the ecosystem is making waves. But are these changes enough to differentiate it from competitors like Ethereum and L2 solutions such as Base?\n\nIn this episode of Unchained‚Äôs podcast series, Lily Liu, president of the Solana Foundation, and Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius, join our founder and CEO Laura Shin to discuss how Solana is carving out its niche. They debate whether Base is a serious contender, why they‚Äôre not concerned about the 2025 token unlocks, and how Solana‚Äôs unique approach to MEV could shape its future. Plus, they tackle the ecosystem‚Äôs broader challenges and why they believe Solana‚Äôs vision will endure.\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

    "content": "Discover more from Unchained\nYour no-hype resource for all things crypto\nOver 17,000 subscribers\nBy subscribing, I agree to Substack's Terms of Use, and acknowledge its Information Collection Notice and Privacy Policy.\nSubscribe\nContinue reading\nSign in\nTRADGOV (PREVIOUSLY UNREGULATED)\nWho Will Be on the Crypto Council? üá∫üá∏\nWith each new announcement comes more questions.\nVERONICA IRWIN\nDEC 24, 2024\n1\nShare\n\nHey! I‚Äôm Veronica Irwin, Unchained‚Äôs regulatory reporter.\n\nI still have a lot of questions about the role of AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks. How active will he be in hashing out the details of crypto policy? Will he be visiting the Capitol to intervene in legislation like Elon Musk did to weigh in on the continuing resolution bill (you know, that budget bill that keeps the government from shutting down) last week? Who in the industry, if anyone, will he listen to?¬†\n\nWe still don‚Äôt have all the answers ‚Äî but we are starting to get more details. A lengthy (by Truth Social standards) announcement from President-elect Donald Trump Sunday night started to flesh out the job description, while introducing the crypto industry to some of the people who will work with him on guiding crypto policy. A conversation I had with a congressman last week provided some more detail.¬†\n\nTrump Announces Team Working With AI & Crypto Czar: What We Know\nHines was chosen to lead the Crypto Council. (Associated Press)\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump named appointees for several White House advisory roles on Sunday, each of whom he said will work with the future AI & Crypto Czar David Sacks to lead the new administration‚Äôs technology policy. The roles, some of which existed prior to his election and some of which will be new, are mostly filled by Trump loyalists rather than well-known names in technology policy circles.¬†\n\nBo Hines will serve as executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets (abbreviated in the post as the ‚ÄúCrypto Council‚Äù)Trump did not name the members of council but described them as ‚Äúluminaries from the Crypto industry.‚Äù¬†\n\n‚ÄúIn his new role, Bo will work with David to foster innovation and growth in the digital assets space, while ensuring industry leaders have the resources they need to succeed,‚Äù Trump explained in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social. ‚ÄúTogether, they will create an environment where this industry can flourish, and remain a cornerstone of our Nation‚Äôs technological advancement.‚Äù\n\nRead More: David Sacks as A.I. & Crypto Czar? Why the Industry Was Surprised\n\nThe announcement, which stretched across two Truth Social posts, included the appointment of Sriram Krishnan as senior policy advisor for artificial intelligence, a new role at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Michael J.K. Kratsios will be director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and Lynne Parker was named to be executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology (PCAST), two offices which predate the Trump administration.\n\nThe announcements Sunday provide more details to the role of David Sacks, who has met with some members of the House of Representatives and has had a one-on-one meeting with French Hill, a representative from Arkansas and designated to be the next session‚Äôs Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, according to sources directly familiar with the matter. One representative who met with Sacks said he was thoroughly impressed with his detailed understanding of crypto and was under the impression that Sacks would be involved in the details of crypto regulation. According to the representative, Sacks used the meeting to explain his stance on the ‚Äúvalue proposition‚Äù of Bitcoin. First, Sacks explained that Bitcoin is valuable because of its limited, algorithmically-controlled supply, according to the representative. Second, Sacks said that Bitcoin is valuable because it is not backed by any government and is not fiat ‚Äî an explanation which sounds similar to that which could be made for an asset like gold.¬†\n\nHines ran against Wiley Nickel, a Democratic representative for North Carolina, in 2022, losing narrowly in a competitive swing state with 48.4% of the vote, according to Ballotpedia. Prior to politics Hines played college football as a wide receiver for North Carolina State and Yale. He received a law degree from Wake Forest University in 2022, and is 29 years old.¬†\n\nRead More: Who Will Be Trump's CFTC Chair? There's a New Top Contender for the Role\n\nTwo sources who spoke with Unchained conceded that Hines was not well-known in crypto policy circles but has been an outspoken Trump loyalist throughout his political career. One of them pointed out that Hines had the clean cut, preppy appearance and Ivy League pedigree Trump, who is reportedly concerned with how his cabinet looks on television, seems to prefer in his appointments.\n\nBlockchain Association Head of Industry Affairs Dan Spuller posted on X that Hines had visited the association‚Äôs headquarters earlier this year and called Hines a ‚Äúfriend.‚Äù Spuller told Unchained that Hines met with the Blockchain Association as a candidate for Congress in the primary this year, and that he did not know that he was being considered for a role on the Crypto Council. As we first reported in November, crypto advisory groups were consulted about the nomination of Paul Atkins for SEC Chair, though sources have not said these groups have been consulted for other roles relevant to crypto.¬†\n\nHines‚Äô social media shows strong support of crypto, though his posts on the topic pale in comparison to posts in support of Donald Trump‚Äôs presidential campaign in recent months. A page on his Congressional campaign website also positions DeFi as core to Hines‚Äô economic agenda. ‚ÄúInstead of restrictive measures, advocating for a pro-crypto stance fosters a vibrant ecosystem, driving socio-economic empowerment,‚Äù it reads. ‚ÄúFurthermore, the U.S. should adamantly resist the adoption of central bank digital currencies, preserving financial sovereignty and the principles of decentralization.‚Äù¬†\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nCrypto-Savvy Rep.

Will he return the favor?\nVERONICA IRWIN\nDEC 23, 2024\n2\nShare\n\nHey! I‚Äôm Veronica Irwin, Unchained‚Äôs regulatory reporter.\n\nThe congressman crypto worked hardest to elect will serve on the Senate Banking Committee next year ‚Äî the same committee the man he unseated, Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown, currently leads. It‚Äôs kind of poetic, really.\n\nHe won‚Äôt have much power as a brand-new congressman but it‚Äôs definitely not nothing. Having crypto advocates on a committee key to passing crypto legislation is very useful. Maybe he can balance oout a little bit of the skepticism that will inevitably come from Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, too.\n\nOhio Republican Senator Bernie Moreno to Serve on Influential Senate Banking Committee\nMoreno previously founded a blockchain-related company and was once a member of blockchain policy group The Digital Chamber before pivoting to politics.\n\nNewly elected Ohio Republican Senator Bernie Moreno will serve on the Senate Banking Committee, a group that is responsible for overseeing the SEC and plays a key role in developing crypto legislation. Moreno received over $40 million from crypto-focused political action committees (PACs) to defeat incumbent Ohio Democratic Senator and crypto critic Sherrod Brown.\n\nBrown had deeply frustrated the industry by refusing to prioritize crypto legislation as Chair of the Senate Banking Committee, thereby stalling the passage of bills having to do with market structure and stablecoins. Brown had also supported Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren in holding hearings on how terrorist organizations were utilizing crypto and consistently calling on X for regulators to rein in the industry.\n\n‚ÄúIn an ironic twist, the anti-crypto Sen. Brown not only lost his Senate seat to pro-crypto Sen. Moreno, but now his seat on the Senate Banking Committee. Moreno joins a strong lineup of other pro-crypto Senators and brings the unique expertise of having actually ran a blockchain company. His deep knowledge of crypto and operating a business in the US will be a well added addition to the Senate Banking Committee,‚Äù said Ron Hammond, Director of Government Relations at The Blockchain Association.\n\nRead more: Elizabeth Warren Will Be the Top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee\n\nAs a member of the Senate Banking Committee, Moreno will be in a position to weigh in on the details of legislation related to US economic policies, including those relating to crypto market structure, stablecoins, and the potential creation of a national bitcoin reserve. Several members of Congress have pledged to prioritize legislation on these topics next year. However, it is South Carolina Republican Senator Tim Scott, who is also outspokenly pro crypto but didn‚Äôt receive the same financial support from the industry as Moreno, who will chair the committee and decide which bills it prioritizes.\n\nMoreno‚Äôs Crypto Background\n\nIn 2018, Moreno founded the company Ownum, which sells technology to put car titles on the blockchain, and was once a member of blockchain policy group The Digital Chamber before pursuing politics. Though Moreno did not listcrypto among his 16 core ‚Äúpolicy priorities‚Äù on his campaign website, he did post multiple statements of support for the industry on X and spoke outagainst a harsh regulatory environment on the campaign trail in the months leading up to the election, solidifying a reputation for being a strong crypto advocate.\n\n‚ÄúOur Founding Fathers would have been bitcoiners,‚Äù he told Bitcoin Magazine in June. ‚ÄúThey believed in the decentralization of power.‚Äù\n\nRead More: Stand With Crypto Says These Races are Crucial for Crypto. But Why?\n\nMoreno‚Äôs support for the industry attracted millions of dollars in campaign support from crypto business leaders and PACs. The Fairshake PAC, for example, gave over $40 million to Moreno‚Äôs campaign, which was primarily used to fund ads that did not focus on crypto but instead on Moreno‚Äôs investments in small businesses, as well as warning about the threat of immigrants and China.\n\nMoreno‚Äôs win has been somewhat controversial post-election due to the fact that unseating Sherrod Brown made the even more anti-crypto Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren the senior member of the now-minority Democratic party on the committee. This means that if Democrats take back the Senate in two years, Warren would be the Chair of the Senate Banking Committee and in a position to block crypto legislation or initiate the markups of bills that could restrict the industry.\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nCrypto-Savvy Rep.

Their combined holdings are currently worth more than $330 billion.\n\nPhoto by Shutter Speed on Unsplash\nU.S. Bitcoin Reserve Could Offset $42T of National Debt, VanEck Says\n\nAsset manager VanEck estimates that if the U.S. government follows the trajectory of large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions proposed by the Bitcoin Act, introduced in the Senate earlier this year, the implications for countering inflation and lowering government debt could be significant.\n\n‚ÄúThe reserve could represent an estimated 35% of the national debt by 2049, offsetting ~$42 trillion of liabilities,‚Äù said VanEck‚Äôs head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, and investment analyst Nathan Frankovitz in a Dec. 20 report.\n\nDescribing that scenario as ‚Äúoptimistic,‚Äù Sigel and Frankovitz said it assumed that U.S. debt would compound at a rate of 5% from a base of $37 trillion during the period 2025 to 2049, and that Bitcoin would compound at a rate of 25% annually from a starting value of $200,000.\n\nU.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced the Bitcoin Act of 2024 in July. If passed, the legislation will authorize the U.S. Treasury to acquire 1 million BTC over a five-year period, representing approximately 5% of the total bitcoin supply.\n\nThe purchasing program would be funded by diversifying existing funds within the Federal Reserve System and Treasury Department, including by using Federal Reserve remittances.\n\nJump Crypto Subsidiary Fined $123M for Propping up UST During Depeg\n\nTai Mo Shan, a subsidiary of Jump Trading's crypto unit Jump Crypto, has agreed to pay $123 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charges that it misled investors about the stability of the TerraUSD (UST) algorithmic stablecoin and violated securities regulations related to Terra‚Äôs native token, LUNA.\n\nAccording to the SEC, the two firms entered into an agreement that incentivized Tai Mo Shan to purchase LUNA at a discount to its market price. In the days that followed, UST lost its peg to the U.S. dollar, and Tai Mo Shan attempted to restore the peg by purchasing more than $20 million of UST, a move that the SEC said deceived the market into believing that UST issuer Terraform‚Äôs algorithmic mechanism was working to stabilize UST, when in reality the price was being stabilized, at least in part, by Tai Mo Shan‚Äôs large UST purchases.\n\nTai Mo Shan has agreed to pay $73.4 million in disgorgement, $12.9 million in prejudgment interest, and a $36.7 million civil penalty.\n\nLearn more: What Is Terra and Why Did It Fail?\n\nSecuritize Proposes BlackRock‚Äôs BUIDL as Onchain Collateral for Frax\n\nSecuritize Markets, the firm that tokenized BlackRock‚Äôs U.S. Dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), has proposed that the fund be added as a reserve asset for Frax Finance's frxUSD stablecoin, a relaunch of Frax USD.\n\nIn a proposal posted to Frax‚Äôs governance forum, Securitize said the use of BUIDL as a reserve asset could significantly reduce counterparty risk, in addition to providing better liquidity and yield generating options.\n\nBUIDL currently manages more than $549 million in assets, mainly short-term U.S. Treasuries, according to data from real-world asset tokenization analytics firm RWZ.xyz.\n\nInitial feedback on the proposal has been generally positive.

I‚Äôm Veronica Irwin, Unchained‚Äôs regulatory reporter.\n\nThe crypto industry is ringing in 2025 with a lot more excitement than a year ago. At least, the members of the Blockchain Association are.¬†\n\nThe mood at this week‚Äôs Blockchain Association Policy Summit in Washington, DC was cautiously optimistic, as the policy organization‚Äôs member companies and pro-crypto politicians discussed how to maximize crypto‚Äôs wins in the November elections and establish regulatory clarity. While mainstage talks (and boozy after-hours dinners and parties) were largely celebratory in tone, sideline meetings and working groups focused on hashing out points of disagreement between crypto companies to make sure the industry didn‚Äôt fumble a chance to pass favorable legislation.\n\nAs Kristin Smith, the association‚Äôs executive director, explained to me on Tuesday, electing pro-crypto politicians to Congress and the presidency was only half the battle. Now, the industry needs to get organized so it can deliver a cohesive and clear message to Washington on how it wants them to ‚Äúget policy done.‚Äù¬†\n\nSince the speeches given at the event are going to be posted online, I decided to cover the summit through a series of short interviews with key industry players about what they're spending their energy on as the year comes to a close. Enjoy!¬†\n\nP.S. I‚Äôd love to hear about what you‚Äôre looking forward to (or watching out for) in crypto policy next year. Drop me a line at veronica@unchainedcrypto.com¬†\n\nFormer CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo explains how Trump could reset U.S. crypto policy, why he supports Brian Quintenz for CFTC chair, and whether he thinks the U.S. will launch a CBDC.\nDave Grimaldi, EVP of the Blockchain Association, explains how Democrats‚Äô attitudes toward crypto are shifting post-election, the rise of the crypto voter, and why stablecoin legislation might arrive sooner than market structure reform.\nAt the Blockchain Association Policy Summit in DC, BA CEO Kristin Smith explains what a pro-crypto Congress and president mean for the industry and what could bring builders back to the U.S.\nMarta Belcher, president of the Filecoin Foundation, shares her insights on the likelihood of passing FIT21, stablecoin legislation, and what‚Äôs next for crypto policy.\nAmanda Tuminelli, chief legal officer at the DeFi Education Fund, unpacks the implications of Section 1960 and the Tornado Cash case, highlighting how evolving interpretations of money transmission laws could criminalize developers.\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nCrypto-Savvy Rep.

CEO Vlad Tenev shares his vision for how to marry TradFi and crypto, and what role stablecoins, staking, and prediction markets will play.\n\nIn this episode of Unchained, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev offers a rare glimpse into the company‚Äôs strategy. How did memes like Dogecoin become one of Robinhood‚Äôs biggest assets, onboarding millions of users? What drove its decision to embrace stablecoins, staking, and a dedicated crypto wallet‚Äîand what risks do these moves carry?\n\nAs Europe‚Äôs MiCA regulations set the stage for a global crypto framework, Vlad discusses how Robinhood is positioning itself for growth, the role of prediction markets, and why blockchain could dramatically lower costs for investors. He also shares personal insights from his own experiences with hyperinflation, revealing how stablecoins might safeguard wealth for millions around the world.\n\nWith crypto ETFs, regulatory shifts, and a new administration looming, here‚Äôs what he thinks is next for Robinhood‚Äîand the crypto industry.\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nWeekly News Recap\nAave and Polygon Clash as Yield Proposal Sparks Tensions\n\nA brewing rivalry between OG protocols Aave and Polygon took center stage this week after Polygon introduced a governance proposal to allocate $1.3 billion in bridged stablecoins into Morpho, a competing lending protocol. The plan aimed to generate $70 million in annual yield,but faced sharp criticism over potential risks and competitive implications.\n\nMarc Zeller of the Aave Chan Initiative (ACI) responded with a proposal urging Aave to disengage from Polygon. Suggested measures included freezing asset reserves and restricting borrowing on Aave‚Äôs Polygon deployment, citing bridge vulnerabilities that have historically led to significant user losses. Zeller emphasized that such risks made continued collaboration untenable, pointing to past exploits such as the Harmony and Multichain bridge hacks.\n\nPolygon‚Äôs community ultimately rejected the Morpho proposal, citing concerns over added risks and the lack of user opt-in mechanisms for bridged asset investments. Despite this move, tensions escalated when Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal accused Aave of monopolistic behavior, calling the withdrawal proposal ‚Äúanti-competitive‚Äù and undermining innovation in Web3.\n\nAave‚Äôs founder Stani Kulechov defended the governance decision, arguing that prioritizing user security was central to the DAO‚Äôs responsibilities. However, the clash has left both sides at odds, with Aave‚Äôs potential exit still under discussion.\n\nEditorial Tensions Rise at CoinDesk Following Ownership Dispute Over Justin Sun Article\n\nAccording to a report by Fortune, crypto news outlet CoinDesk is grappling with internal tensions after its new owner, crypto exchange Bullish, reportedly pressured the publication to remove a controversial article about Tron founder Justin Sun. The article, published in late November, detailed Sun‚Äôs purchase of a $6.2 million banana artwork and his subsequent stunt of eating it, alongside his ongoing legal battles and allegations concerning Tron‚Äôs use in illicit financing.\n\nFollowing complaints from Sun‚Äôs team about the piece‚Äôs tone, Bullish, which acquired CoinDesk for $75 million last year, allegedly directed the outlet to take the article offline. The move led to protests from CoinDesk journalists, who raised concerns about editorial independence during a meeting with Bullish CEO Tom Farley and CoinDesk CEO Sara Stratoberdha. While the article was removed from CoinDesk‚Äôs site, it remains available through Yahoo News syndication.\n\nThe fallout has already prompted changes, including the resignation of Matt Murray, chair of CoinDesk‚Äôs editorial committee and former editor-in-chief of The Wall Street Journal. Murray stepped down on Monday, as reported by Fortune. His exit comes amidst Bullish‚Äôs announcement of a planned initial public offering, further complicating CoinDesk‚Äôs operational dynamics under its new ownership.\n\nPhoto by charlesdeluvio on Unsplash\nJudge Rules Against BiT Global in $1 Billion Lawsuit Over Coinbase‚Äôs wBTC Delisting\n\nA U.S. District Court has denied BiT Global‚Äôs request for a temporary restraining order to prevent Coinbase from delisting Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), clearing the way for the exchange to remove the token as planned. The ruling is a setback for BiT Global, which filed a $1 billion lawsuit accusing Coinbase of anti-competitive behavior after it announced plans to delist wBTC following its transition to a new custodian.\n\nBiT Global, which took over wBTC custody in partnership with BitGo, argued that Coinbase‚Äôs actions, including the promotion of its competing wrapped bitcoin product cbBTC, would cause ‚Äúimminent and irreparable harm.‚Äù However, Judge Araceli Mart√≠nez-Olgu√≠n rejected the request.\n\nCoinbase defended its decision, citing its right as a private company to control its listings. A representative told The Block, ‚ÄúThe idea that we‚Äôre like a water or electrical company, a utility that you have a right to plug into, is just bogus.‚Äù They also noted that Coinbase accounts for less than 1% of wBTC trading activity and dismissed the claims as ‚Äú foolish.‚Äù\n\nPhoto by PiggyBank on Unsplash\nCrenshaw‚Äôs SEC Reconfirmation Bid Ends as Senate Cancels Vote\n\nThe Senate Banking Committee has canceled the vote to reconfirm Caroline Crenshaw as an SEC commissioner, effectively ending her tenure. Initially delayed last week after Republican lawmakers opposed her nomination, the vote was rescheduled but ultimately canceled due to a lack of sufficient support, according to a report from Decrypt citing sources familiar with the process.\n\nCrenshaw, a prominent figure in the SEC‚Äôs regulatory approach to digital assets, faced vocal opposition from crypto industry advocates. Groups such as the Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund led campaigns to block her reappointment, citing her tough stance on crypto regulation. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also publicly called for her removal.\n\nWith Crenshaw‚Äôs term expiring and SEC Chair Gary Gensler and Commissioner Jaime Liz√°rraga stepping down in January, President-elect Donald Trump will oversee the appointment of three new commissioners.\n\nPhoto by Connor Gan on Unsplash\nFTX to Begin Creditor Distributions in Early January\n\nFTX‚Äôs bankruptcy estate announced that its court-approved Chapter 11 reorganization plan will take effect on Jan. 3, 2025, paving the way for creditor distributions to begin. The plan, which was first approved in October, allocates between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion for repayments.\n\nAccording to CEO John J. Ray III, ‚ÄúWe are well positioned to begin executing the distribution of recoveries back to all customers and creditors, and encourage customers to complete the necessary steps to begin receiving distributions in a timely manner.‚Äù\n\nFTX has partnered with Kraken and BitGo to manage the distribution process. Creditors can receive their payouts in stablecoins by converting fiat funds into digital assets via the FTX claims portal.\n\nThe ‚Äúinitial distribution‚Äù phase is expected to occur within 60 days of the plan‚Äôs effective date.\n\nPhoto by Mariia Shalabaieva on Unsplash\nEthena Launches USDtb and Partners With Trump‚Äôs World Liberty Financial\n\nEthena Labs has announced the launch of its new stablecoin, USDtb, a project backed by BlackRock‚Äôs BUIDL fund, which manages over half a billion dollars in U.S. Treasury bills. USDtb marks a shift from Ethena‚Äôs flagship USDe token, offering a more traditional asset-backed model. Unlike USDe, which uses market-driven derivative strategies, USDtb maintains its dollar peg through reserves equal to each USDtb token issued, over 90% of which are held in BlackRock‚Äôs tokenized fund.\n\nIn addition to its launch, Ethena disclosed a partnership with Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLF). The collaboration integrates Ethena‚Äôs staked USDe token (sUSDe) into WLF‚Äôs Aave instance, enabling users to deposit sUSDe and earn rewards in both Ethena‚Äôs tokens and WLF‚Äôs native token. Ethena has proposed sUSDe as a new collateral asset for WLF, with co-incentivized rewards expected to boost stablecoin liquidity and utilization across the platform.\n\nWe had Ethena Labs‚Äô founder Guy Young on the show this week, be sure to check it out if you haven‚Äôt yet!\n\nPENGU Airdrop Shakes Up Pudgy Penguins NFT Market\n\nThis week saw another airdrop make waves as the PENGU token launched alongside a dramatic shift in the market for Pudgy Penguins NFTs. The token, tied to the popular collection, debuted on Solana with a fully diluted valuation of $2.6 billion, quickly gaining over 200,000 holders. However, the launch caused the floor price of Pudgy Penguins NFTs to plummet nearly 50%, from 30 ETH to around 15.9 ETH, as holders rushed to claim their tokens. The drawdown is likely because NFT holders no longer felt the need to retain their tokens after claiming the airdrop.\n\nEach Pudgy Penguins NFT entitled its owner to 1.7 million PENGU tokens, valued at approximately $50,000. This broad distribution extended beyond NFT holders, with allocations for Ethereum and Solana users and a portion reserved for the Pudgy community. Despite some transactional hiccups on Solana during the claim process, the launch was hailed as a significant milestone for the brand‚Äôs expansion, following its growth across retail and social media.\n\nMicroStrategy Joins Nasdaq 100 Following Massive 2024 Bitcoin Rally\n\nThis week saw another milestone for MicroStrategy, as the company was announced as a new member of the Nasdaq 100 index, effective Dec. 23. Known for its aggressive bitcoin holdings, MicroStrategy has increasingly become a proxy for the cryptocurrency, with its shares rising more than 500% this year, far outpacing bitcoin‚Äôs 140% gain.\n\nThe inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 means ETFs such as the Invesco QQQ Trust, which manages $325 billion in assets, will now automatically buy MicroStrategy shares.\n\nEconomist Alex Kruger, speaking on this week‚Äôs Bits + Bips podcast, described the ripple effect of this addition: ‚ÄúAnytime anybody buys the Nasdaq either via ETFs or mutual funds or futures, you're literally buying MicroStrategy. What it does is it enables Saylor to sell more shares and to buy more Bitcoin. It‚Äôs simple math.‚Äù Kruger added that this dynamic could reverse under extreme market conditions, potentially creating a self-fulfilling cycle.\n\nNew Blockchain Projects Signal Strategic Moves Across the Industry\n\nThree blockchain initiatives made headlines this week with notable launches and developments that showcase different approaches to advancing decentralized technology.\n\nSonic Labs, a rebrand of the Fantom Foundation, officially launched its layer 1 blockchain, Sonic. The new network is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine and introduces features like faster transaction finality and a fee monetization model that allocates up to 90% of application-generated fees to developers. Sonic also announced a token airdrop of 190.5 million \"S\" tokens, valued at approximately $232 million, available on a 1:1 basis to holders of the Fantom blockchain‚Äôs native token FTM. The initiative aims to attract developers and users by providing financial incentives and a familiar development environment.\n\nIn addition, crypto exchange Kraken launched its layer 2 blockchain, Ink, built using Optimism‚Äôs Superchain technology. Ink supports interoperability with other OP Stack-based networks and has partnered with decentralized platforms such as Curve and Frax. Kraken also announced plans to implement permissionless fault proofs in early 2025 to enhance transaction accountability within the network.\n\nMeanwhile, TradFi giant Deutsche Bank revealed its plans for a layer 2 blockchain project utilizing ZKsync technology, as part of its involvement in the Monetary Authority of Singapore‚Äôs Project Guardian. The platform is designed to support compliance-driven applications, integrating tools for transaction oversight and risk mitigation. A minimum viable product is expected to launch in 2025, pending regulatory approval.\n\nWatch the Recap!\n\nTo stay updated with everything that‚Äôs going on in crypto, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nSubscribe\n4 Likes\n4\nShare",

Bitcoin accounted for most of that, with $215 million of liquidations, while Ethereum liquidations topped $181 million.\n\nThe market-wide decline comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve forecast only two interest rate cuts next year, a prognosis to which most risk-assets ‚Äî including U.S. equities ‚Äî reacted with negative price action.\n\nAmid the broader decline, spot bitcoin and ether ETFs ended a streak of 15 and 18 consecutive days of positive flows, respectively.\n\nData show that spot BTC ETFs saw $671.9 million in net outflows, while ETH funds saw $60.5 million melt away, less than 10% of BTC‚Äôs drain.\n\nDoodles NFT Floor Price Surges After Co-founder Hints at Token Launch\n\nScott Martin, perhaps better known by the pseudonym ‚ÄúBurnt Toast‚Äù and as a co-founder of the Doodles NFT collection, teased an impending token launch by the project in the near future.\n\n‚ÄúTake ownership, keep evolving new ideas, shape communities, open minds, inspire new growth,‚Äù Martin posted on X. For those that looked closer, the first letter of each word in that sentence read: ‚ÄúToken is coming.‚Äù\n\nIn the 24 hours to press time, the floor price of Doodles NFTs surged 75% to 7.3 ETH ($24,760). Trading volume for the collection was up 1,494% to 4,759 ETH during the same period.\n\nThe Doodles team‚Äôs hint of a token launch comes after the creators of the Pudgy Penguins NFT series airdropped the PENGU token to their community of users. Despite being launched only this week, PENGU is already trading at a market cap of $1.75 billion.\n\nEthereum Validators Get Behind Higher Gas Limit\n\nEthereum validators are showing increasing support for raising the network's gas limit.\n\nAs of Thursday, 15.4% of validators were signalling support for an increase beyond the current 30 million gas limit, according to data shared by Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni Wahrst√§tter.\n\nThat is a significant jump from fewer than 1% before Dec. 2.\n\nThe proposed gas limit increase would boost network capacity, with more transactions included per block, and potentially reduce transaction fees by 15% to as much as 33%.\n\nWahrst√§tter proposed increasing the gas limit to 36 million to start with in order to monitor the network‚Äôs response and prevent instability.\n\nCoinbase-run validators are in the camp of those following that recommendation, and are among those showing support for a higher limit.\n\n‚ÄúThis system of signaling allows validators to democratically influence the gas limit with each block they propose,‚Äù the Coinbase Developer Platform posted on X.\n\nPhoto by Tokenstreet on Unsplash\nSui and Aptos See Changes at the Top\n\nTwo up-and-coming layer 1 blockchains have announced management changes at their respective foundations. Sui has welcomed a new managing director, and Aptos has announced the departure of a co-founder and CEO.\n\nThe Sui Foundation appointed Christian Thompson as its new managing director to lead the blockchain‚Äôs next growth phase. Thompson‚Äôs previous roles include chief information security officer at Web3 infrastructure company Mysten Labs, and also deputy chief information security officer at Meta, where he was an early member of the now-defunct Diem/Libra project.\n\nAnother early member of Diem, Mo Shaikh, announced a surprise exit from his role as CEO of Aptos, a project he co-founded with fellow Diem contributor Avery Ching in 2021.\n\nChing will assume the CEO role, while Shaikh will stay on as a strategic advisor.\n\nShaikh said he was stepping away ‚Äúto start a new chapter‚Äù and that he will be taking ‚Äúsome much-needed time to reflect on where the world is headed‚Äù over the next few months.\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

Young and Tikta\nPolygon Community to Reject Proposal for Yield on Bridged Assets\n\nPolygon‚Äôs proposal to try to earn yield on bridged assets is unlikely to progress following community feedback, as Polygon Labs and its co-founder, Sandeep Nailwal, called out Aave‚Äôs leadership for what they claimed was an attempt to manipulate the Polygon ecosystem through competitive threats.\n\nLast week, Polygon community members submitted an initial governance proposal that entailed using Aave competitor Morpho to enable bridged assets to earn a yield.\n\nKraken Launches Ink Layer 2\n\nCrypto exchange Kraken has launched an Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution named Ink on its mainnet.\n\nThe launch, which the exchange said in a blog had come ‚Äúmonths ahead of schedule,‚Äù was a product of ‚Äústrong interest‚Äù from builders.\n\nInk runs on Optimism‚Äôs Superchain technology stack, and is progressing towards stage 1 decentralization with permissionless fault proofs.\n\nSince Ink was deployed on Kraken‚Äôs testnet in October, more than 8.17 million transactions have been processed and 90,600 tokens have been deployed.\n\nThe L2‚Äôs day-one partners include Curve, Frax, LayerZero, Pyth and Alchemy.\n\nPhoto by PiggyBank on Unsplash\nAndre Cronje‚Äôs Sonic Labs Announces L1 Launch, Token Airdrop\n\nSonic Labs announced on Wednesday the mainnet launch of a new L1, Ethereum virtual machine-compatible blockchain that has a fee monetization feature for application developers.\n\nAlthough Sonic Labs is a rebrand of the Fantom Foundation, previously tasked with developing the Opera blockchain, which uses FTM as its native token, the freshly rolled-out network boasts a number of upgrades such as faster transaction finality and a new token.\n\nSynthetix Reboots Exchange With Multi-Collateral Perps on Base\n\nDecentralized finance protocol Synthetix is relaunching its exchange with support for multi-collateral perpetuals on the Base network.\n\nUsers can now trade using cbBTC, cbETH, wstETH, and wETH as collateral, in addition to U.S. dollars.\n\nTo boost liquidity, Synthetix has launched a four-week \"Decembrrrr Base LP Incentives\" program, offering rewards in SNX and USDC.\n\nThe relaunch represents a departure from Synthetix's previous strategy of providing back-end liquidity and infrastructure as it aims to evolve into a primary product issuer.\n\nEthena Labs Partners With Trump‚Äôs World Liberty Financial\n\nEthena Labs has formed a strategic partnership with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a DeFi project backed by president-elect Donald Trump.\n\nThe Ethena Labs team announced the partnership on X, also sharing details of a governance proposal to add Ethena‚Äôs staked synthetic dollar, sUSDe, to WLFI‚Äôs Aave V3 instance as collateral.\n\n‚ÄúShould it pass, this proposal will enable World Liberty Financial users to benefit from sUSDe rewards and also WLF token rewards,‚Äù Ethena Labs said.\n\nData from crypto analytics firm Arkham show that WLF has around $79.8 million of crypto assets in its portfolio. WLF‚Äôs biggest position is $54 million of ETH. It currently holds $815,000 of Ethena Labs‚Äô native token, ENA.\n\nListen to Ethena Labs‚Äô Guy Young‚Äôs interview with Laura on Tuesday's Unchained podcast.\n\nPump.fun Becomes First Solana DApp to Top $100M in Monthly Revenue\n\nPump.fun, a decentralized marketplace that allows users to create and trade memecoins, has become the first Solana-based protocol to generate more than $100 million in monthly revenue.\n\nResearch by decentralized asset management platform Syndica found that the protocol generated revenue of $106 million in November, representing more than a quarter of all revenue generated by Solana decentralized applications (DApps).\n\nSolana-based memecoin DApps, specifically, have seen a 305x increase in monthly revenue this year and have generated a total of around $500 million of revenue.\n\nIn November, Unchained reported that Pump.fun had shattered records for monthly fees, daily active addresses, and daily tokens launched.\n\nKristin Smith on Why This Is Crypto‚Äôs Time to ‚ÄòGet Policy Done‚Äô\n\nAt the Blockchain Association Policy Summit in DC, BA CEO explains what a pro-crypto Congress and president mean for the industry and what could bring builders back to the U.S.\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

Young and Tikta\nLido Finance on Track for First Profitable Year as It Turns 4\n\nLido Finance, the decentralized protocol that introduced liquid staking, turned four years old on Tuesday and is currently on course to generate a yearly profit for the first time since it was founded.\n\nLido‚Äôs 2024 net revenue stands at more than $99 million, while its outgoings add up to around $94 million, making the protocol‚Äôs net income some $5 million, according to data from a Dune Analytics dashboard curated by crypto advisory and consulting firm Steakhouse Financial, which also helps to create financial statements for Lido.\n\nPudgy Penguins‚Äô PENGU Drops 54% on Debut\n\nThe Pudgy Penguins native token, PENGU, nosedived almost immediately after it began trading following its launch yesterday.\n\nThe Solana-based token initially surged to $0.069 but quickly plummeted more than 54% to around $0.028 in less than five hours, representing a dive in market capitalization from $4.36 billion to less than $1.81 billion.\n\nThe decline was mirrored in the NFT market, where the floor price of Pudgy Penguins NFTs tanked from 29 ETH ($111,330) to around 15 ETH.\n\nThe airdrop distributed around half of PENGU‚Äôs total supply of 89 billion tokens to eligible users. Around 26% of the tokens were earmarked for the Pudgy community, while 24% were allocated to other communities that have yet to be identified.\n\nDespite a number of airdrop recipients rushing to sell their tokens, some managed to make sizable profits in the initial frenzy of trading. One PENGU holder trousered $8.36 million in less than 20 minutes, according to a post by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain.\n\nTether Invests in European Stablecoin Issuer Stable as MiCA Looms\n\nTether, the company behind the USDT stablecoin, has announced a strategic investment in European stablecoin issuer StablR.\n\nStablR has introduced two stablecoins ‚Äî the euro-pegged EURR and the U.S. dollar-pegged USDR ‚Äî designed to streamline transactions and offer cost savings for users.\n\nTether‚Äôs investment comes as the European Union prepares to implement the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework on Dec. 30.\n\nUSDT is not currently MiCA-compliant, so instead of modifying its flagship stablecoin, Tether appears to be investing in MiCA-compliant entities instead.\n\nThe European stablecoin market has experienced significant growth in recent months, with a total capitalization approaching $400 million for euro-pegged coins.\n\nPhoto by CoinWire Japan on Unsplash\nEthereum Foundation‚Äôs ETH Sales Reach $12.6M This Year\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting Ethereum and its ecosystem, sold another $420,000 of ETH for Maker DAO‚Äôs DAI token ‚Äî rebranded as USDS ‚Äî on Tuesday.\n\nThe latest sale brings the sum of ETH offloaded by the foundation this year to $12.6 million, according to data from blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain.\n\nETH was down 4.5% in the 24 hours before press time, trading at $3,828. Some market participants have attributed its negative price performance to the foundation‚Äôs sale.\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has commented on that assertion on a number of occasions, most recently in October, when he reminded one user that the funds were used to pay researchers and developers.\n\nPhoto by Michael F√∂rtsch on Unsplash\nBitcoin Policy Institute Drafts Executive Order for Strategic BTC Reserve\n\nThe Bitcoin Policy Institute think tank has drafted an executive order for the signature of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump proposing the establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve within the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund.\n\nThe draft, shared by Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey, calls for allocating $21 billion from the stabilization fund to acquiring bitcoin.\n\nThe proposed order would also require that all government bitcoin holdings be consolidated, and would prohibit sales, swaps or auctions of bitcoins by any federal agency.\n\nThe order aligns with Trump's pledge to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve asset.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\nCoinbase‚Äôs Law Enforcement Requests Drop 18%\n\nCrypto exchange Coinbase says it received a total of 10,707 information requests from law enforcement agencies between October 2023 and September 2024, an 18% decrease year on year.\n\nIn its latest Transparency Report, the exchange said the U.S. still accounted for the highest volume of law enforcement information requests, although there had been a ‚Äúslight decrease‚Äù in that number this year.\n\nThe most significant reductions in law enforcement info requests came from countries such as Germany, the UK, and Spain, while the most substantial increase came from Singapore, with a surge of 221% during the period.\n\n‚ÄúAs in years past, the overwhelming majority of requests we received both globally and in the U.S. were from law enforcement agencies in connection with criminal enforcement matters,‚Äù said Coinbase‚Äôs chief legal officer, Paul Grewal.\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

Young and Tikta\nAave DAO Mulls Split From Polygon Following Morpho Move\n\nAave DAO is considering a breakup with Polygon.\n\nAave Chan Initiative, a service provider for the largest lending protocol in the DeFi space, published a governance proposal on Monday to exit from the Polygon network.\n\nThe proposal calls for six recommendations to incentivize migration away from Polygon, including freezing the reserves of several assets on Aave V3 and setting the loan-to-value ratio to 0% for all assets on Aave‚Äôs V2 and V3 instances of Polygon. As a result, Polygon users would not be able to borrow any capital on Aave against deposited collateral.\n\nThe move comes in response to a Polygon pre-proposal to use lending protocol Morpho to generate a $70 million annual yield on its $1.3 billion in bridged stablecoins.\n\nFTX Distributions to Start in Under 2 Weeks\n\nFTX‚Äôs bankruptcy estate yesterday announced that its court-approved Chapter 11 plan of reorganization will become effective on Jan. 3, 2025.\n\nThe plan was first approved in October, with between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion marked for distributions to creditors.\n\n‚ÄúWe are well positioned to begin executing the distribution of recoveries back to all customers and creditors, and encourage customers to complete the necessary steps to begin receiving distributions in a timely manner,‚Äù said CEO John Ray.\n\nFTX has entered into agreements with digital asset custody platform BitGo and U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken to distribute the recovered funds to creditors.\n\nAccording to FTX‚Äôs claims portal, creditors can receive their bankruptcy payouts in stablecoins by converting their fiat to digital assets.\n\nEther.Fi Proposes Token Buyback to Reward Stakers\n\nEthereum-based decentralized staking protocol Ether.Fi has proposed a new buyback strategy aimed at enhancing the utility and market strength of its ETHFI token.\n\nA proposal posted to Ether.Fi‚Äôs governance forum on Monday called for allocating 5% of the protocol's monthly revenue to buy back ETHFI tokens from the market and then distribute those tokens to stakers as a reward.\n\nIn order to qualify for the rewards, users must have been staking ETHFI for at least one month prior to the distribution cutoff.\n\nEther.Fi already buys back tokens from its main liquidity pool ‚Äî something that the protocol claims has brought around $2 million of onchain liquidity to the ETHFI market since July.\n\nEther.Fi is the fourth-largest DeFi protocol, with $9.5 billion in total value locked, according to data from blockchain analytics platform DeFiLlama.\n\nAvalanche‚Äôs Biggest Upgrade Goes Live on Mainnet\n\nLayer 1 blockchain Avalanche has launched what it describes as its biggest network upgrade ‚Äî Avalanche9000.\n\nThe team behind the blockchain said the upgrade was live on the mainnet, and it expects the new infrastructure to reduce the cost of deploying a layer 1 by 99.99%.\n\nAvalanche9000 will also bring down the minimum gas fee on its C-Chain by 96% and connect layer 1s ‚Äî formerly known as subnets ‚Äî with enhanced interchain messaging that will enable better communication and shared liquidity.\n\nThe upgrade is expected to have a big impact on Web3 games thanks to its lower barriers to entry for developers who want to explore utilizing blockchain for building games.\n\nCurve‚Äôs Michael Egorov Buys $1.2M of CRV Tokens\n\nCurve Finance founder Michael Egorov has acquired 1.08 million CRV tokens for around $1.2 million, according to data from blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain.\n\nEgorov acquired the tokens over the course of three hours late on Monday. The purchases are Egorov‚Äôs first major buyback since his massive onchain loans were liquidated in June.\n\nThe price of CRV dropped around 7% in the 24 hours preceding Egorov‚Äôs token purchases.

That came around a month after Coinbase launched its own competing wrapped bitcoin product, cbBTC.\n\nIn the complaint, BiT Global claims that it stands to lose more than $1 billion in market valuation as a result of Coinbase's actions.\n\n‚ÄúHaving decided to copycat WBTC with its own product, Coinbase resorted to unfair and deceptive tactics that have long been used by tech giants to crush their competition,‚Äù BiT Global said.\n\nThe corporate registry for BiT Global Trust Ltd. lists five shareholders, all based at the same address in the British Virgin Islands, one of which is named \"Global Ayn Ltd.,\" likely a reference to ultra-libertarian writer Ayn Rand, of whom Sun is known to be a fan.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\nExpect RLUSD Shortage at Launch, Ripple CTO Warns\n\nRipple CTO David Schwartz expects the early days of trade for RLUSD, the company‚Äôs new U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, to be fairly volatile.\n\nIn a post on X, he said: ‚ÄúThere actually is someone willing to pay $1,200/RLUSD for a tiny fraction of one RLUSD.‚Äù\n\nRLUSD was recently approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services.\n\nThe stablecoin, issued on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, is designed to facilitate cross-border transactions, increase liquidity, and provide seamless on-ramps and off-ramps for crypto and fiat currencies.\n\n‚ÄúIf you want to spend a lot of money to get a tiny bit of RLUSD before anyone else does, you can. But please don't expect the price to stay over $1 once things stabilize, which I expect they will do very quickly,‚Äù Schwartz said, warning users not to ‚ÄúFOMO into a stablecoin.‚Äù\n\nRLUSD is expected to be listed on crypto exchanges in the near future, with blockchain data showing that 13 million of the coins have been minted by the RLUSD treasury.\n\nMicroStrategy Joins Nasdaq-100, Expanding Bitcoin Exposure to Billions\n\nMicroStrategy is set to join the Nasdaq-100 following its annual reshuffle, making Michael Saylor‚Äôs company the first Bitcoin-centric firm included in the index and positioning it alongside tech giants such as Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft.\n\nThe move, effective Dec. 23, will also incorporate MicroStrategy into ETFs tracking the Nasdaq-100, such as the $300 billion Invesco QQQ Trust.\n\nThe index inclusion could expose MicroStrategy‚Äôs stock to billions of dollars of passive investment flows, further linking it to bitcoin‚Äôs performance. The company currently holds $42 billion of bitcoin, making its shares a proxy for the original cryptocurrency.\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

French Hill to Lead House Financial Services Committee\n\nArkansas Republican Representative French Hill has been appointed chair of the influential House Financial Services Committee, starting in the next congressional session on Jan. 3. The committee is charged with overseeing and developing financial legislation before it heads to a full House or Senate vote and frequently hears testimonies from leading figures in the financial sector including bankers, regulators, and economists. Hill, known for his deep understanding of cryptocurrency and blockchain, has been a key figure in shaping crypto policy as chair of its subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion.\n\nHill has promised to prioritize passing legislation on crypto market structure and stablecoins, aiming to clarify whether cryptocurrencies are classified as securities or commodities and to establish robust collateral requirements for stablecoin issuers. His leadership is expected to strengthen bipartisan efforts on crypto legislation because of his history of bridging divides within Congress.\n\nWith the committee overseeing the SEC and CFTC, Hill‚Äôs appointment signals a proactive approach to crypto regulation.\n\nMicrosoft Shareholders Reject Bitcoin Investment Proposal\n\nMicrosoft shareholders have rejected a proposal to allocate company funds to bitcoin, following recommendations from the company‚Äôs leadership, with less than 1% of them voting in favor. The initiative, introduced by conservative think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research, suggested using bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, citing its limited supply and historical performance.\n\nMicrosoft‚Äôs chief financial officer Amy Hood emphasized the firm‚Äôs commitment to preserving capital and liquidity to support operations, stating that the company has evaluated cryptocurrencies and continues to monitor the space.\n\nMicroStrategy‚Äôs executive chairman, Michael Saylor, who has championed bitcoin investments, argued during the meeting that adopting bitcoin could yield substantial financial gains for Microsoft. Despite his advocacy and the cryptocurrency‚Äôs remarkable performance this year, the proposal failed to gain shareholder support.\n\nTexas Proposes Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in New Legislation\n\nTexas State Representative Giovanni Capriglione has introduced a bill to establish a bitcoin strategic reserve for the state. The legislation aims to position Texas as a leader in digital asset innovation while enhancing financial security for its residents.\n\nIf passed, the bill would enable Texas to acquire and hold bitcoin in reserve for a minimum of five years, with provisions allowing citizens to contribute donations to the fund. The reserve would serve as a long-term hedge and bolster Texas‚Äôs standing in the crypto economy.\n\nThe initiative mirrors similar efforts being discussed at the national level, signaling growing interest in integrating bitcoin into government-level financial strategies.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\nGoogle‚Äôs Willow Quantum Chip Sparks Controversy\n\nGoogle‚Äôs new quantum computing chip, Willow, has ignited debate across the crypto community, raising concerns about the security of older Bitcoin wallets and the broader implications for blockchain encryption. The chip boasts a 105-qubit capability which means it can complete tasks in minutes which would otherwise take millennia, highlighting the vulnerability of outdated wallet formats such as Bitcoin‚Äôs Pay-To-Public-Key (P2PK) system.\n\nThese older wallets, which include the 1.1 million bitcoins held by Satoshi Nakamoto, could now be at risk of being breached by quantum algorithms. Avalanche founder Emin G√ºn Sirer proposed freezing Satoshi‚Äôs coins to mitigate the threat, suggesting a ‚Äúsunset date‚Äù for P2PK unspent transaction outputs. ‚ÄúAs quantum computing gets threatening, the Bitcoin community might want to look into freezing these coins,‚Äù Sirer said on X.\n\nWhile some developers advocate upgrading blockchains to quantum-resistant cryptography, the idea of freezing coins has proven divisive. Critics argue such actions could undermine decentralization, while others see it as necessary to maintain Bitcoin‚Äôs integrity as quantum computing advances.\n\nMagic Eden‚Äôs ME Token Launch Highlights Airdrop Frenzy\n\nMagic Eden, the leading Solana-based NFT marketplace, launched its ecosystem token, ME, on Tuesday amid significant anticipation, but it wasn‚Äôt without challenges. Early trading saw ME‚Äôs fully diluted valuation soar to $15 billion before stabilizing at approximately $4.5 billion.\n\nThe token airdrop was marred by technical issues, with users reporting problems with accessing the claim process via the Magic Eden wallet app. Errors like ‚Äúsomething went wrong‚Äù and confusing prompts frustrated participants, some missing the opportunity to capitalize on early price spikes.\n\nDespite these hurdles, over 70,000 users claimed nearly 69 million ME tokens in the first hour, according to Magic Eden. The chaotic rollout highlighted the challenges of large-scale airdrops but also underscored the growing popularity of such initiatives.\n\nOther projects such as Fuel and Movement Network are also leveraging airdrops to engage users. Fuel, an Ethereum rollup, introduced its native FUEL token this week, while Movement Network also launched its mainnet beta and token, utilizing the Move programming language for secure and efficient transactions.\n\nElizabeth Warren to Influence SEC Commissioner Selection\n\nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, known for her critical stance on cryptocurrency, is poised to have significant influence in selecting the next Democratic SEC commissioner. According to party insiders, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has given Warren a pivotal role in recommending candidates to replace outgoing commissioners Gary Gensler and Jaime Liz√°rraga.\n\nThe SEC can only have three commissioners from the same political party. With one Democratic spot still open, Warren‚Äôs input could shape the future of the agency‚Äôs approach to crypto regulation.\n\nSchumer‚Äôs decision also reflects a political test for Warren. Sources told Unchained that Schumer, who is a moderate, is challenging her to nominate a candidate who can secure confirmation in a Republican-majority Senate. If Warren‚Äôs choice fails, it could bolster Schumer‚Äôs case for a more centrist approach.\n\nBinance and Circle Forge Alliance to Drive USDC Adoption\n\nBinance, the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange, and Circle, the issuer of the stablecoin USDC, announced a partnership aimed at expanding USDC's global reach. Revealed at Abu Dhabi Finance Week, the collaboration seeks to enhance USDC‚Äôs role across Binance‚Äôs ecosystem, including trading, payments, savings, and corporate treasury operations.\n\n‚ÄúThis represents a major shift in the emerging crypto market structure,‚Äù said Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire on X.\n\nBinance plans to integrate USDC more extensively into its services, providing its 240 million users with greater access to the stablecoin. Additionally, Binance will adopt USDC as its primary treasury stablecoin.\n\nThe development also positions Binance and Circle to navigate the European Union's upcoming MiCA regulatory framework, which may limit the use of less transparent stablecoins such as Tether‚Äôs USDT.\n\nPhoto by CoinWire Japan on Unsplash\n\nAlso this week, Circle announced the upcoming launch of the second version of its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol in early 2025 to enable faster USDC transfers with low-latency settlements across Ethereum, Base, and Avalanche, with plans for broader blockchain integration.\n\nRipple‚Äôs RLUSD Stablecoin Secures New York Approval\n\nRipple‚Äôs RLUSD stablecoin has received final regulatory approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), paving the way for its official launch. Ripple‚Äôs CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced the milestone on social media, stating that exchange and partner listings for RLUSD will be activated soon.\n\nThe stablecoin, first unveiled in April, operates on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum networks. Testing began in August, with Ripple forming partnerships to ensure liquidity and adoption. Notable collaborators include exchanges Uphold, Bitstamp, and Bitso, as well as market makers B2C2 and Keyrock.\n\nEthena‚Äôs USDe Becomes Third-Largest Stablecoin\n\nEthena Labs‚Äô synthetic stablecoin USDe has surged to become the third-largest stablecoin, with a market capitalization of $5.65 billion, overtaking Maker‚Äôs DAI (now known as USDS) at $5.2 billion. The leap follows the addition of its staked version, sUSDe, as a collateral asset on Aave in November, driving significant adoption and liquidity.\n\nAave‚Äôs integration enabled users to leverage the ‚ÄúAavethena‚Äù strategy, which involves depositing sUSDe as collateral then borrowing Tether‚Äôs USDT or Circle‚Äôs USDC, and recycling funds into more sUSDe. This strategy boosted Aave‚Äôs stablecoin borrowing rates to over 20%, said Ethena‚Äôs head of growth Seraphim on X.\n\nUSDe‚Äôs unique model collateralizes with assets such as bitcoin and ether, hedging them through short positions to generate a yield currently at 27%. This yield-centric approach has drawn investors seeking passive income, propelling USDe‚Äôs rapid rise in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nCoinbase Responds to Criticism Over Account Restrictions\n\nCoinbase has addressed user frustrations regarding account restrictions, attributing the issue to a surge in fraudulent activity following the U.S. presidential election. In a statement posted on X, the exchange explained that its fraud prevention systems were working as intended amid a significant increase in new and returning users. Coinbase noted a ‚Äú2-3x increase in fraudulent attempts,‚Äù which led to more restricted accounts and longer customer service wait times.\n\nThe exchange dismissed claims of widespread restrictions as misinformation but acknowledged user concerns, stating that it is working to resolve issues quickly. Some users still criticized Coinbase‚Äôs response, sharing experiences of prolonged restrictions and inadequate support.\n\nPhoto by PiggyBank on Unsplash\nWatch the Recap!\n\nTo stay updated with everything that‚Äôs going on in crypto, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nSubscribe\n1\nShare",

Young and Tikta\nHow Warren‚Äôs Power on Senate Banking Is Backfiring in Caroline Crenshaw Confirmation\n\nThe odds of Democratic U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw being confirmed by the Senate for another term are waning after her nomination became a political lightning rod for the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday.\n\nRather than waiting to put her confirmation to a vote in the next Senate session, Democrats have decided to push a committee vote through during the Biden administration‚Äôs lame duck period, inflaming political tensions.\n\nThe vote would bring Crenshaw‚Äôs confirmation to the Senate floor in the hope that members confirm her before the current session ends.\n\nThat strategy, sources say, stems partly from the influence Senator Elizabeth Warren has gained over the Democratic SEC commissioner selection process, which Unchained reported on last week.\n\nHowever, it is also partly a political test of Warren by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who faces pressure from progressive lobbying groups to bring a vote to the floor.\n\n(Shutterstock)\nA Big 2024 Crypto Trend: Devs Flock to Solana\n\nThe number of developers in crypto has grown over the long term, but this year‚Äôs bull market has seen new trends among builders that reflect a shifting balance both geographically and by blockchain network, according to venture firm Electric Capital‚Äôs 2024 developer report, published on Thursday.\n\nSolana is the No. 1 ecosystem for new developers. Among the 39,148 new developers exploring crypto this year, 7,625 come from Solana, according to Electric Capital‚Äôs research.\n\nAccording to Maria Shen, a general partner on the firm‚Äôs investment team, Solana‚Äôs role in attracting a record number of new developers is momentous, because, she says, ‚ÄúThis is the first year that Solana has brought on more new developer interest than Ethereum.‚Äù\n\nBase Behind 42% of New Code in Ethereum Ecosystem\n\nOf all the new code written in the Ethereum ecosystem, Coinbase‚Äôs layer 2 network, Base, is alone responsible for 42%, according to Electric Capital.\n\nThe firm found that Base owns 97% of NFT minting volume and ranks second after Solana in decentralized exchange usage, based on unique trading wallets.\n\nThat concentrated developer activity comes amid blockchain infrastructure builders‚Äô shift in focus from Ethereum ‚Äî which nevertheless remains the top ecosystem for total developer activity ‚Äî to Solana.\n\nHowever, the fastest growing ecosystems based on overall developer activity are EigenLayer, which grew 167%, year on year, and Aptos, which expanded 96%.\n\nCrypto-Savvy Rep. French Hill Will Chair House Financial Services Committee\n\nArkansas Republican Rep.

We told you so. ü´§\nVERONICA IRWIN\nDEC 13, 2024\n2\nShare\n\nHey! I‚Äôm Veronica Irwin, Unchained‚Äôs regulatory reporter.\n\nIf you‚Äôve been reading this newsletter, then you might have seen the drama over Democratic SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw coming.¬†\n\nLast week, we wrote about how Warren, as next year‚Äôs minority leader on the Senate Banking Committee, had a lot of power over the selection of Democratic nominees for the SEC. Typically it would be the protocol for next year‚Äôs Senate Minority Leader, New York Democrat Chuck Schumer, to recommend to president-elect Trump who he should nominate for Democratic vacancies on the commission.¬†\n\nBut Schumer was letting Warren lead on whose names the Dems preferred ‚Äî in part because she is supposed to have a lot of say as the incoming Ranking Member, or minority leader, on the Senate Banking Committee ‚Äì but also because it was a way to test whether Warren could be a little less radical for once. If she couldn‚Äôt, the gamble was that she would fail spectacularly and lose some of her grasp on power within the Democratic party.¬†\n\nWell, we‚Äôre starting to see the effects of that bear out in Congress this week. Whether Schumer‚Äôs gamble turns out as expected is yet to be seen.¬†\n\nHow Warren's Power on Senate Banking Is Backfiring in Caroline Crenshaw Confirmation\n\nWarren has newfound power over the SEC nomination process. Crypto helped her get there.\n\nWarren is crypto‚Äôs fiercest critic in Congress (Shutterstock)\n\nThe odds of Democratic Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw being confirmed by the Senate for another term are falling after her nomination became a political lightning rod in the Senate Banking Committee Wednesday.¬†\n\nRather than waiting to put her confirmation to a vote in the Senate next session, progressive Democrats have decided to rush through a committee vote during the lame duck period, inflaming political tensions. The vote would bring Crenshaw‚Äôs confirmation to the floor of the Senate in the hope that Members of Congress confirm her before the session ends. This strategy, sources say, is partly the product of the power Senator Elizabeth Warren gained over the Democratic SEC commissioner selection process, which we reported on last week. However, it is also partly a political test of Warren by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who faces pressure from progressive lobbying groups to bring a vote to the floor.\n\nThree lobbyists who spoke to Unchained said that because of the last-minute push, they did not expect Senators to cooperate in confirming Crenshaw before the end of the year. Republicans have long been hesitant to confirm Crenshaw, frustrated by her stance on both crypto as well as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting, and the push has only further politicized her confirmation. Crypto groups have also sprung into action to fight her approval in the Senate, launching advertisements that criticize her intolerance of the industry.¬†\n\n‚ÄúThis [nomination] vote is a Brown/Warren political ploy,‚Äù said Paradigm VP of Government Affairs Alexander Grieve on X. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a middle finger to Rs, Schumer, and Crypto.‚Äù¬†\n\nRead More: Warren Will Have Significant Say in Selecting the Democratic SEC Commissioner\n\nHow Crenshaw‚Äôs Re-Nomination Became High Stakes\n\nAfter Commissioner Jaime Liz√°rraga and Chair Gary Gensler announced they would step down from the SEC in January, pressure was put on the Senate to confirm at least one Democratic commissioner as soon as possible.¬†\n\nThe law states that no more than three commissioners of the same political party can serve on the commission, and after Trump announced he would nominate Republican Paul Atkins to serve as chair, he, in addition to existing Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, take up all three Republican slots. Typically, the other two spots on the commission would be filled by Democrats.¬†\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic commissioner Caroline Crenshaw‚Äôs term expired in June, and her nomination to serve another term by President Biden went unconfirmed by the Senate largely due to Republican resistance. She currently serves on the commission under an unusual extension granted to commissioners for exactly this type of situation, though she has to be replaced by the end of 2025.¬†\n\nIf both Democratic vacancies went unfilled until inauguration, Trump would have had to nominate non-Republican commissioners. In an awkward scenario such as this, the protocol is typically for the Senate leader of the opposing party ‚Äî in this case, Schumer ‚Äî to recommend to Trump who to select.¬†\n\nIn return for Trump nominating the Democrat Schumer recommends, Schumer would then make sure the Senate Democrats he leads would confirm Atkins. But as we reported last week, Schumer was giving Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Warren a lot of say in who those Democrats should be.¬†\n\nRead More: Democratic SEC Commissioner is Stepping Down, but That Doesn‚Äôt mean Trump Will Get 2 Outright Picks\n\nHow Schumer Is Testing Warren\n\nSchumer is deferring to Warren for two reasons. First, Warren will be Ranking Member, or senior Democrat, on the Senate Banking Committee next year and the Senator in that position has the de facto role of being a thought leader on Democratic financial policy. Second, sources connected to elected officials (three more of whom have confirmed this calculus to Unchained in more detail since we originally published) said that Schumer was making a political gamble.¬†\n\nOne possibility is that Warren would either moderate herself and convince other leftist Democrats, like Sherrod Brown, to let the Democratic SEC commissioner selection process go smoothly by waiting until next session and perhaps even nominating someone more moderate than Crenshaw.¬†\n\nIf she couldn‚Äôt (or refused to), Schumer is betting a more radical plan would fail, and Warren would lose the power she currently commands over some of the more left-leaning members of the Democratic party for her mistake. As one source colorfully put it: Schumer is giving Warren ‚Äúenough rope to hang herself.‚Äù¬†\n\nThe Progressive Dems‚Äô Bet\n\nFive of the six total sources who were available to talk before publication said Democrats‚Äô rush to put Crenshaw‚Äôs confirmation to a vote before the end of the year is, in part, a product of this political calculus. Warren is leading the push with outgoing Senator Sherrod Brown, who will be replaced by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno after pro-crypto political action committee Fairshake poured over $40 million into ousting him and so who has a bone to pick with crypto.¬†\n\nSome Democrats (presumably Warren and Brown), are also concerned that they may not have the opportunity to confirm a Democrat at all next session if Trump goes off-script. Because the law does not require a balance of Republicans and Democrats but rather says that ‚Äúno more than three commissioners may belong to the same political party,‚Äù it‚Äôs possible that Trump would ignore Democrats entirely and nominate independent commissioners (an idea he flirted with under his first administration).¬†\n\nRepublicans technically will have the power to confirm commissioners without Democrat cooperation because they will control a majority of the Senate next year, though sources who spoke to Unchained said too many of them would be concerned about preserving established protocol to go along with Trump‚Äôs plan.¬†\n\nThe Senate Banking Committee was scheduled to vote on whether to advance Crenshaw‚Äôs confirmation to the Senate floor on Wednesday, and was expected to do so along party lines. However, the vote was blocked on procedural grounds which require Republican members to cooperate in waiving a restriction on the amount of time committees can meet.\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nCrypto-Savvy Rep.

I‚Äôm Veronica Irwin, Unchained‚Äôs regulatory reporter.\n\nMore good news for crypto: Arkansas Republican French Hill will be the leader of the House Financial Services Committee.¬†\n\nThis means that one of crypto‚Äôs strongest allies in Congress is in the position to kick-start stablecoin and market structure legislation next term (in fact, he promised to do so last summer). With Hill in control, it‚Äôs possible that crypto could have much of the regulatory clarity it‚Äôs asked for over the past several years by the end of 2025.¬†\n\nCrypto-Savvy Rep. French Hill Will Chair House Financial Services Committee\n\nHill is currently chair of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion.\n\nHill is known to be one of the more informed members of Congress on the technical aspects of cryptocurrency and the business models used in the industry (French Hill)\n\nArkansas Republican Rep. French Hill will chair the House Financial Services Committee in the next Congressional session starting on Jan. 3, putting him in charge of a committee critical to passing crypto legislation focused on stablecoins and market structure, and also making him an important figure in the oversight of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The vote was first announced by Punchbowl News on X.\n\nHill ran against Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr, Oklahoma Rep. Frank Lucas, and Michigan Rep. Bill Huizinga to replace North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, who is retiring at the end of the current session. However, the race was primarily between Hill and Barr, with the other Representatives viewed as minor contenders weeks before the November election.¬†\n\nWhy this Committee Matters\n\nThe House Financial Services committee works with the Senate Banking committee to oversee the SEC, which Trump nominated Paul Atkins to lead last week. It also works with the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, which together oversee the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to develop financial legislation around areas such as crypto market structure and stablecoin legislation before these bills go to a full House or Senate vote.\n\nRead More: South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson Likely to Lead Digital Assets Subcommittee\n\n\"Rep. Hill is seen as a leader in the crypto space dating back to his days leading the first Fintech task force and more recently as the Digital Asset subcommittee Chair,\" explained Ron Hammond, Blockchain Association Director of Government Relations. \"Rep. Hill is also a proven bridge builder in bringing Democrats into the fold for major legislative priorities to ensure crypto will not only remain bipartisan, but also top of the list in terms of priorities for the next Congress.\" The decision by the GOP steering committee to elevate Hill, who is currently the vice chair of the Financial Services Committee.\n\nHill‚Äôs Crypto Credentials\n\nOn the Unchained podcast in July, Hill, who chairs the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion, made early promises that both a market structure bill and a stablecoin bill would be the first two pieces of legislation he would pass as chair. Market structure legislation would presumably determine whether cryptocurrencies are securities or commodities, while stablecoin legislation would set requirements for the amount and types of collateral that companies issuing such coins must keep in reserve.¬†\n\nDemocrats and Republicans came close to reaching a compromise on stablecoin legislation in the House Financial Services Committee this year, while the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which Hill co-wrote, passed with bipartisan support in the House but stalled in the Senate. The odds of either type of crypto legislation passing this session fell after Republicans gained seats in both chambers of Congress in the November election and some key GOP figures decided it would be better to wait to pass legislation requiring fewer compromises with Democrats next year.\n\nRead More: Rep. French Hill Says He'd Investigate Operation Choke Point 2.0 as Financial Services Chair\n\nIn a letter circulated in November, Hill also promised to investigate how financial regulators were limiting the crypto industry‚Äôs ability to access banking services, a policy critics dubbed ‚ÄúOperation Choke Point 2.0.‚Äù Hill is known to be one of the more informed members of Congress on the technical aspects of cryptocurrency and the business models used, with strong connections to industry groups, business executives, and lobbyists. As a result, while both Hill and Barr are considered to be supportive of crypto, crypto policy advocates found Hill somewhat preferable.¬†\n\nThough there are politicians on both sides of the aisle eager to pass crypto legislation, it is expected that doing so will be easier under a Republican-controlled House and Senate given broader support for the industry in the GOP and a general orientation towards light-touch regulation. That said, Republicans will need at least six Democratic votes in the Senate to pass legislation, and may have chosen Hill for his ability to reach across the aisle, something he was better known for doing than Barr.\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nWho Will Be Trump‚Äôs CFTC Chair?

At the time of writing, the original crypto asset was trading roughly 7% below that level, at $96,527.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has said he would create a strategic bitcoin reserve and end what has been dubbed \"Operation Choke Point 2.0,\" an allegedly coordinated effort by the Biden administration to cut the crypto industry off from the U.S. banking sector.\n\nMagic Eden‚Äôs Native Token Debut Sputters\n\nSolana-based NFT marketplace Magic Eden launched its ecosystem token, ME, on Tuesday, but some users reported being unable to access its airdrop.\n\nAlthough ME's fully diluted valuation reached $15 billion during the first few minutes of trading, its value quickly dropped to around $6 billion, according to data from decentralized exchange and blockchain network data firm DEXScreener.\n\nSocial media was peppered with complaints from users, some reporting that the website was down during the claiming process and others saying they had experienced problems with the mobile app.\n\nME has a total supply of 1 billion tokens, of which 12.5% was designated for the airdrop, 37.7% set aside for community incentives, and the remaining 49.8% allocated to contributors and strategic participants.\n\nSolana‚Äôs Biggest DEX Overtakes Uniswap Trading Volume\n\nRaydium, the largest decentralized exchange running on the Solana blockchain, outpaced Uniswap‚Äôs trading volume during the previous two calendar months.\n\nAfter Raydium became the No. 1 DEX by volume across all chains in October, its November trading volume exceeded Uniswap‚Äôs by around 30%, reaching a total of $124.6 billion, according to data from crypto economy research firm Messari.\n\nAs expected, memecoin trading activity accounted for 65% of that volume.\n\n‚ÄúRaydium's growth also reflects the broader trend of Solana‚Äôs daily DEX volume surpassing Ethereum‚Äôs,‚Äù Messari analyst Matt Kreiser wrote.\n\n‚ÄúIn November, Solana had a nearly 50% share of monthly DEX volume across all chains, 175% more than Ethereum‚Äôs roughly 18% share,‚Äù he said.\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

Young, Veronica Irwin and Tikta\nFreeze Satoshi‚Äôs Bitcoins, Says Avalanche Founder\n\nEmin G√ºn Sirer, co-creator of the Avalanche blockchain and CEO of Ava Labs, the company overseeing its development, has a controversial suggestion for members of the Bitcoin community: Freeze Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs coins.\n\nSirer made his comments in specific regard to advances in quantum computing that could potentially open a window of opportunity for attackers if they gain access to the technology.\n\n‚ÄúSatoshi's early minded [sic] coins used the very old Pay-To-Public-Key (P2PK) format, which reveals the public key and gives the attacker time to grind, for the mother of all cryptography bounties,‚Äù Sirer said in an X post, referring to the 1.1 million BTC sitting in Satoshi‚Äôs multiple wallets.\n\n‚ÄúSo, as [quantum computing] gets threatening, Bitcoin community might want to look into freezing Satoshi's coins, or more generally, provide a sunset date and freeze all coins at P2PK [unspent transaction outputs].‚Äù\n\nSirer‚Äôs remarks come after Google unveiled a new quantum computing chip named Willow that takes just five minutes to complete tasks that would take some of the world‚Äôs most sophisticated computers up to 10 septillion, or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, years.\n\nBitcoin May Have Dipped to $97K but Bullish Signs Persist\n\nEven though Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $103,000 last week and has since sunk to as low as $94,355 in the past 24 hours, U.S. interest in BTC remains strong.\n\nOn Monday, Microstrategy co-founder Michael Saylor announced that the software development firm had not only sold an aggregate of 5,418,449 shares between Dec. 2 and Dec. 8 for roughly $2.1 billion, but had also picked up an additional 21,550 BTC worth $2.1 billion.\n\nNew Top Contender for CFTC Chair Emerges\n\nNow that president-elect Donald Trump has announced his pick of Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, and David Sacks as his A.I. and crypto czar, the last major nomination that could have a big impact on crypto is Trump‚Äôs choice for the chairmanship of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nHardly anybody is willing to make a call on when Trump‚Äôs choice of candidate may be announced, and there isn‚Äôt a particularly strong consensus on who the top contenders are. However, some candidates‚Äô names are generating chatter in lobbying and policy circles, mostly former and current commissioners and staff of the agency.\n\nIn fact, one name that was previously discounted has now become a top contender.\n\n$1.7B Liquidated From Crypto Markets\n\nThe past few weeks have seen a series of cascading liquidations as bitcoin struggles to maintain support above the $100,000 mark.\n\nData from crypto futures trading and information platform CoinGlass show that around $1.72 billion was liquidated across crypto markets as bitcoin dropped to an intraday low of $94,355 during the 24 hours before press time. More than 90% of all liquidations over the period were from long positions alone.\n\nBitcoin has since recovered to trade above $97,900, but altcoins ‚Äî which saw a much steeper selloff ‚Äî are yet to recover. Ether was down 5% on the day, while XRP was trading 11% lower and SOL was down 6.4%.\n\nThe scale of the negative altcoin price action was shown by the fact that $568 million worth of liquidations came from low market-cap altcoins.\n\nCoinbase Tells ‚ÄòRestricted‚Äô Users It Isn‚Äôt Ignoring Them\n\nCrypto exchange Coinbase has attempted to set the record straight after reports that it had been restricting certain customer accounts.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen a surge of new users and old users re-activating their accounts post-[U.S. presidential] election,‚Äù Coinbase said in a statement on X. ‚ÄúAlong with this surge, as is typical with surges, we‚Äôve seen a 2-3x increase in fraudulent attempts.‚Äù\n\nThe exchange said the increase in restricted account numbers had arisen because its fraud prevention systems were working as expected, and it urged users not to believe everything on X.\n\n‚ÄúThat said, if you are restricted, we‚Äôre not ignoring you; we‚Äôre working hard to respond asap,‚Äù the Coinbase team said.\n\nA number of supposed users responded to Coinbase‚Äôs post claiming that their accounts had been restricted for several years and that they had received no help from the team since.\n\n109 Million Onchain Wallets Hold USDT in Q4: Tether\n\nAt the start of the fourth quarter of this year, the number of onchain wallets holding Tether‚Äôs stablecoin, USDT, was more than twice the number of wallets holding Bitcoin, according to Tether.\n\nTether‚Äôs head of economics, Philip Gradwell, noted in the firm‚Äôs latest Insights report that the 109 million onchain wallets holding USDT in Q4 was close to the 128 million wallets holding Ethereum, officially making USDT one of the most widely held digital assets.\n\nGradwell estimates that at least 56 million users who have ever held USDT are likely to reactivate their holdings, adding to the tens of millions of users who hold USDT on centralized platforms.\n\n‚ÄúUSDT continues to dominate the stablecoin market with four times more wallets than all other stablecoins combined,‚Äù he said.\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

I‚Äôm Veronica Irwin, Unchained‚Äôs regulatory reporter.\n\nAlmost immediately after breaking the news about Trump‚Äôs SEC Chair nominee Paul Atkins last week, my editor, the indefatigable Laura Shin, had a request: ‚Äúlet‚Äôs report the hell out of the CFTC.‚Äù¬†\n\nSo that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing ‚Äî or at least, trying to. Admittedly there‚Äôs a lot less chatter about the CFTC Chair than there was SEC, probably because sitting CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam hasn‚Äôt made an enemy out of the crypto industry half as much as SEC Chair Gary Gensler. But the SEC‚Äôs ‚Äúlittle sister‚Äù agency could be more important than the SEC next year, especially if Congress manages to pass market structure legislation as rapidly as some members of Congress have promised to (this is something Eleanor Terrett over at Fox Business has been reporting on a lot lately).¬†\n\nDespite the relative quiet, I‚Äôve been able to cobble together a working list of names, some of which seem more likely than others. It‚Äôs a little fuzzy, so think of it like your CFTC chair status update.\n\nWho Will Be Trump‚Äôs CFTC Chair? There's a New Top Contender for the Role\n\n¬†If cryptocurrencies are declared commodities, the CFTC could have a lot of influence over the industry.\n\nBrian Quintenz is a top contender for CFTC Chair (photo courtesy of Brian Quintenz)\n\nNow that Trump has announced his picks to lead the SEC, Paul Atkins, and his AI and Crypto Czar, David Sacks, the last major nomination that could have a big impact on crypto is Trump‚Äôs choice for CFTC Chair.\n\nThat said, hardly anybody is willing to make a call on when to expect Trump‚Äôs announcement, and there isn‚Äôt a particularly strong consensus on who the top choices are. However, some candidates‚Äô names are picking up steam in the lobbying and policy circles, mostly former and current commissioners and staff of the agency.\n\nThat said, one name was previously discounted but has now become a top contender: former CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz.\n\nAn Uncertain State of Play\n\nIt‚Äôs unclear whether Trump will make his pick in the next few weeks or next few months. Digital Chamber President Cody Carbone explained on the Unchained podcast last week that he did not think the Trump transition team was even close to making a pick, pointing out that the CFTC chair under Trump‚Äôs first term, Chris Giancarlo, wasn‚Äôt nominated until March. While some sources who spoke to Unchained seemed confident about who was on the short list, others were hesitant to even name names.\n\nThat‚Äôs partly because there‚Äôs less sleuthing going on amongst lobbyists and other crypto policy advocates to figure out who the CFTC Chair is at all. Despite the fact that it very well could have significant oversight over crypto if most tokens are declared commodities rather than securities ‚Äî a perspective many expect Atkins to take, and something which could also be encouraged by a market structure bill passed through Congress ‚Äî the CFTC is generally seen as a less powerful agency than the SEC. A SEC Chair nomination, which can impact the stock market, is just not as politically important or exciting as a CFTC Chair. For this reason, not as many powerful securities lawyers and business experts are typically interested in the job, either.\n\nRead More: David Sacks as A.I. & Crypto Czar? Why the Industry Was Surprised\n\nFor what it's worth, the sources closest to the transition team and various other groups vetting candidates, like Project 2025 and the America First Policy Institute, aren‚Äôt aware of any candidates having gone to or been invited to Mar-a-Lago before this week. One, however, says interviews are today and tomorrow.\n\nA New Top Contender: Brian Quintenz\n\nFormer CFTC commissioner Brian Quintenz, who is currently the Head of Policy at a16z crypto, is emerging as a top pick. While many in DC circles had written him off weeks ago as someone uninterested in the job (his current gig is pretty desirable), some reliable sources seem to think he‚Äôs back in the running ‚Äî and if he is, there‚Äôs good reason to think he‚Äôd be an exciting choice to the president-elect.\n\nFor one, he‚Äôs reportedly been advising the Trump transition team on crypto policy for at least the past few weeks. Second, his boss, Marc Andreessen, and Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks run in the same conservative, venture capitalist, Silicon Valley circles (as Andreessen explained on the Joe Rogan podcast two weeks ago), and it‚Äôs fair to assume someone who Andreessen sees as smart and capable would be viewed similarly by Sacks. Of course, his resume also speaks for itself, as a former Trump nominee (who the president-elect had to nominate twice since Trump rescinded the first one) to the commission.\n\nOne factor that might work against him, however: he‚Äôs currently a board member at the prediction market platform Kalshi, which has been at odds with the competitor prediction market, crypto darling and Trump family favorite, Polymarket.\n\nRead More: Polymarket Surpasses $1 Billion in Monthly Trading Volume, Becomes Top Free News App in Apple's App Store\n\nThe Most Discussed Candidate\n\nCFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger is on everybody‚Äôs list. All five experts who were willing to give Unchained a working list of who they believe is in contention said she is a top pick, and even those who weren‚Äôt said she‚Äôd be a reasonable choice, just on the merits of her resume. A former top aide to Senate majority leader John Thune, Mersinger has been a strong defender of crypto while at the commission, and a frequent speaker at crypto policy events.\n\nA known quantity amongst the other commissioners and CFTC staff, Mersinger is reliably conservative but reasonable, and would have a relatively easy time leading the charge for the CFTC to write rules of the road for crypto compared to some other more controversial picks. Also, because she‚Äôs already a commissioner, she wouldn‚Äôt need to go through the Senate confirmation process ‚Äî Trump could unilaterally make the decision to elevate her to chair.\n\nSources in Disagreement Over These Candidates\n\nThen, there‚Äôs two names to which sources have very, very mixed reads. The first is Commissioner Caroline Pham, also a reliable crypto advocate who often shares similar perspectives on the technology to Mersinger. One source close to both the CFTC and people who have Trump‚Äôs ear on such matters insisted she was a candidate for the same reasons as Mersinger, while two others insisted she was definitively not being considered. (Others just said they hadn‚Äôt heard her name). Sources who understood her to not be a contender weren‚Äôt sure why, but one more neutral source suggested it could have something to do with the optics of photos she posted on X of her with Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nOthers active in crypto policy issues disagree about the photo, however. ‚ÄúThe photo is a non issue because at the moment when the picture was taken, he was taking pictures with everyone,‚Äù said MoonPay enterprise president Keith Grossman, who says he believes that Pham is being considered citing industry conversations. ‚ÄúIf you told me she was at a Diddy party, I would be more concerned.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAny insinuation that a photo that she took during her first week on the job with a figure who was also pictured with half of Washington somehow overshadows her work to foster American dominance in the crypto space is silly,‚Äù said a source familiar with the discussions.\n\nThen there‚Äôs Digital Chamber Founder and CEO Perianne Boring, who was named as a top candidate in a Fox Business story last week which made waves through the crypto industry. The article makes a strong argument for Boring, highlighting her crypto expertise and work as a TV anchor, which, in context of reports that say Trump cares very much about how his nominees appear on television, is relevant.\n\nHowever, three sources who spoke to Unchained vehemently denied the claims, arguing that her candidacy was a rumor started by the Chamber itself in order to raise her profile. The debate over the likelihood of Boring being a contender is extremely heated, broadly prompting uncharacteristically snarky reactions and hot takes. ‚ÄúPerianne is CFTC Chair. And I am Satoshi Nakamoto,‚Äù one source close to the transition team quipped sarcastically.\n\nThe Rest of the Pack\n\nSome other former CFTC officials who are potential candidates are former commissioner Jill Sommers, former director of the market participants division Josh Sterling, and former attorney in the Office of the General Counsel Neal Kumar.\n\nKumar is particularly interesting as a former Democrat who, judging by his political donation history on Open Secrets, donates to politicians on both sides of the aisle, including Trump.\n\nSommers and Sterling, meanwhile, are consistently conservative. Sommers, notably, is now the chair of the derivatives practice at Potomak, Atkins‚Äô consulting firm. Each is a name that sources have heard tossed around as qualified candidates who would also be interested in the position, but no sources who spoke to Unchained are convinced they‚Äôre top contenders at this stage.\n\nRead More: Crypto Industry Braces for a Wave of SEC, CFTC Actions as Fiscal Year Draws to a Close\n\nQuintenz, Mersinger, Pham and Kumar declined requests for comment. The other contenders did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nTrump Taps Paul Atkins for Next SEC Chair, Making Good on His Crypto Promises\n\nDavid Sacks as A.I. & Crypto Czar?

Young and Tikta\nU.S. Bitcoin ETFs Overtake Satoshi‚Äôs BTC Holdings\n\nSpot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the United States now collectively hold more BTC than any individual, company or government in the world, including the blockchain‚Äôs pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto, according to data shared by Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas.\n\nAmerican ETFs hold 1,104,534 million BTC, outgunning Satoshi‚Äôs 1,100,000 million BTC, Balchunas said.\n\nSatoshi‚Äôs bitcoin stash is spread across some 20,000 wallet addresses and has remained untouched, except for a few early test transactions.\n\nBitcoin ETFs in the U.S., by contrast, have been on a steady BTC accumulation spree since their launch in January.\n\nU.S.-listed ETFs bought 28,600 BTC last week alone, far exceeding the 3,150 BTC that was mined, according to data from Bitcoin investment firm HODL15Capital.\n\nWarren Gets a Say on SEC Commissioner Picks\n\nDemocratic party leadership is giving Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren significant sway to choose who will fill open slots for Democratic commissioners at the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to three sources familiar with discussions inside the party.\n\nThe SEC can include up to three commissioners from the same party. Currently, two of the Democrats on the commission are Chair Gary Gensler and Commissioner Jaime Liz√°rraga, both of whom are stepping down in January.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has already nominated Republican Paul Atkins to replace Gensler. The remaining two commissioners must therefore be Democrats, independents, or members of a third party, rather than Republicans.\n\nDavid Sacks as A.I. & Crypto Czar? Why the Industry Was Surprised\n\nDonald Trump‚Äôs announcement that investor and podcaster David Sacks would serve as the White House‚Äôs A.I. and crypto czar shocked the industry, which had expected a role dedicated to crypto alone at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nAccording to the announcement, Sacks will lead a Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, implying that Trump has also modified plans for the dedicated crypto advisory council promised at the Bitcoin 2024 conference this summer to include other tech sectors.\n\nSources active in crypto policy circles who spoke to Unchained on condition of anonymity expressed surprise, many having thought that Trump was still undecided as to whether to name a crypto czar at all.\n\nRadiant Capital Says North Koreans Were Behind $50M Hack\n\nDecentralized finance protocol Radiant Capital says an Oct. 16 incident that resulted in $50 million worth of crypto being stolen from the platform was carried out by a North Korea-linked threat actor.\n\nRadiant said it had ‚Äúhigh confidence‚Äù in its conclusion as regards the origin of the attack, posting that a Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea-aligned individual had impersonated a former contractor and sent a malicious zipped PDF to one of its developers.\n\nThe ZIP file reportedly carried sophisticated malware ‚Äî believed to be North Korea‚Äôs AppleJesus crypto malware ‚Äî that was used to establish a macOS back door.\n\nRadiant DAO said its team was working with law enforcement and security agencies to recover the stolen funds.\n\nSushi Labs CEO Explains ‚ÄòOff-Brand‚Äô Product Announcements\n\nSushi Labs CEO Jared Grey laid out the protocol‚Äôs ‚Äúambitious 2025 plans‚Äù in a post on X over the weekend.\n\nThose plans include a Solana-based trading platform named Wara, a onchain order book perpetual DEX dubbed Susa, a perpetual contract product called Kubo, a maximal extractable value eliminator named Blade, and a scaling up of its SushiSwap aggregator.\n\nGrey explained that while some of the product announcements might appear ‚Äúoff-brand‚Äù for Sushi, franchising the brand and product stack into new ecosystems would help expand its reach beyond its ethereum virtual machine roots.\n\nGrey last week proposed diversifying the DAO‚Äôs treasury by reallocating 70% to stablecoins, 20% to blue-chip crypto tokens, and 10% other DeFi tokens.\n\nJustin Sun Sends $120M ETH to HTX as Price Hits $4,000\n\nTron founder Justin Sun sent a massive $119.7 million worth of ether to crypto exchange HTX over the weekend, according to data from blockchain wallet tracker Spot On Chain.\n\nSun, who has become a controversial figure even beyond the crypto community ‚Äî not least due to being prosecuted for alleged fraud by the SEC and his effective gifting of $15 million to president-elect Donald Trump through a major purchase of tokens from a Trump-backed crypto venture ‚Äî reportedly made the transfers after the price of ether surpassed $4,000, its highest level in a year.\n\nSpot On Chain noted that the ETH Sun transferred was part of the $1.1 billion of ETH he acquired between February and August.\n\nSince Sun‚Äôs average cost basis is an estimated $3,027 per coin, his total profits stand at $366 million.\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

But what about the other Tornado Cash lawsuits?\n\nLast week, the crypto world celebrated a major legal victory when a federal appeals court struck down OFAC‚Äôs sanctions on Tornado Cash‚Äôs immutable smart contracts in a Coinbase-funded lawsuit. While this decision is a significant win for crypto, its implications go far beyond the industry‚Äîit challenges the very limits of U.S. sanctions authority on open-source code.\n\nIn this episode, Coinbase‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal and VP of Legal Leah Bressack discuss the case, the reasoning behind the court‚Äôs decision, and its broader implications, especially given that other cases are still in court. They address whether they think the government will appeal, how this ruling impacts other privacy tools and the other lawsuits, and why the case is a critical precedent for the intersection of code, law, and innovation.\n\nPlus, what does this mean for Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm?\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nWhy Trump‚Äôs SEC Chair Pick, Paul Atkins, Is So Positive for Crypto\n\nTrump‚Äôs SEC Chair nominee is a fan of crypto and not of regulation by enforcement. But could he be hamstrung by recent permanent moves by Gary Gensler?\n\nWith the nomination of the pro-crypto Paul Atkins to be the next SEC chair, the crypto industry is potentially facing a 180 from the agency. As co-chair of the Digital Chamber‚Äôs Token Alliance initiative and a board member of Securitize, Atkins is not only pro-crypto, but also against the type of ‚Äúregulation by enforcement‚Äù strategy of current Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nIn this episode, Cody Carbone, president at The Digital Chamber, explains why Atkins is likely to start reassessment of the agency‚Äôs lawsuits against crypto firms, why Trump might break with protocol to fill one of the commissioner seats that would typically be filled by a Democrat, and who he thinks might make for a good ‚Äúcrypto czar.‚Äù\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nBits + Bips: Why XRP Might Have Been The ‚ÄòMost Hated‚Äô Rally Ever\n\nThe panel dives into the impact of the Treasury Secretary pick, the XRP rally, and ETH/BTC dynamics. Also, who should be Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúcrypto czar‚Äù?\n\nIn this episode of Bits + Bips, hosts James Seyffart, Noelle Acheson, and Ram Ahluwalia are joined by Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, to discuss the surprising mainstream buzz around XRP‚Äôs latest rally, dubbed the ‚Äúmost hated rally in crypto.‚Äù\n\nThey also analyze the new Treasury Secretary‚Äôs ambitious economic plan and what it could mean for inflation, fiscal discipline, and market stability. Meanwhile, Ethereum struggles to reclaim its narrative as the go-to blockchain, even as its ETH/BTC ratio shows signs of life.\n\nAnd in a moment that captures the personal side of crypto‚Äôs rise, the team reflects on Thanksgiving table conversations, where bitcoin and digital assets became unexpected stars.\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nOn Unregulated:\nIs the Appointment of David Sacks a Win for Crypto? ü§î\nVERONICA IRWIN\n¬∑\n6 DECEMBER 2024\nRead full story\nüè¶ It's Official: Trump Announces Paul Atkins as Pick for SEC Chair üéâ\nVERONICA IRWIN\n¬∑\n5 DECEMBER 2024\nRead full story\nüè¶ SCOOP: Trump Taps Next SEC Chair üéâ\nVERONICA IRWIN\n¬∑\n3 DECEMBER 2024\nRead full story\nIn Case You Missed It üëÄ\n\nHere are some articles you will probably want to read:\n\nThis GIGA Influencer Was Charged by the SEC for Defrauding Investors\n\nOn Wednesday, Coinbase added the GIGA memecoin to its listings roadmap, causing the price to surge 50%.

    "content": "Discover more from Unchained\nYour no-hype resource for all things crypto\nOver 17,000 subscribers\nBy subscribing, I agree to Substack's Terms of Use, and acknowledge its Information Collection Notice and Privacy Policy.\nSubscribe\nContinue reading\nSign in\nTRADGOV (PREVIOUSLY UNREGULATED)\nWarren Could Pick Democratic SEC Commissioners üò±\nProtocol would be for Democratic leadership to choose.\nVERONICA IRWIN\nDEC 07, 2024\n2\nShare\n\nHey! I‚Äôm Veronica Irwin, Unchained‚Äôs regulatory reporter.\n\nThere is no rose without a thorn, so they say. And on the cusp of some really good-for-crypto SEC news, I bring you some bad.¬†\n\nGood: Trump has nominated a pro-crypto SEC chair, Paul Atkins.¬†\n\nBad: Crypto-critic Elizabeth Warren might end up picking a Democratic commissioner.\n\nWarren Will Have Significant Say in Selecting the Democratic SEC Commissioner\n\nSchumer is asking for the input from the Senate‚Äôs chief crypto critic.\n\nWarren is the Senate's biggest crypto critic (Shutterstock)\n\nDemocratic party leadership is giving Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren significant sway to choose who will fill the open slot for a Democratic commissioner at the SEC, according to three sources familiar with discussions inside the Democratic party.¬†\n\nThe SEC can only have up to three commissioners from the same party. Currently, two of the Democrats on the commission include Chair Gary Gensler and Commissioner Jaime Liz√°rraga, who are both stepping down in January. Trump has already nominated Republican Paul Atkins as next SEC Chair to replace Gensler. The remaining two commissioners must therefore be Democrats, independents, or members of a third party, rather than Republicans.¬†\n\nThe Senate Banking Committee will meet next Wednesday to decide whether or not to put forth Democratic Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw for re-confirmation, according to Fox Business, potentially filling one of those slots. Afterwards, there will still be at least one Democratic commissioner spot available.¬†\n\nWarren‚Äôs power in the Democratic SEC commissioner selection process is the product of complex political horse trading, explained below. The result is that Warren‚Äôs lasting power in the Democratic party, and in SEC oversight, could ultimately hurt crypto. Warren is the harshest critic of crypto in the Senate, and has advocated for stringent regulation of the industry in the name of consumer protection and national security. In 2022, Warren was reportedly working on a bill which would have made most cryptocurrency tokens securities and handed oversight of crypto to the SEC, though a bill ultimately introduced in 2023 focused on money laundering and split the SEC‚Äôs crypto responsibilities with the CFTC. The bill never passed the Senate.¬†\n\nAs Democratic Minority leader next session, Chuck Schumer typically gets to pick. But by giving the power to Warren, he‚Äôs testing whether she can come up with someone moderate enough to be confirmed by a Republican-majority Senate.¬†\n\nRead More: Democratic SEC Commissioner Is Stepping Down, but That Doesn‚Äôt Mean Trump Will Get 2 Outright Picks\n\nCommissioner Selection Protocol\n\nProcedurally, the president nominates SEC commissioners, which are subsequently confirmed by the Senate. In situations when open spots on the commission cannot be filled by members of the President‚Äôs party or of the Senate majority party, the Senate minority leader typically recommends commissioners. Oftentimes SEC commissioners of opposing parties are nominated as a pair (one Democrat and one Republican) under the expectation that Senators of either party will confirm the opposite party‚Äôs nominees.¬†\n\nIf this procedure is followed next year, as five legal and policy experts told Unchained they expect it will be, the process would go like this:¬†\n\nTrump informs the Senate he intends to nominate a Republican to the commission (he already did this on Wednesday when he announced that he would nominate Paul Atkins as chair).¬†\n\nSchumer tells Trump which Democrats he would like to see appointed to the commission to replace the Democrats who are leaving.¬†\n\nSchumer and Trump, and majority leader John Thune make an agreement that Trump will make sure Republicans will confirm the Democratic nominee(s) in exchange for Democrats confirming Trump‚Äôs Republican nominee.¬†\n\nEach of the nominees are confirmed by the Senate with the required 51 votes.\n\nIt is, of course, possible that Trump would forgo the historically followed protocol entirely, and pick commissioners to replace Gensler, Liz√°rraga, or Crenshaw without Democratic party input. There is no law requiring him to take recommendations from Schumer, and, as Digital Chamber President Cody Carbone explained on Unchained, Trump could appoint other commissioners he was considering for SEC Chair as independents.\n\nRead More: Andy Barr‚Äôs Pitch for Financial Services Committee Chair Reaffirms Support for Crypto\n\nHowever, the Senate still goes by consensus, and some Republican Senators are already frustrated with Trump‚Äôs threats to bypass their power via recess appointments, according to reports. Thus, sources who explained the dynamic to Unchained say that it is unlikely Trump will expend his political capital fighting to bypass Democrats‚Äô input on SEC commissioners.\n\nSchumer‚Äôs Political Calculation to Give Warren Say\n\nThree sources familiar with internal Democratic party machinations say that Schumer is taking recommendations from Warren on which Democrats to recommend to Trump as commissioners. The reasons why are a blend of seniority and politics.¬†\n\nOn one hand, as a senior Senator in the Democratic party, Elizabeth Warren has accrued a significant amount of political capital amongst her peers. Over the years Warren has become a successful fundraiser, has earned the support of left-leaning think tanks and nonprofits, and a dedicated group of Democratic voters, many of whom became fans of her when she ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. She commands a certain amount of power amongst some of the most left-wing and established members of the Democratic party, and has been known to pressure more moderate members, like Schumer, to take a harsher stance on crypto. Even though money from the crypto industry, primarily via the political action committee Fairshake, cost Democrats several elections in key swing states, Warren has been denying any responsibility for giving the party an anti-crypto reputation, three sources explained. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt think she did anything wrong,‚Äù one source active in Democratic fundraising explained. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of Harvard arrogance there.‚Äù¬†\n\nRead More: Rep. French Hill Says He‚Äôd Investigate Operation Choke Point 2.0 as Financial Services Chair\n\nIronically, that money from the crypto industry also gave Warren more power within the party. Fairshake donated over $40 million to unseat Democratic Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, helping to elect Republican Senator Bernie Moreno in his place. After his defeat, Brown vacated the position of Chair of the Senate Banking Committee, which is responsible for SEC oversight, and Elizabeth Warren took his spot as the most senior Democratic member of the committee. Two sources explained that as Ranking Member, Warren is the ideological leader for Senators on banking, finance, and crypto issues, and Senators for whom these issues aren‚Äôt a priority take cues from her on how to vote.¬†\n\nOne of those sources, as well as an additional involved in Democratic policy conversations on crypto, said Schumer, frustrated with Warren‚Äôs anti-crypto stance, is also allowing her to have a say over the Democratic SEC commissioner selection process as a political test.¬†\n\nBecause Senators are unlikely to confirm a progressive SEC commissioner, these two sources say, Schumer is challenging Warren to choose someone more moderate. In effect, Schumer, a moderate, is wrestling with Warren, a progressive, to cooperate.If she won‚Äôt pick someone more moderate, Schumer is betting Warren will fail, one of these sources explained. ‚ÄúHe can say ‚ÄòElizabeth we tried it your way and it didn‚Äôt work; now we do it my way,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúWarren is a problem for the caucus on a lot of things. It‚Äôs clear her views aren‚Äôt popular and make people angry.‚Äù¬†\n\nRepresentatives for Schumer and Warren did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nTrump Taps Paul Atkins for Next SEC Chair, Making Good on His Crypto Promises\n\nDavid Sacks as A.I. & Crypto Czar?

Earlier in the day on Thursday, sources had questioned whether a ‚Äúcrypto czar‚Äù role would even exist. As of this morning, reactions amongst those speaking with Unchained privately are mixed. Sure, Trump‚Äôs appointment of a crypto and A.I. czar demonstrates more support for the industry than anything the current administration has done. But it‚Äôs also not quite the dedicated ‚Äúcrypto advisory council‚Äù people had been expecting and frankly, people seem shocked.¬†\n\nPublicly, however, the industry is already kissing the ring.¬†\n\nDavid Sacks as A.I. & Crypto Czar? Why the Industry Was Surprised\n\nIndustry sources speaking to Unchained had been expecting a White House staff role or advisory council dedicated to crypto alone.\n\nDavid Sacks is a member of the \"PayPal Mafia,\" which also includes Elon Musk. (Craft Ventures)\n\nDonald Trump‚Äôs announcement on Truth Social Thursday night that investor and podcaster David Sacks would serve as the White House A.I. and Crypto Czar shocked the industry, which had expected a White House role dedicated to crypto alone. According to the announcement, Sacks will lead a Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology, implying that Trump has also modified plans for the dedicated crypto advisory council promised at the Bitcoin 2024 conference this summer to include other tech industry sectors.¬†\n\n‚ÄúDavid will guide policy for the Administration in Artificial Intelligence and Cryptocurrency, two areas critical to the future of American competitiveness,‚Äù the Truth Social post read. ‚ÄúHe will safeguard Free Speech online, and steer us away from Big Tech bias and censorship. He will work on a legal framework so the Crypto industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the U.S.‚Äù¬†\n\nRead More: A Degen Administration? Why the Crypto Czar May Be Allowed to Own Tokens\n\nSources active in crypto policy circles who spoke to Unchained under the condition of anonymity expressed surprise, many having thought that Trump was still undecided as to whether to have a crypto czar at all. However, many reacted positively on social media, arguing that by combining the topics of crypto and AI, Trump has given a gift to the crypto industry. ‚ÄúCrypto is elevated to a crazy degree with an AI pairing under an alpha dog of tech,‚Äù said Messari founder Ryan Selkis on X. ‚ÄúDavid Sacks‚Äô unparalleled track record as an entrepreneur, investor, and innovator makes him uniquely suited to lead U.S. crypto policy at a pivotal moment in the industry‚Äôs evolution,‚Äù Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith said in a statement.¬†\n\nFrom PayPal Mafia to Crypto Supporter\n\nDavid Sacks is the co-founder of the early-stage Venture Capital firm Craft Ventures and was an early employee at Confinity, which later became PayPal. Because of his prescient work in the fintech sector, Sacks has become a prominent voice in Silicon Valley. Close friends with other members of PayPal‚Äôs founding team such as serial entrepreneur Elon Musk and venture capital investor Peter Thiel, Sacks has for several years exerted influence over tech industry political thinking and has climbed the ladder in right wing political circles more broadly.¬†\n\nSacks has also expanded his public profile as a co-host of the ‚ÄúAll-In‚Äù podcast, in which he and other Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis, and David Friedberg discuss various tech, social, and political topics. All-in is the 226th most popular podcast on Apple Podcasts generally, according to Chartable, and the third most popular technology podcast, demonstrating its outsized popularity in the tech industry specifically. Trump surrounded himself with tech investors and entrepreneurs as he shaped his campaign.\n\nRead More: Trump Taps Paul Atkins for Next SEC Chair, Making Good on His Crypto Promises\n\nOn the podcast, Sacks often serves as a defender of Donald Trump and GOP ideas, and has been generally supportive of crypto. For example, Sacks described the mixed court ruling that XRP was not a security when sold on a public exchange, but was a security when sold to institutional investors, as a win for the crypto industry as a whole.¬†\n\nHe has been called a ‚ÄúSolana Bull,‚Äù having invested in early Solana investors Multicoin Capital in 2018 and having said on All-In in 2023 that he did not sell SOL after the collapse of FTX. His firm, Craft Ventures, has invested in crypto firms BitGo and Bitwise. However, Sacks is not broadly considered a crypto-focused investor or entrepreneur and is not an active participant in crypto policy circles or the crypto conference circuit.\n\nThe Crypto Industry‚Äôs Mixed Reactions¬†\n\nAs of Thursday morning, sources working in crypto policy who spoke to Unchained thought an announcement of a crypto czar or an advisory council was weeks away, questioning whether the roles would exist and whether they would be White House staff roles or more ceremonial in nature and tangential to the administration.¬†\n\nThey had for several weeks considered candidates for either position to be large donors working in the crypto industry who had met with Trump at various crypto and tech roundtables over the past several months. Names that have been floated for crypto czar or advisory council roles include Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Brian Armstrong, or executives from bitcoin mining firms like Riot Platforms.¬†\n\nThe broad understanding was that either a czar or advisory council would be dedicated to crypto, and Trump‚Äôs combination of crypto with other tech topics like AI in his announcement came as a surprise.¬†\n\nRead More: Trump Taps Hedge Fund Manager Scott Bessent to Be Treasury Secretary\n\nFox Business had reported that former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo, affectionately nicknamed¬† ‚ÄúCrypto Dad‚Äù by the industry, was a finalist for the crypto czar position, though some sources who spoke to Unchained were skeptical that he was a real contender and surmised the widespread rumors were only a product of his own jockeying for the position.¬†\n\nTwo sources had also suggested to Unchained shortly after the election that Blockchain Association Director of Government Relations Ron Hammond, though his name had not been raised as a serious candidate in interviews since. It is unclear how seriously any alternatives to Sacks were formally vetted by the Trump-Vance transition team.¬†\n\nBut Can Sacks Own Crypto?¬†\n\nUnchained first reported that a White House staff role specializing in crypto was being considered, but that an Office of Government Ethics (OGE) rule prohibiting senior staff from owning crypto had complicated the process. The rule is technically a ‚Äúlegal advisory‚Äù ruling, meaning that though it is not itself a law passed by Congress it is meant to have the effect of law for official staff.¬†\n\nSacks‚Äô appointment raises questions about whether the role is possibly a non-government advisor position, which would exempt him from the rule, whether the Trump administration plans to somehow change or bypass the rule, or whether it would appoint a new Director to the OGE who would change the rule. A Craft spokesperson told Axios the role was ‚Äúadvisory,‚Äù like the Department of Government Ethics, and would thus not require Sacks to leave Craft.¬†\n\nLeadership for The Digital Chamber, which published a letter addressed to OGE Acting Director Shelley Finlayson requesting the OGE rule be reconsidered, did not respond to immediate requests for comment, but told Unchained on November 21 that they had not received a reply.¬†\n\nSpokespeople for the Trump-Vance transition team and Craft Ventures did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Chris Giancarlo also did not respond to a request for comment.¬†\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nTrump Taps Paul Atkins for Next SEC Chair, Making Good on His Crypto Promises\n\nAndy Barr‚Äôs Pitch for Financial Services Committee Chair Reaffirms Support for Crypto\n\nRep.

But could he be hamstrung by recent permanent moves by Gary Gensler?\n\nWith the nomination of the pro-crypto Paul Atkins to be the next SEC chair, the crypto industry is potentially facing a 180 from the agency. As co-chair of the Digital Chamber‚Äôs Token Alliance initiative and a board member of Securitize, Atkins is not only pro-crypto, but also against the type of ‚Äúregulation by enforcement‚Äù strategy of current Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nIn this episode, Cody Carbone, president at The Digital Chamber, explains why Atkins is likely to start reassessment of the agency‚Äôs lawsuits against crypto firms, why Trump might break with protocol to fill one of the commissioner seats that would typically be filled by a Democrat, and who he thinks might make for a good ‚Äúcrypto czar.‚Äù\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nWeekly News Recap\nBitcoin Hits Historic $100,000 Mark\n\nBitcoin surged past the $100,000 milestone on Wednesday, a historic achievement that cements its role in the financial landscape. The cryptocurrency has soared over 40% since Election Day, driven by institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and growing enthusiasm amongst global leaders.\n\nThe landmark price was reached shortly after significant comments from influential figures. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell called bitcoin ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù underscoring its value as a store of wealth. Russian President Vladimir Putin praised bitcoin‚Äôs resistance to sanctions, calling it a viable alternative in the global economy. Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Eric Adams highlighted his personal gains from bitcoin‚Äôs rise, reiterating his pro-crypto stance.\n\nTo all those who‚Äôve been ‚ÄúHodling‚Äù‚Ä¶ congratulations!\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\nA Martial Law Declaration Triggers Crypto Market Chaos in South Korea and Flips Kimchi Premium\n\nDespite bitcoin‚Äôs market rally, in South Korea bitcoin and other cryptoassets plummeted on South Korean exchanges after President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law during a political crisis. Bitcoin briefly traded at $61,200 on South Korean crypto exchange Upbit, a 33% drop compared to its $95,000 price on global exchanges Coinbase and Binance. XRP and ether also suffered significant declines, with XRP losing more than half its value.\n\nThe market upheaval created a rare arbitrage opportunity. Historically, South Korea‚Äôs \"kimchi premium\" saw crypto prices higher locally due to strong demand and capital controls. On Tuesday, this reversed as investors dumped local assets. By late afternoon, the gap narrowed, with bitcoin, ether, and XRP trading at a modest 2-3% discount.\n\nThe crisis subsided quickly, with the National Assembly nullifying the martial law declaration.\n\nPhoto by engin akyurt on Unsplash\nSEC-Charged Influencer Behind the GIGA Memecoin Sparks Controversy\n\nJoshua Goltry, a self-proclaimed \"whale\" of the GIGA memecoin, has drawn scrutiny after Unchained revealed his history of defrauding investors. Goltry, known online as @NotChaseColeman, settled a $3 million fraud case with the SEC in 2024, which led to his ban from the securities industry. Despite this, he has become a prominent voice in the GIGA community, promoting the token to his 50,000 followers on X.\n\nGIGA surged 50% after Coinbase added it to its listings roadmap, reaching a $477 million market cap. However, Unchained reported signs of token concentration among top wallets, raising concerns about market manipulation.\n\nGoltry dismissed connections between his SEC case and GIGA, stating, \"I started a new beginning in a project I really believe in.\" Yet skepticism persists as questions about his influence and GIGA's transparency mount.\n\nJosh Goltry, who, in October, had told multiple people he was a whale for the $477 million GIGA memecoin, settled a fraud case with the SEC. (BFA)\nFormer Celsius CEO Pleads Guilty\n\nAlex Mashinsky, the former CEO of defunct crypto lender Celsius, has pleaded guilty to two criminal charges ‚Äî commodities fraud and securities fraud ‚Äî in a New York court. The maximum prison sentence he faces for these two counts is 30 years and his sentencing is scheduled for April next year. The seven charges brought against Mashinsky included fraud, conspiracy, and orchestrating a scheme to manipulate the price of Celsius‚Äô native token, CEL.\n\nMashinsky, 59, was arrested in 2023 following allegations that he misled customers about Celsius‚Äô financial health and profitability. The crypto lending platform, which allowed users to earn interest and take out loans against digital assets, filed for bankruptcy in 2022 amid financial turmoil within the crypto industry.\n\nProsecutors from the Southern District of New York accused Mashinsky of making false public statements to entice customers to deposit funds into Celsius. The SEC has also charged him with conducting fraudulent and unregistered sales of crypto securities, further intensifying legal scrutiny.\n\nMarc Andreessen Spotlights ‚ÄòOperation Chokepoint 2.0‚Äô\n\nAppearing on The Joe Rogan Experience, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, accused the Biden administration of reviving a 2013 initiative known as \"Operation Chokepoint\" to target crypto startups, something the crypto community has been calling out for years. Andreessen claimed over 30 tech founders were \"debanked\" in the last four years, a practice he described as a deliberate effort to financially isolate crypto entrepreneurs. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no due process‚Ä¶ no appeal,‚Äù he said, echoing concerns about systemic exclusion.\n\nElon Musk amplified the issue, sparking widespread discussion. Crypto leaders such as Coinbase‚Äôs CEO Brian Armstrong labeled it ‚Äúunethical,‚Äù while Custodia Bank‚Äôs Caitlin Long and Gemini‚Äôs Tyler Winklevoss shared their own debanking experiences, underscoring the industry's struggles with maintaining basic financial services.\n\nThe controversy draws parallels to Libra, Facebook‚Äôs ill-fated stablecoin project, later rebranded as Diem. David Marcus, its former leader, recently called its demise a ‚Äúpolitical kill.‚Äù Despite adapting to regulatory demands, Marcus alleged that pressure from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other officials crushed Libra‚Äôs ambitions, demonstrating the political hurdles faced by crypto innovators.\n\nGrayscale Joins the Solana ETF Race\n\nGrayscale has filed to convert its Solana Trust (GSOL) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF), becoming the fifth asset manager to pursue a Solana ETF this year. Initially launched in 2021 as a closed-end fund, the Solana Trust currently manages $134 million in assets. The move aligns with Grayscale‚Äôs successful conversions of its Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts into ETFs earlier this year.\n\nThe filing, submitted via NYSE Arca, signals Grayscale‚Äôs intention to list the ETF pending regulatory approval. Solana (SOL), which has surged over 130% year-to-date, saw a 3% price jump following the filing, reflecting heightened investor enthusiasm. If approved, Grayscale will compete with asset managers like Bitwise, VanEck, and Canary Capital in offering Solana ETFs.\n\nPhoto by GuerrillaBuzz on Unsplash\nXRP's Market Cap Surges Past Solana\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt only bitcoin that rose significantly this week. Ripple‚Äôs XRP soared over 40% on Monday, hitting a high of $2.86 on Monday ‚Äî its highest price since January 2018. This meteoric rise pushed XRP‚Äôs market capitalization to $158 billion, overtaking Solana and briefly overtaking Tether (USDT). Once battered by a 2020 SEC lawsuit and subsequent exchange delistings, XRP is now experiencing renewed momentum.\n\nA key driver is growing interest in XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). WisdomTree has filed for an XRP ETF despite the ongoing legal uncertainty surrounding XRP‚Äôs classification as a security, while Bitwise, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Grayscale have also expressed similar ambitions. Meanwhile, decentralized finance (DeFi) enthusiasts are experimenting with XRP‚Äôs blockchain, known as XRP Ledger, despite criticisms of its centralized consensus mechanism.\n\nOn an episode of the Bits + Bips podcast, Alex Thorn, a researcher at investment firm Galaxy, noted the rally‚Äôs divisive nature, saying, ‚Äúthis might be the most hated rally in crypto. OG Bitcoiners and institutional investors all hate XRP, but here it is, tripling in just four days.‚Äù\n\nA Parody Project Revives the Enron Name\n\nA Delaware-based crypto project, calling itself \"Enron,\" is parodying the infamous energy company that collapsed in 2001 after a massive fraud scandal. Unlike the original Houston-based Enron, which collapsed in scandal, the new Delaware-registered venture openly embraces its satirical identity, even explicitly labeling itself as a parody in its official terms of use.\n\nLed by CEO Charles Gaydos, the project offers Enron-branded merchandise, NFTs, and an exchange. Trademark filings also reveal plans for an ‚ÄúEnron Web4‚Äù initiative. In a tongue-in-cheek move, its job board even lists a search for a ‚ÄúNuclear Systems Engineer.‚Äù\n\nMichael Saylor Urges Microsoft to Adopt Bitcoin for $5 Trillion Opportunity\n\nMicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor pitched a bold Bitcoin adoption strategy to Microsoft‚Äôs board, suggesting the company could generate up to $5 trillion in shareholder value by 2034. Speaking at Microsoft‚Äôs annual shareholder meeting, Saylor proposed converting $200 billion in capital distributions into bitcoin holdings. He claimed this could boost annual returns from 10.4% to 15.8% and reduce Microsoft‚Äôs enterprise value at risk from 95% to 59%.\n\n\"Bitcoin is the universal, perpetual, profitable merger partner,\" Saylor argued, emphasizing its lack of counterparty risk and its potential to outperform traditional mergers and acquisitions.\n\nDespite Saylor‚Äôs push, Microsoft previously asked shareholders to vote against a bitcoin investment in a December SEC filing. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy continues its bitcoin acquisition spree, recently buying $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, bringing its holdings to over 402,000 BTC, which is valued at over $40 billion.\n\nFun Bits: Is Rep. Michael Collins the New Memecoin Whisperer?\n\nMove over crypto whales, there‚Äôs a new player in town ‚Äî and he‚Äôs got a seat in Congress! Georgia Representative Michael Collins revealed in his latest financial disclosure that he‚Äôs dipped his toes into the world of memecoins, including ski mask dog (SKI). Yes, you read that right ‚Äî a token inspired by a ski-mask-wearing dog.\n\nSKI, which boasts a $135 million market cap, has been making waves since April, and it seems Collins couldn‚Äôt resist the allure. Alongside SKI, he snagged some AERO, the currency for Aerodrome DEX, proving he‚Äôs not just about doggos; he‚Äôs got a strategy‚Ä¶ maybe.\n\nCrypto Twitter loved it, with Base blockchain creator Jesse Pollak joking, ‚Äúcool to see @RepMikeCollins being based onchain.‚Äù Collins even chimed in with a Pepe meme. Congress just got a whole lot more on trend.\n\nSince crypto users started trading SKI on Base for the first time in April, the token has climbed to a roughly $135 million market cap.

Young and Tikta\nDavid Sacks Named as AI and Crypto Czar\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has appointed venture capitalist and former PayPal COO David Sacks to the newly created position of White House AI and crypto czar.\n\nAnnounced as the appointee via Trump‚Äôs Truth Social platform yesterday, Sacks will oversee U.S. policies for artificial intelligence and crypto, including the development of a legal framework for the crypto industry.\n\nSacks, a tech investor and co-founder of early-stage VC firm Craft Ventures, will also chair the Presidential Council of Advisors for Science and Technology.\n\nTrump described the role as pivotal for advancing U.S. leadership in emerging technologies and safeguarding free speech online while countering what he described as ‚ÄúBig Tech bias and censorship.‚Äù\n\nSacks is closely tied to Silicon Valley and known for his affiliation with the ‚ÄúPayPal mafia‚Äù of figures such as Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. Craft Ventures was also the biggest investor in Multicoin Capital‚Äôs first fund, according to Kyle Samani; through that, he invested in Solana early and famously said on the All-In podcast that he did not sell SOL after the collapse of FTX.\n\nAlthough he was critical of Trump after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol Building on Jan. 6, 2021, Sacks became a significant Trump supporter during his 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nArbitrum Reaches Record $21B TVL as Incentive Programs Draw Scrutiny\n\nWhile Arbitrum community members are celebrating a new record for total value locked (TVL), the network‚Äôs incentive programs aimed at fostering ecosystem activity have come under scrutiny.\n\nArbitrum‚Äôs TVL has increased by about 67% from $12.6 billion a month ago to roughly $21 billion at press time, an all-time high for the layer-2 scaling solution that rolled out in 2021.\n\n$1B Liquidated in Crypto Markets\n\nBitcoin‚Äôs rally past the milestone $100,000 mark resulted in an immediate uptick in leverage as options traders rushed to hedge bullish bets.\n\nAs a consequence, cascading liquidations were triggered when bitcoin retreated below the $100K level. Traders using leverage face liquidation when their account equity falls below a certain threshold required to maintain their open positions.\n\nData from CoinGlass show that $1.1 billion of crypto was liquidated in a 24-hour period after BTC hit the $100K mark, with the OG cryptocurrency alone accounting for $562 million of the total.\n\nAround $300 million of long positions were liquidated in under an hour when bitcoin dropped to an intraday low of $92,957. BTC‚Äôs price has since recovered slightly, and was around $97,000 at press time.\n\nBitcoin OGs Are Moving Their Coins: CryptoQuant\n\nCumulative spending by bitcoin holders of more than 10 years neared $1 billion, or 10,600 BTC, over the past 30 days, according to data shared by onchain data and analytics firm CryptoQuant‚Äôs head of research, Julio Moreno.\n\nMoreno interpreted that spend as a sign that ‚ÄúBitcoin OGs‚Äù were moving their coins as the price of the No. 1 cryptocurrency crossed the $100,000 mark.\n\nCryptoQuant founder Ki Young Ju said on X that ‚Äúfresh capital is feeling bitcoin‚Äù as the asset‚Äôs ceiling price had increased from $129,000 to $146,000 during the previous 30 days.\n\n‚ÄúAt $102K, it's far from a bubble ‚Äî it would need a 43% surge to hit the threshold often considered a bubble,‚Äù he said.\n\nBinance Launches Onchain Yields With Babylon BTC Staking\n\nCrypto exchange Binance has launched an initiative named On-chain Yields through Babylon BTC Staking, a project that aims to ‚Äúscale bitcoin to secure the proof-of-stake economy.‚Äù\n\nThe new feature allows users to stake bitcoin and earn rewards directly through their Binance accounts, eliminating the complexity that sometimes comes with participating in onchain protocols.\n\nBabylon BTC Staking will be available for subscription starting Dec. 9 at 6 a.m. UTC. Users will be able to access the staking option through the Binance website and mobile app.\n\nA cap of 1,000 BTC will be available on a first-come, first-served basis, with a minimum subscription amount of 0.05 BTC and a maximum of 5 BTC per account.\n\nLayer N Pivots From Ethereum L2 to N1\n\nLayer N, a blockchain backed by PayPal co-founder and influential venture capitalist Peter Thiel, has announced a significant pivot from its original concept as a layer-2 for Ethereum to becoming ‚ÄúN1,‚Äù a full-stack, app-centric layer-1 blockchain.\n\nIn an announcement on Thursday, the team behind the project said N1 would be the first layer-1 with virtually unlimited scale and ultra-low latency. For users, transaction confirmations would be handled entirely on the back end, and the network itself would be accessible through wallets such as Metamask and Phantom, the team said.\n\nThe transition aims to address scalability limitations that the network encountered on Ethereum, which has been seen as an obstacle to achieving higher transaction speeds and broader application capabilities.\n\nBefore the pivot, Layer N had achieved more than 100,000 transactions per second with sub-millisecond latency, positioning itself as a competitor to traditional financial networks such as Nasdaq and Visa.\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

Young, Veronica Irwin and Tikta\nThis GIGA Influencer Was Charged by the SEC for Defrauding Investors\n\nEarly on Wednesday, Coinbase added to its listings roadmap the memecoin GIGA, one of whose biggest influencers is a former equity fund founder charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June with defrauding investors of at least $3 million.\n\nUnchained identified that individual as Joshua Goltry, who goes by the nickname Tiger and the username @NotChaseColeman on X.\n\nGoltry uses his online platform of nearly 50,000 followers to promote GIGA, which, in light of its inclusion on Coinbase‚Äôs listings roadmap on Wednesday, jumped more than 50% from 4 cents at 9:30 a.m. EST to 6 cents by 9:40 a.m.\n\nBy press time, it had settled at just under 5 cents, market data from CoinGecko show.\n\nGIGA currently has a $477 million market cap and 56,202 holders on the Solana blockchain.\n\nBitcoin Tops $100K\n\nBitcoin surged to a new record high ahead of $100,000 late on Wednesday ‚Äî an important psychological threshold for both long- and short-term holders of the OG cryptocurrency.\n\nShortly after 11 p.m. ET, bitcoin touched an intraday high of $103,900, a 7% increase over the previous 24 hours, before retreating to around $102,700 at the time of writing.\n\nThe rally comes after president-elect Donald Trump officially announced that he was nominating pro-crypto former Securities and Exchange Commissioner and digital asset industry lobbyist Paul Atkins for the role of SEC chairman (which we‚Äôll delve into in a second).\n\nThe price of bitcoin has more than doubled this year, rising 130% as it is increasingly accepted as a legitimate asset class by institutional and retail investors alike.\n\nTrump Nominates Paul Atkins for SEC Chair\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced on his Truth Social social media platform on Wednesday that he was nominating crypto lobbyist and former Securities and Exchange Commissioner Paul Atkins to chair the SEC, delivering on a promise he made to the crypto community during his campaign. On Tuesday, Unchained was first to report that Trump had asked Atkins to be his nominee for the position.\n\n‚ÄúPaul is a proven leader for common sense regulations,‚Äù Trump said in the post. ‚ÄúHe believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World.

Gox Sends $2.8B of Bitcoin to New Wallet\n\nWallets tied to bankrupt Japanese crypto exchange Mt. Gox moved 27,871 BTC worth around $2.8 billion to a new wallet on Wednesday, according to data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence.\n\nThe transfers took place just after bitcoin breached the $100,000 mark ‚Äî something that likely contributed to its brief price dip before it rebounded later in the day.\n\nMt. Gox still holds roughly 39,878 BTC, valued at $4.1 billion, in its wallet.\n\nThe exchange, which began paying off creditors earlier this year, has extended the payout timeline to Oct. 31, 2025, citing ongoing verification and processing requirements for claimants.\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

I‚Äôm Veronica Irwin, Unchained‚Äôs regulatory reporter.\n\nIt looks like Atkins has officially accepted the request from Trump to serve as his nominee for SEC Chair.\n\nTrump Officially Nominates Paul Atkins for SEC Chair\n\nAtkins has been vocal in his support of the industry and was the first libertarian to serve as an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush.\n\nAtkins, shown here at Trump Tower in 2016, is widely respected in conservative legal circles and amongst the establishment Republican party. (Associated Press)\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump announced on Truth Social Wednesday that he was nominating the pro-crypto Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), delivering on a promise he made to the crypto community during his campaign. On Tuesday, Unchained was first to report that Trump had asked Atkins to be his nominee for the position.\n\n‚ÄúPaul is a proven leader for common sense regulations. He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,‚Äù Trump said in the post.\n\nCurrent Chair Gary Gensler, who announced two weeks ago that he will resign on Jan. 20 when Trump is inaugurated, has made himself a pariah in the crypto industry for pursuing what‚Äôs been seen as a policy of regulation by enforcement. Atkins will now need to be confirmed by the Senate, unless Trump chooses to pursue a recess appointment while the Senate is out of session.\n\nAtkins served as an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush and is widely respected in conservative legal circles and amongst the establishment Republican party. Since leaving the commission he‚Äôs become outspokenly supportive of the crypto industry, having co-chaired the Token Alliance at the industry group Digital Chamber of Commerce since 2017. As founder and chief executive of the consultancy Potomak Global Partners, Atkins has advised digital finance companies on regulatory compliance topics since 2009.\n\n‚ÄúSenate Republicans really respect the tradition of Commissioner Paul Atkins,‚Äù explained George Mason University professor J.W. Verret, who previously served on the SEC Advisory Committee, in a call earlier this month. ‚ÄúHe was the first time anyone had been a true libertarian and SEC commissioner, and that was a unique thing.‚Äù\n\nThe team vetting candidates for the chairperson position reached out to crypto industry leaders two weeks ago asking for their preferences, demonstrating how much Gensler‚Äôs unpopularity has figured in Trump‚Äôs latest nomination.\n\nGensler was criticized for not establishing clear rules and guidelines for the crypto industry. Under his leadership, the SEC instead pursued a plethora of enforcement actions against crypto companies and protocols, including exchanges, token issuers, and NFT creators, for failing to register with the agency or disclose their work with what the SEC claimed were unregistered securities offerings. For his part, Gensler only clarified that he saw Bitcoin as a commodity, insisting that existing securities laws could be applied to other crypto projects, even including ether until the SEC approved spot ether ETFs.\n\nGensler had also developed a reputation for being difficult to work with. Atkins, by contrast, is known to find a way to retain strong working relationships with people despite ideological disagreements. ‚ÄúThere was never a commissioner at the history of the commission that was more respectful and thankful of the staff at the commission,‚Äù said John Reed Stark, who worked with Atkins at the SEC in 2008.\n\nRead More: Democratic SEC Commissioner Is Stepping Down, but That Doesn‚Äôt Mean That Trump Will Get 2 Outright Picks\n\nSeizing upon the industry‚Äôs hatred for Gensler, Trump began promising clearer rules for the industry this summer. Framing crypto innovation as a key point of competition between the United States and other countries, Trump promised to make the United States a ‚Äúworld capital‚Äù for crypto in part by replacing Gensler. He also said that he would appoint an ‚Äúadvisory council‚Äù focused on crypto to help him fine-tune policy, and potentially establish a national bitcoin strategic reserve, in part by not selling bitcoin that the government has seized in various financial crimes.\n\nBecause of his support for the industry, numerous crypto entrepreneurs donated both cash and crypto to Trump‚Äôs campaign. People interested in crypto who prioritized crypto policy in their voting decisions, from industry leaders to retail traders, had also tilted towards favoring Trump in the months leading up to the national election.\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nTrump Taps Hedge Fund Manager Scott Bessent to Be Treasury Secretary\n\nTrump‚Äôs Plans for a ‚ÄòCrypto Czar‚Äô and a Crypto Advisory Council: Here‚Äôs What We Know\n\nRep.

Young, Veronica Irwin and Tikta\nTrump Taps Paul Atkins as Next SEC Chair\n\nU.S. president-elect Donald Trump has selected pro-crypto former Securities and Exchange Commissioner Paul Atkins to chair the regulator, according to three sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nOne source said Trump had reached out to Atkins but was waiting on him to accept the offer.\n\nBy selecting Atkins, who has co-chaired crypto industry advocacy group Token Alliance since 2017, Trump is delivering on a promise he made to the crypto community during his campaign.\n\nThe team vetting candidates for the position reached out to crypto industry leaders two weeks ago asking for their preferences, demonstrating how much Gensler‚Äôs unpopularity has played a role in Trump‚Äôs latest nomination.\n\nDoes U.S. Rep. Michael Collins Have Memecoin Fever?\n\nMemecoin holders can add a lawmaker to their club: Republican Rep. Michael Collins, who represents Georgia‚Äôs 10th congressional district.\n\nOn Monday, Collins submitted his sixth financial disclosure of the year, revealing three purchases involving cryptocurrencies made in the previous two days.\n\nOne entailed acquiring between $1,001 and $15,000 of AERO, the native currency of decentralized exchange Aerodrome.\n\nThe remaining two, each in the same value range, included ski mask dog (SKI), according to the periodic transaction report filed with the clerk of the House of Representatives.\n\nEx-Celsius CEO Pleads Guilty to Fraud\n\nAlex Mashinsky, former CEO and founder of now-bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network, has pleaded guilty to two of the seven counts of fraud, conspiracy and market manipulation he was initially charged with, according to multiple media reports.\n\nIn a hearing on Tuesday, Mashinsky pleaded guilty to one count of commodities fraud and one count of securities fraud.\n\nEach of those counts carries a maximum prison sentence of 30 years. Mashinsky has agreed not to appeal the charges.\n\nFederal prosecutors alleged that Mashinsky had artificially inflated the value of Celsius‚Äôs CEL token and have estimated that he personally made $42 million from sales of his holdings of the asset.\n\nMashinsky‚Äôs sentencing hearing is scheduled for April 8, 2025.\n\nGrayscale Files for Spot Solana ETF\n\nCrypto investment manager Grayscale Investments has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot Solana exchange-traded fund.\n\nAccording to a 19b-4 filing lodged on Dec. 3, the proposed Grayscale Solana Trust would trade under the ticker ‚ÄúGSOL‚Äù and would essentially be a conversion of Grayscale‚Äôs existing Solana trust into an ETF.\n\nCoinbase Custody would serve as the fund‚Äôs custodian, while BNY Mellon Asset Servicing would be the administrator and transfer agent.\n\nThe Grayscale Solana Trust is currently the biggest SOL investment fund by assets under management, with assets worth around $134.2 million, representing 0.1% of all SOL in circulation.\n\nSOL rallied 6% following news of the filing. At press time, the token was changing hands for $235 on a daily trading volume of $10 billion.\n\nU.S. Moves $33M of Seized FTX-Alameda Funds\n\nWallets linked to the U.S. government have moved around $33 million of crypto from an ‚ÄúFTX Alameda Seized Funds‚Äù wallet to two unknown addresses, according to data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence.\n\nThe transfers included around $18 million of ETH, $1.5 million of memecoin SHIB, and a host of other tokens including WBTC, COMP, and BUSD.\n\nU.S. government wallets also made a series of transfers of more obscure tokens with lower market caps, such as AERGO and POWR.\n\nThe transfers are likely part of an ongoing process of managing and potentially liquidating assets seized from FTX and Alameda Research following their collapse and the subsequent legal action pursued against former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nKimchi Premium Tanks in South Korea Selloff\n\nThe so-called ‚Äúkimchi premium‚Äù ‚Äî the higher prices of cryptocurrencies on South Korean exchanges versus those of crypto on U.S. exchanges ‚Äî plummeted to an all-time low following the short-lived, unilateral imposition of martial law by the country‚Äôs president late on Tuesday night.\n\nData shared by Colin Wu, the founder of crypto media outlet WuBlockchain, on X show that Bitcoin briefly dropped to $79,167 on major South Korean exchange Upbit, while the XRP/KRW pair fell to $1.89.\n\nCryptoQuant data show that the kimchi premium dropped to a low of -40% during the early hours of Wednesday in South Korea.\n\nMarket participants attributed the price instability to South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol‚Äôs sudden declaration of martial law at 10:23 p.m. on Tuesday, a decree he reversed six hours later after both his party and opposition parties forced their way into parliament to vote it down.\n\nSince South Korean exchanges are largely dominated by retail investors, market-wide panic likely triggered the dramatic selloff.\n\nAt its peak in January 2018, the kimchi premium stood at a sky-high 55%.\n\nUnlock zero trading fees, up to 5.1% APY on USDC, boosted staking rewards and more with Coinbase One.\n\nSpread applies.

I‚Äôm Veronica Irwin, Unchained‚Äôs regulatory reporter.\n\nThe news you‚Äôve all been waiting for: president-elect Trump has selected his replacement for Gary Gensler to chair the SEC. Now it‚Äôs just on him to accept.\n\nTrump Taps Paul Atkins for Next SEC Chair, Making Good on His Crypto Promises\n\nAtkins has been vocal in his support of the industry and was the first libertarian to serve as an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush.\n\nAtkins, shown here at Trump Tower in 2016, is widely respected in conservative legal circles and amongst the establishment Republican party. (Associated Press)\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has selected the pro-crypto Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), according to three sources familiar with the discussions. One source specified that Trump has reached out to Atkins but is waiting on him to accept. By selecting Atkins, Trump is delivering on a promise he made to the crypto community during his campaign.\n\nCurrent Chair Gary Gensler, who announced two weeks ago that he will resign on Jan. 20 when Trump is inaugurated, has made himself a pariah in the crypto industry for pursuing what‚Äôs been seen as a policy of regulation by enforcement. Atkins will now need to be confirmed by the Senate, unless Trump chooses to pursue a recess appointment while the Senate is out of session.\n\nAtkins served as an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush and is widely respected in conservative legal circles and amongst the establishment Republican party. Since leaving the commission he‚Äôs become outspokenly supportive of the crypto industry, having co-chaired the Token Alliance at the industry group Digital Chamber of Commerce since 2017. As founder and chief executive of the consultancy Potomak Global Partners, Atkins has advised digital finance companies on regulatory compliance topics since 2009.\n\n‚ÄúSenate Republicans really respect the tradition of Commissioner Paul Atkins,‚Äù explained George Mason University professor J.W. Verret, who previously served on the SEC Advisory Committee, in a call earlier this month. ‚ÄúHe was the first time anyone had been a true libertarian and SEC commissioner, and that was a unique thing.‚Äù\n\nThe team vetting candidates for the chairperson position reached out to crypto industry leaders two weeks ago asking for their preferences, demonstrating how much Gensler‚Äôs unpopularity has figured in Trump‚Äôs latest nomination.\n\nGensler was criticized for not establishing clear rules and guidelines for the crypto industry. Under his leadership, the SEC instead pursued a plethora of enforcement actions against crypto companies and protocols, including exchanges, token issuers, and NFT creators, for failing to register with the agency or disclose their work with what the SEC claimed were unregistered securities offerings. For his part, Gensler only clarified that he saw Bitcoin as a commodity, insisting that existing securities laws could be applied to other crypto projects, even including ether until the SEC approved spot ether ETFs.\n\nGensler had also developed a reputation for being difficult to work with. Atkins, by contrast, is known to find a way to retain strong working relationships with people despite ideological disagreements. ‚ÄúThere was never a commissioner at the history of the commission that was more respectful and thankful of the staff at the commission,‚Äù said John Reed Stark, who worked with Atkins at the SEC in 2008.\n\nRead More: Democratic SEC Commissioner Is Stepping Down, but That Doesn‚Äôt Mean That Trump Will Get 2 Outright Picks\n\nSeizing upon the industry‚Äôs hatred for Gensler, Trump began promising clearer rules for the industry this summer. Framing crypto innovation as a key point of competition between the United States and other countries, Trump promised to make the United States a ‚Äúworld capital‚Äù for crypto in part by replacing Gensler. He also said that he would appoint an ‚Äúadvisory council‚Äù focused on crypto to help him fine-tune policy, and potentially establish a national bitcoin strategic reserve, in part by not selling bitcoin that the government has seized in various financial crimes.\n\nBecause of his support for the industry, numerous crypto entrepreneurs donated both cash and crypto to Trump‚Äôs campaign. People interested in crypto who prioritized crypto policy in their voting decisions, from industry leaders to retail traders, had also tilted towards favoring Trump in the months leading up to the national election.\n\nRelated stories from Unchained:\n\nTrump Taps Hedge Fund Manager Scott Bessent to Be Treasury Secretary\n\nTrump‚Äôs Plans for a ‚ÄòCrypto Czar‚Äô and a Crypto Advisory Council: Here‚Äôs What We Know\n\nRep.

Young and Tikta\nAave on Par With Traditional Banks as Net Deposits Reach $31B All-Time High\n\nNet deposits at decentralized finance protocol Aave, widely used for its borrowing and lending services, reached a new record as of Sunday, making the DeFi platform bigger than more than 4,000 commercial banks in the U.S.\n\nIn the past month, crypto users have added roughly $10.4 billion in net deposits. Aave‚Äôs total holdings now stand at around $31.4 billion, a 50% increase from $20.9 billion at the start of November.\n\nXRP Becomes Top-Traded Token on Binance, Coinbase as It Nears 7-Year High\n\nXRP has been the most popular token by trading volume in the past 24 hours on several centralized exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase\n\nXRP‚Äôs virality on those exchanges comes as the token climbed on Monday to a nearly seven-year high of $2.77, a 40% jump in the previous 24 hours and an increase of more than fivefold, or 433%, over the past 30 days. The Ripple ledger native token currently has a market capitalization of around $158 billion, surpassing both Tether‚Äôs USDT and Solana‚Äôs SOL, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\n\nCoinbase, Apple Pay Team up for Fiat-to-Crypto Purchases\n\nCrypto exchange Coinbase has partnered with Apple Pay for fiat-to-crypto purchases via Coinbase Onramp ‚Äî a tool that allows users to buy or transfer cryptocurrency directly from self-custody wallets and apps.\n\n‚ÄúWith Apple Pay, getting onchain only takes seconds,‚Äù Coinbase said in an announcement on Monday.\n\nThe integration means a faster end-to-end experience when converting fiat funds to crypto, particularly for the 60 million-plus users of Apple Pay in the U.S.\n\nCoinbase Onramp supports more than 60 fiat currencies and 100 cryptocurrencies, applying light-touch know-your-customer protocols to eligible purchases.\n\nNike NFT Sneaker Firm RTFKT Set to Close\n\nRTFKT (pronounced \"artifact\"), the company behind a once-viral range of NFT virtual sneakers and wearables, is to shut down its operations by the end of next month.\n\nToday we‚Äôre announcing the plan to wind down RTFKT operations,‚Äù the company said in a statement on X. ‚ÄúLooking back, we‚Äôre incredibly proud of everything we‚Äôve achieved together.‚Äù\n\nRTFKT was acquired by Nike at the height of the ‚ÄúNFT summer‚Äù in 2021 for an estimated $1 billion.\n\nThe company burst onto the digital collectible scene by selling $10,000 worth of sneakers on Nifty Gateway. It was known for developing an ecosystem of Ethereum-based NFTs and physical collectibles, including collaborations with renowned artists such as Takashi Murakami.\n\nIts decision to shutter operations comes less than two months after Nike appointed former longtime senior executive Elliott Hill, who had retired from the shoemaker in 2020, as its new CEO.\n\nRTFKT said it will release one more collection ‚Äî the MNLH X featuring the ‚ÄúBlade Drop,‚Äù a parting effort to showcase its commitment to pushing the boundaries of digital art and products ‚Äî before officially closing down.\n\nMonthly Crypto Exchange Trading Hits 3-Year High\n\nThe volume of cryptocurrency trading on centralized exchanges reached a three-year high in November.\n\nData from Bitcoin intelligence platform Newhedge shows that spot crypto trading volumes across major global exchanges topped $2.9 trillion ‚Äî the highest monthly level since May 2021.\n\nBinance continues to account for the lion‚Äôs share of trading volume, recording $1.05 trillion in November alone.\n\nIncreased crypto trading activity comes amid a slew of developments for the industry as a whole, including the re-election of pro-crypto Donald Trump as U.S. president and the upcoming departure of Gary Gensler from his post as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nU.S. Sends $1.9B of Silk Road Bitcoin to Coinbase\n\nThe U.S. government has transferred 19,800 bitcoins worth around $1.9 billion seized from shuttered online black market Silk Road to Coinbase Prime, according to data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence.\n\nThe transfer was executed in two parts: a test transfer of 0.001 BTC to a Coinbase Prime deposit address followed by a larger transfer of 19,799.999 BTC to an intermediary wallet before it was sent to Coinbase.\n\nPrevious instances of U.S. government wallets making sizable bitcoin transfers have sometimes put downward pressure on bitcoin‚Äôs price.\n\nDespite concerns that the latest transfer could imply more selling pressure in the short term, bitcoin's price has remained relatively stable, dropping only 2.2% since the transaction was executed to around $96,000 at press time.\n\nDaily Bits‚Ä¶ ‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è‚úç\n\nüé≠ A parody project using the name of the scandal-ridden energy conglomerate Enron launched in Delaware with plans to release a token, sell branded merchandise, and offer crypto services, sparking skepticism and accusations of being a scam despite its satirical framing.\n\nüìÑ WisdomTree filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\nüíº Ethena partnered with Derive, the biggest onchain options protocol, to invest millions, align sENA stakers with the Derive DAO, and offer stakers Derive points, marking the second collaboration under the Ethena Network after Ethereal.\n\nüìä MicroStrategy acquired 15,400 bitcoin worth $1.5 billion in the past week, bringing its total holdings to 402,100 BTC, funded by a share sale and averaging $95,976 per token, solidifying its dominance as a corporate bitcoin holder.\n\n‚õèÔ∏è Bitcoin miner MARA proposed a $700 million convertible note offering to repurchase existing debt and expand its bitcoin holdings following a November addition of 6,474 BTC, bringing its total to nearly 35,000 BTC.\n\nüîó Sonic Labs announced that its new layer-1 blockchain has produced its first block, setting the stage for a public launch and boasting testnet upgrades promising high transaction speeds and sub-second finality.\n\nWhat Do You Meme?\nüìà Your Market Update üìâ\n\nBTC is down 0.1%, trading at $94,725\n\nETH is up 0.4%, trading at $3,600\n\nBTC dominance: 51.83%\n\nCrypto market cap: $3.62T\n\n*All data as of today, 07:53 am ET.

Meta‚Äôs controversial stablecoin project, Diem, which met its end before it was even launched, was ‚Äú100% a political kill,‚Äù according to its co-creator, David Marcus.\n\n‚ÄúThe story, as I heard it, is that Jay Powell was told by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen at one of their biweekly meetings that allowing this project to move forward was ‚Äòpolitical suicide,‚Äô and she would not have his back if he let it happen,‚Äù Marcus said, while acknowledging that he wasn‚Äôt in the room when that conversation supposedly took place.\n\nMarcus also said the Federal Reserve had then organized calls with participating banks and intimidated them into pulling their support for Diem.\n\nDiem was officially shut down in January 2022. The project sold its assets to Silvergate Capital for $182 million.\n\nEther ETFs Pull in Record $333M\n\nU.S. spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw their biggest day of inflows on Nov. 30 as they raked in a combined $333 million on the day.\n\nBlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) and the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) accounted for the lion‚Äôs share of the incoming funds, attracting $250 million and $79 million, respectively, according to data from boutique investment management firm Farside Investors.\n\nEther ETFs ended the week with a combined $455 million of net inflows, despite a shorter week owing to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nETH briefly traded at a six-month high on Sunday, gaining 11% over the week and nearly 50% over the past month.\n\nSpectral Pauses Syntax Contracts Amid Liquidity Leak\n\nSpectral Labs has paused its smart contracts after finding a vulnerability on bonding curve contracts that resulted in around $200,000 in liquidity being drained from the platform.\n\nThe company said that access to its Syntax app ‚Äî a platform that enables users to create autonomous onchain artificial intelligence agents ‚Äî had been temporarily deactivated as security experts worked through determining the root cause.\n\nThe incident comes just two days after Spectral Labs unveiled V2 of Syntax in an early beta setup.\n\nAccording to data from Web3 bug bounty platform Immunefi, more than $71 million was lost to crypto hacks in November.\n\nThe Chopping Block: DeSci Critiques, Hyperliquid‚Äôs No-VC Model, and Freysa‚Äôs AI Games\n\nDecentralized Science: Innovation or Illusion?\n\nWelcome to The Chopping Block ‚Äì where crypto insiders Haseeb Qureshi, Tom Schmidt, Tarun Chitra, and Robert Leshner get together and give the industry insider‚Äôs perspective on crypto. This week, special guest Casey Caruso from Topology joins the crew to tackle the latest in crypto and tech. They explore the rise of AI memecoins like Freysa, blending gamified AI agents with blockchain mechanics, and the fallout from a major hack.\n\nThe discussion also highlights Hyperliquid‚Äôs $1.9 billion airdrop and its no-VC funding model, signaling new trends in token launches. The crew critiques decentralized science (DeSci), questioning its accountability and funding models, with a spotlight on Pump.Science‚Äôs tokenized longevity experiments. Finally, they examine the success of Base‚Äôs incentive-light approach and the impact of frameworks like Eliza on crypto‚Äôs evolution.\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nDaily Bits‚Ä¶ ‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è‚úç\n\nüíª MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor presented Microsoft's board with a bold proposal to integrate bitcoin into its treasury, claiming it could enhance shareholder value to the tune of $5 trillion by 2034 and significantly boost annual returns, despite a previous board recommendation against bitcoin investment.\n\n‚öñÔ∏è The SEC accused Touzi Capital of deceiving over 1,500 investors in a $115 million fraud scheme involving high-risk crypto mining and debt investments disguised as safe, predictable opportunities.\n\nüîé Ethena and Securitize entered Spark's $1 billion tokenization competition, pitching their USDtb stablecoin, backed primarily by BlackRock‚Äôs BUIDL fund, with plans for integration into the Sky ecosystem's asset management framework.\n\nüß∑ CryptoPunks skyrocketed 47% in November, with their historical significance and liquidity driving a rebound that outshone rival NFT collections during a broader market rally.\n\nüá∞üá∑ South Korea's government proposed delaying its controversial 20% crypto tax for a third time, reflecting persistent concerns about the tax's impact on smaller investors.\n\nüîê Following a $300 million hack, DMM Bitcoin will cease operations and transfer accounts to SBI VC Trade.\n\nWhat Do You Meme?\nüìà Your Market Update üìâ\n\nBTC is down 2.2%, trading at $95,054\n\nETH is down 2.8%, trading at $3,589\n\nBTC dominance: 53.17%\n\nCrypto market cap: $3.54T\n\n*All data as of today, 07:10 am ET.

Justin Drake and Martin K√∂ppelmann Debate\n\nEthereum has had an abysmal year in the midst of a crypto boom. Justin Drake and Martin K√∂ppelmann, each of whom has proposals for scaling the OG smart contract blockchain, face off.\n\nEthereum has been left behind in this bull market. As rivals like Solana gain ground in metrics such as speed, cost, and developer mindshare, questions are being raised about whether Ethereum‚Äôs reliance on Layer 2 solutions is the right path forward‚Äîor if it needs a more fundamental redesign.\n\nIn this episode, Martin K√∂ppelmann, co-founder of Gnosis, and Justin Drake, researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, discuss the trade-offs of native and based rollups, execution capacity, and Ethereum‚Äôs ability to maintain its dominance. They debate how Ethereum should address fragmentation across rollups, whether ETH has strayed from its ultrasound money narrative, and whether its deliberate pace of innovation could make it vulnerable in an increasingly competitive landscape.\n\nWhose ideas will lead Ethereum out of this dark forest?\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nTranscript Ep. 740: What‚Äôs the Best Way for Ethereum to Grow?

What‚Äôs It About?\n\nFor a week and a half, Anoncast has been all the rage for its anonymous posts enabled by zero-knowledge technology. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs taken off.\n\nFarcaster-based social media app Anoncast has quickly grabbed the crypto community‚Äôs attention‚Äîespecially after Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin jumped in.\n\nThe platform allows users to speak freely while ensuring no one‚Äînot even the platform itself‚Äîcan trace their identity. And in its short week-and-a-half life span, it‚Äôs already generated thousands of posts.\n\nIn this lighter, Black Friday edition of Unchained, developer Kartik Patel joins to discuss how Anoncast works and why the platform has taken off so quickly. He shares insights on the challenges of maintaining anonymity in a connected world, how AI intersects with these developments, and what it was like to ‚Äúnerd-snipe‚Äù Buterin.\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nTranscript Ep. 741: Vitalik Buterin Aped Into the Social Media App Anoncast.

What‚Äôs It About?\n\nFor a week and a half, Anoncast has been all the rage for its anonymous posts enabled by zero-knowledge technology. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs taken off.\n\nFarcaster-based social media app Anoncast has quickly grabbed the crypto community‚Äôs attention‚Äîespecially after Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin jumped in.\n\nThe platform allows users to speak freely while ensuring no one‚Äînot even the platform itself‚Äîcan trace their identity. And in its short week-and-a-half life span, it‚Äôs already generated thousands of posts.\n\nIn this lighter, Black Friday edition of Unchained, developer Kartik Patel joins to discuss how Anoncast works and why the platform has taken off so quickly. He shares insights on the challenges of maintaining anonymity in a connected world, how AI intersects with these developments, and what it was like to ‚Äúnerd-snipe‚Äù Buterin.\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nWeekly News Recap\nCourt Overturns Sanctions on Tornado Cash\n\nIn a pivotal ruling for the crypto industry, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has declared U.S. Treasury sanctions on Tornado Cash unlawful. The sanctions, imposed in 2022 by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), accused the cryptocurrency mixer of laundering over $7 billion in digital assets, including $455 million linked to the North Korean hacking group Lazarus.\n\nJudge Don Willett, writing for the three-judge panel, determined that Tornado Cash‚Äôs self-executing smart contracts could not be classified as ‚Äúproperty‚Äù and therefore fall outside OFAC‚Äôs regulatory authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Willett acknowledged the ‚Äúreal-world downsides‚Äù of unregulated technology but noted that updating the law is Congress‚Äôs responsibility, not the judiciary‚Äôs.\n\nThe challenge against the sanctions was spearheaded by six Tornado Cash users, with backing from Coinbase. Paul Grewal, Coinbase‚Äôs chief legal officer, hailed the decision on X as a \"historic win for crypto and liberty.‚Äù Similarly, crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky described it as a \"stunning victory\" for decentralization.\n\nHours after the court overturned Tornado Cash sanctions, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin donated $1 million in ether to Coin Center, the think tank that has helped lead the industry‚Äôs fight against the Tornado Cash sanctions.\n\nPhoto by Greg Johnson on Unsplash\nPump.fun Suspends Livestreaming After Series of Controversial Incidents\n\nPump.fun, the Solana-based platform that enables users to create and promote memecoins, has indefinitely suspended its livestreaming feature following a slew of troubling broadcasts. The feature, introduced in August, allowed creators to engage audiences by live streaming their reactions to token price movements. However, recent events exposed its misuse, leading to the platform's decision to disable it temporarily.\n\nThose events included numerous livestreams that included threats of violence and other extreme acts. In one case, a user threatened to harm his pet if his token did not reach a specific market cap. Another broadcast featured a staged suicide attempt that was later revealed to be a hoax intended to promote the creator‚Äôs memecoin. Despite no actual harm actually occurring, these incidents triggered widespread condemnation.\n\nPump.fun‚Äôs team addressed the issue in a statement, saying that ‚Äúto ensure the absolute safety of our users, we will be pausing the live streaming functionality until the moderation infrastructure is ready to handle heightened activity.‚Äù The platform also plans to increase transparency in its moderation processes.\n\nThe platform has grown rapidly, with over 3.8 million tokens created since its January launch. However, the livestreaming controversies highlight the challenges of managing user-generated content.\n\nEx-Binance Executive Alleges Bribery and Retaliation in Whistleblower Case\n\nA former Binance executive has filed a whistleblower claim in the U.K., alleging that a colleague solicited a bribe to fast-track a customer‚Äôs onboarding process, Bloomberg reported. Amrita Srivastava, who joined Binance in April 2022 after working at Mastercard, claims she was unfairly dismissed after reporting the bribery incident in April 2023.\n\nSrivastava alleged that a fellow Binance employee accepted money under the guise of providing consultancy services, all while concealing his affiliation with the company. The colleague has since left Binance. According to Srivastava, her dismissal came a month after she raised the issue, but Binance contends her termination was performance-related and unrelated to her report.\n\nThe hearing offers a rare glimpse into Binance‚Äôs internal workings as it faces broader legal challenges, including a $4.3 billion penalty in 2023 for violating U.S. anti-money laundering laws. Srivastava described Binance‚Äôs work environment as increasingly \"chaotic,\" claiming pressure to close deals compromised ethical practices.\n\nPhoto by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash\nKraken Closes NFT Marketplace\n\nCrypto exchange Kraken is shuttering its NFT marketplace nearly two years after its launch, signaling a shift in focus toward new products and services. According to a spokesperson, the company will assist users in transferring their NFTs to Kraken Wallets or self-custodial wallets of their choice.\n\nThe decision reflects ongoing challenges in the NFT market, which has struggled to recover from the 2022 crypto downturn. While blue-chip NFTs have gained traction recently‚Äîrising 90% since Donald Trump‚Äôs pro-crypto election win‚Äîthe Bitwise Blue-Chip NFT Collections Index remains 81% below its April 2022 peak.\n\nKraken‚Äôs closure aligns with broader organizational changes, including a workforce reduction and plans to launch a new blockchain in 2025 called Ink that‚Äôs designed for decentralized trading and lending.\n\nPhoto by PiggyBank on Unsplash\nCelsius Moves Forward With Second Major Creditor Payout\n\nCelsius, the bankrupt crypto lending platform, is preparing to distribute $127 million in its second payout to creditors, according to a court filing on Wednesday. The funds will come from its Litigation Recovery Account and will be allocated to creditors in categories including retail depositors, earn accounts, withhold claims, and general unsecured claims.\n\nEach eligible creditor will receive approximately 60.4% of their claims as of the bankruptcy petition date, with payments issued in either bitcoin or U.S. dollars. A weighted average price of $95,836.23 per bitcoin will be used for crypto distributions, while cash payments will be provided to those unable to receive crypto.\n\nThis marks the second significant distribution after an earlier payout of $2 billion to over 170,000 creditors in January. Celsius declared bankruptcy in 2022 after revealing a $1.2 billion deficit. Its former CEO, Alex Mashinsky, remains under legal scrutiny, facing fraud charges and a potential lengthy prison sentence.\n\nPhoto by Alexander Mils on Unsplash\nAI-Powered Memecoin Creator Clanker Drives Record Activity on Base\n\nThe Coinbase-incubated layer 2 network Base achieved an all-time high of 11.4 million daily transactions on Wednesday, fueled by an AI agent named @Clanker. This milestone also marked a new record across all Ethereum layer 2 networks, according to GrowThePie.\n\nCreated by @ProxyStudio.ETH and developer Jack Dishman, @Clanker is a large language model designed to help users deploy memecoins. Since its launch, @Clanker has facilitated the creation of over 4,700 tokens, including $CLANKER, which boasts a market cap of $113.8 million.\n\nHowever, Base struggled with the surge in activity, as many transactions on the network were reverted. Addressing the issue, Base creator Jesse Pollak explained on X that ‚ÄúA significant portion of those were reverted as a result of folks trying to capture [maximum extractable value]. Is that the most efficient use of blockspace? Absolutely not. Is it still a significant demonstration of Base scaling? Absolutely.‚Äù\n\nMicroStrategy Acquires 55,000 Bitcoin for $5.4 Billion\n\nThis week, MicroStrategy purchased an additional 55,000 BTC for $5.4 billion, reflecting an average price of $97,862 per bitcoin, according to a company filing on Nov. 25.\n\nThe acquisition was the largest single purchase of bitcoin in MicroStrategy‚Äôs history, and boosted the company‚Äôs total holdings to approximately 386,700 BTC. These holdings represent a cumulative investment of $21.9 billion at an average cost of $56,761 per bitcoin.\n\nThe latest purchase was funded by proceeds from convertible notes and sales of company stock.\n\nPhoto by Traxer on Unsplash\nTether Ends Support for Euro Stablecoin EURT\n\nTether has announced it will discontinue its Euro-backed stablecoin, EURT, citing strategic realignment and evolving European regulatory frameworks. The company has stopped minting EURT and will no longer process new issuance requests, and is encouraging current holders to redeem their tokens by Nov. 27, 2025.\n\nThe decision comes ahead of the European Union‚Äôs Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, set to take effect in December. MiCA introduces stricter rules for stablecoins within the EU market, influencing Tether's decision to focus on other projects.\n\nMeanwhile, crypto firm Schuman Financial launched EUR√òP, a MiCa-compliant Euro-backed stablecoin audited by KPMG and stored in regulated European banks.\n\nPhoto by Tabrez Syed on Unsplash\nWatch the Recap!\n\nTo stay updated with everything that‚Äôs going on in crypto, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.\n\nSubscribe\n2\nShare",

While bitcoin and solana hit new all-time highs this cycle‚Äî$99,655 for bitcoin and $263 for solana‚Äîether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, has remained stuck in their shadows.\n\nTrading at around $3,550 at the time of writing, ether is still 26% below its Nov. 2021 peak of $4,891. Even in terms of market dominance, ether has struggled, it went from commanding over 20% of the total crypto market cap in 2021 to just 13% today.\n\nOver the past week, ether is finally showing signs of life. The ETH/BTC ratio ‚Äî a metric that compares ether‚Äôs performance to bitcoin (BTC) ‚Äî jumped 19%, marking its strongest weekly performance in months. The surge is notable not just for its size but for what it represents: a potential shift in sentiment toward Ethereum, which many had written off for this year.\n\nCoinbase Sees Delayed Solana Transfers on Thanksgiving\n\nCoinbase was the subject of scrutiny on social media after the platform displayed 45-minute wait times for a Solana transfer on Thanksgiving day.\n\n‚ÄúWe understand your Solana transactions are experiencing delays, which can be due to wallet maintenance or blockchain issues. Our team is aware and working on a fix, but we don't have an estimated resolution time,‚Äù Coinbase‚Äôs support account on X said in response to one user‚Äôs complaint.\n\nThe Solana Foundation‚Äôs head of strategy Austin Federa called the statement ‚Äúdisappointing and deceptive,‚Äù noting that the issue had nothing to do with the Solana network itself, but rather, an issue on the exchange side.\n\nA few hours later, on X, a Coinbase protocol specialist said the issue had been resolved, while also pointing out that uniform support across the 50 plus blockchains that Coinbase supports can be difficult.\n\n‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs a case to be made that uniform support isn‚Äôt sufficient for keeping up with Solana under its current load,‚Äù he said.\n\nSpread applies.

The exchange also briefly suspended withdrawal and deposit services for all tokens after the incident.\n\nAt the time of writing, withdrawals for Tron-related tokens, BTC and TON had been resumed, while all deposit services were functional.\n\n‚ÄúWe always maintain reserves 1.5x greater than user assets to ensure maximum security,‚Äù said the XT team in a statement.\n\nScroll Co-founder Addresses ‚ÄòShade‚Äô Over Airdrop Design\n\nEthereum layer 2 Scroll co-founder Sandy Peng broke her silence on the project‚Äôs controversial airdrop in October, which included accusations that the core team may have been airdropping SCR tokens to their own wallets.\n\n‚ÄúSome founders are pre-launch engagement farming so hard and throwing shades so wild that I felt the need to address a few things,‚Äù said Peng on X.\n\nShe explained that the protocol Treasury was used to seed core DeFi liquidity on Scroll, and that Marks (the system to set airdrop allocations) to team wallets were negligible.\n\n‚ÄúIn hindsight, removing Marks for clarity would‚Äôve been better. Lesson learned,‚Äù she said. According to Peng, the protocol is restructuring to align to its next development phase.\n\nScroll‚Äôs total value locked (TVL) surged in the days leading up to its airdrop, but dropped dramatically after the snapshot was taken. Unchained wrote about why this situation could have been prevented.\n\nEarn bitcoin on Gemini here.\n\nBitcoin Futures Open Interest Hits Record $63 Billion\n\nBitcoin futures open interest, which represents the number of active positions held by traders, hit a record high of $63 billion earlier this week, according to data from Checkonchain.\n\nThe level of open interest has surged dramatically since the date of the U.S. election, when it sat around $40.5 billion.\n\nBitcoin‚Äôs recent rally beyond the $99,000 mark likely attracted more traders to open positions, as investors grow more optimistic on the outlook for bitcoin's price. However, at press time, bitcoin was trading around $96,500, down by 2.5% the last week.\n\nIncreased participation from hedge funds, asset managers, and other institutional investors on platforms such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has also boosted open interest of late.\n\nDaily Bits‚Ä¶ ‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è‚úç\n\nüá≠üá∞ Hong Kong proposed tax exemptions for crypto investment gains and other assets held by private funds and family offices, aiming to boost its status as a global financial hub and attract institutional interest in blockchain innovation.\n\nüéÆ A crypto player outsmarted Freysa, an AI agent designed to resist manipulation, by exploiting its code logic, securing a $47,000 prize after 482 attempts by 195 participants in a unique adversarial gaming challenge.\n\nüìà HyperLiquid launched its HYPE token, achieving a $4.2 billion fully diluted market cap with $165 million trading volume in its first hour, fueled by a 31% circulating token supply.\n\nüåê Coinbase said it would not support Celo‚Äôs migration to a layer 2 network in Optimism‚Äôs Superchain, drawing criticism from the Celo community as a potential setback for Ethereum‚Äôs scaling roadmap.\n\nüáπüáº Taiwan accelerated the implementation of strict anti-money laundering rules for crypto providers, effective Nov. 30, mandating compliance registration with penalties including imprisonment and fines for non-adherence.\n\nToday in Crypto Adoption...\n\nüá®üá≠‚ö° Switzerland's Canton of Bern parliament approved a motion to explore Bitcoin mining as a solution for utilizing surplus energy, stabilizing electricity grids, and creating economic opportunities in collaboration with local mining firms.\n\nWhat Do You Meme?\nüìà Your Market Update üìâ\n\nBTC is up 2.1%, trading at $97,053\n\nETH is down 0.7%, trading at $3,592\n\nBTC dominance: 54.4%\n\nCrypto market cap: $3.51T\n\n*All data as of today, 06:40 am ET.

Young and Tikta\nCoinbase-Incubated L2 Base Sees Record Transactions Thanks to AI Memecoin Deployer Clanker\n\nWhile memecoin activity has largely taken place on Solana, an artificial intelligence agent who goes by @Clanker on decentralized network Farcaster is helping memecoin season and onchain activity grow on Base.\n\nThe arrival of @Clanker has helped push the number of daily transactions on Base to 11.4 million, an all-time high for the Coinbase-incubated layer 2 network as well as a new record among all Ethereum layer 2s, per GrowThePie. The AI agent has created such a frenzy that many transactions on Base were reverted.\n\nSui Is One of the Worst Performing Coins in Past Week Ahead of $200 Million Token Unlock\n\nThe native token for the Sui blockchain has been among the worst performers over the past seven days ahead of its $200 million unlock slated for Dec. 1.\n\nWhile SUI has increased 109% in the last 30 days and more than quadrupled in the last three months, the token has dropped 8% in the past week to $3.40, the fourth-worst performance in the short timeframe out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, just behind POPCAT, BONK, and KAS, data from CoinGecko shows.\n\nSpread applies.

These include those with claims ranging from retail borrower/depositors, general earn, withhold, unsecured loans, and general unsecured brackets.\n\nBased on eligibility, creditors will receive payouts either in bitcoin or U.S. dollars.\n\nCelsius has already distributed over $2.53 billion to over 251,000 creditors from the first round of payouts earlier this year.\n\nTether to Discontinue EURT Stablecoin\n\nStablecoin issuer Tether will discontinue support for its Euro stablecoin, EURT. The company has ceased minting EURT and said that new EURT issuance requests will no longer be accepted.\n\nThe decision to end support for the stablecoin aligns with its ‚Äúbroader strategic direction‚Äù and evolving regulations for stablecoins in the European market, said Tether in a blog post.\n\nThe move comes ahead of the European Union‚Äôs Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation (MiCA), which comes into effect this December. MiCa was approved by parliament in April 2023 and would require European stablecoins to pass through more stringent regulations.\n\n‚ÄúTether customers holding EURT on all blockchains should redeem their holdings within one year ending on November 27th, 2025,‚Äù said Tether in the statement.\n\nIn related news, Schuman Financial launched EUR√òP, a MiCa-compliant Euro-backed stablecoin to address the scarcity of Euro-focused crypto assets. It has been audited by financial services firm KPMG and stores its reserves in European regulated banks.\n\nEarn bitcoin on Gemini here.\n\nFlashbots Introduces Block Building Network for Ethereum\n\nFlashbots, a research and development entity focused on mitigating the negative effects of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) on blockchains, has launched a new solution aimed at addressing Ethereum‚Äôs centralization issues.\n\nThe new network, called BuilderNet, is a block building network for Ethereum that runs on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and shares MEV and gas fees with users. Essentially, the network introduces a new way for multiple parties to collaborate in building blocks.\n\nFlasbots believes that distributing the process of block building across a large network can prevent chokepoints that invite censorship and rent extraction from users.\n\n‚Äú90% of blocks on Ethereum are built by just two parties today,‚Äù said Flashbots in the blog post.\n\n‚ÄúAs Ethereum considers changing the protocol to increase its censorship resistance, we believe it must also invest in decentralizing the power structures in block building that affect those properties.‚Äù\n\nPump Science Apologizes After Hacker Creates Fraud Tokens\n\nDecentralized science platform Pump Science won‚Äôt be launching any new tokens on Pump.fun ever again, the team said in a statement following an incident that resulted in a flood of fraudulent tokens being launched from its profile.\n\nIn an Ask-Me-Anything X Space hosted on Nov. 27, team member Benji Leibowitz described the incident as a ‚Äúscrew-up‚Äù and a ‚Äúhuge misstep‚Äù on Pump Science‚Äôs part.\n\nPump Science‚Äôs private keys linked to its Pump.fun profile were exposed on GitHub, allowing a hacker to create fraud tokens.

Young and Tikta\nTreasury Overstepped With Tornado Cash Sanctions, Rules U.S. Appeals Court\n\nThe U.S. Department of Treasury‚Äôs sanctions against decentralized crypto mixer Tornado Cash were unlawful, according to a ruling from the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n‚ÄúThe immutable smart contracts at issue in this appeal are not property because they are not capable of being owned,‚Äù stated the ruling filed on Nov. 26.\n\n‚ÄúBecause these immutable smart contracts are not ‚Äòproperty‚Äô under the word‚Äôs common, ordinary meaning or under OFAC definitions, we hold that OFAC exceeded its statutory authority.‚Äù\n\nSmart contracts must now be removed from the sanctions list and US persons will now be allowed to use the protocol, said Paul Grewal, Coinbase‚Äôs chief legal officer, on X,\n\nConsensys lawyer Bill Hughes echoed similar sentiments on X, hailing the court‚Äôs decision as ‚Äúa good win‚Äù for the industry and one which the Supreme Court would be unlikely to reverse.\n\nAave Is Using New Oracles by Chaos Labs to Automate Its Risk Management System\n\nAave, the dominant lending protocol in the decentralized finance space, has started using oracles developed by Chaos Labs, a risk management firm that has a long working relationship with Aave.\n\nThe move automates processes for changing the lending protocol‚Äôs risk parameters such as liquidation thresholds as well as supply and borrowing capacities.\n\nSpread applies.

The third quarter of 2024 saw NFT trading volumes decrease by 61% from $3.1 billion at the start of this year to $1.2 billion, according to data from CoinGecko.\n\nRen Protocol Promises V2 After Binance Delists Token\n\nControversial interoperability protocol Ren said in an X post on Tuesday that version 2 is coming, with the team anticipating it will have a ‚Äúmore outsized and sustainable impact on DeFi than Ren v1.‚Äù\n\nThe team said it plans to address protocol design and governance lessons learned from the earlier version, which was shut down in December 2022. At the time, the team attributed the decision to events related to FTX and Alameda and in April 2023, Ren transferred nearly all of its assets to FTX debtors‚Äô wallet for safeguarding in case of a possible shutdown.\n\nRen‚Äôs v2 announcement comes after its native token REN was named in a Binance delisting notice. The price of REN sank 20% following the news to a low of $0.042. Its market cap has declined from its 2021 peak of $1.7 billion to around $42 million at press time.\n\nUniswap Announces ‚ÄòLargest Bug Bounty in History‚Äô Ahead of V4\n\nDecentralized exchange Uniswap will offer up to $15.5 million in rewards to bounty hunters who discover critical flaws in the protocol‚Äôs v4 core contracts.\n\nUniswap Labs said ‚Äúthe largest in history‚Äù bug bounty was an extra step to make sure that the new version of the protocol is as secure as possible, given that the codebase has already been reviewed by nine independent auditors.\n\nUniswap v4 is a major protocol upgrade that introduces hooks, a feature that allows developers to inject custom logic at specific points in a pool's lifecycle, enabling dynamic adjustments and diverse use cases.\n\nIt also aims to reduce gas fees and make pool creation 99% cheaper compared to v3.\n\nEarn bitcoin on Gemini here.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the Best Way for Ethereum to Grow? Justin Drake and Martin K√∂ppelmann Debate\n\nEthereum has had an abysmal year in the midst of a crypto boom. Justin Drake and Martin K√∂ppelmann, each of whom has proposals for scaling the OG smart contract blockchain, face off.\n\nEthereum has been left behind in this bull market. As rivals like Solana gain ground in metrics such as speed, cost, and developer mindshare, questions are being raised about whether Ethereum‚Äôs reliance on Layer 2 solutions is the right path forward‚Äîor if it needs a more fundamental redesign.\n\nIn this episode, Martin K√∂ppelmann, co-founder of Gnosis, and Justin Drake, researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, discuss the trade-offs of native and based rollups, execution capacity, and Ethereum‚Äôs ability to maintain its dominance. They debate how Ethereum should address fragmentation across rollups, whether ETH has strayed from its ultrasound money narrative, and whether its deliberate pace of innovation could make it vulnerable in an increasingly competitive landscape.\n\nWhose ideas will lead Ethereum out of this dark forest?\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pods, Fountain, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.\n\nTranscript Ep. 740: What‚Äôs the Best Way for Ethereum to Grow?

Young, Veronica Irwin and Tikta\nPump.Fun Pauses Live Streaming Feature as Dark Side of the Memecoin Factory Emerges\n\nPump.Fun, the Solana-based protocol that enables users to create and gamble on memecoins, has soared in activity, in part due to the protocol‚Äôs popular frontend feature that enables users to live stream their reactions to their token‚Äôs price movements.¬†\n\nHowever, the ability to self-broadcast on Pump.Fun was disabled indefinitely on Monday due to concerns about user safety.\n\nBitcoin Sell Pressure Hits 7-Month High: Who‚Äôs Selling?\n\nLong-term bitcoin holders are taking profits, according to onchain analytics firm Glassnode, which found that selling pressure has reached negative 336,000 BTC per month ‚Äî¬† the highest level since April 2024.\n\nWithin the cohort of long-term holders, those who held bitcoin for between six to 12 months spent an average of 26,500 BTC per day in profits. These holders spent bitcoin with an average cost basis that was 71% lower than the market price, meaning they had a lot to gain from bitcoin‚Äôs recent rally to the upside.\n\n‚ÄúWith Bitcoin surging from $74K to $99K, they capitalized big on the rally,‚Äù said Glassnode.\n\nAt the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at around $92,047, down 6.1% over the last 24 hours. The leading digital asset‚Äôs dip below the $91,500 mark earlier in the day likely contributed to the $694 million in liquidations observed across major exchanges over the last 24 hours.\n\nSpread applies.

Some users have compared Orca‚Äôs strategies to Ethereum‚Äôs infamous MEV bot ‚Äújaredfromsubway.‚Äù\n\nEarn bitcoin on Gemini here.\n\nWisdomTree Files for Spot XRP ETF\n\nWisdomTree has established a trust entity in Delaware for an XRP exchange-traded fund ‚Äî the preliminary step for approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in launching a fund.\n\nThe filing comes after the global asset manager, which manages $113 billion in assets, recently launched a low-cost XRP ETP in Europe.\n\nAsset managers Bitwise, Canary Capital, and 21Shares have also filed for XRP ETFs over the last few weeks.\n\nAt the time of writing, XRP was changing hands at around $1.3, down 10% over the last 24 hours.\n\nDaily Bits‚Ä¶ ‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è‚úç\n\nüí∞ MicroStrategy made its largest-ever bitcoin purchase, adding $5.4 billion worth of bitcoin and increasing its holdings to 386,700 coins, valued at $37 billion.\n\nüî• Ethereum‚Äôs blob usage surged to over 21,000 per month, matching record highs as Layer 2 solutions such as Base and Arbitrum leveraged blobs for scalable, low-cost transaction bundling, burning $560,000 in fees last week.\n\nüì± Phantom Wallet integrated support for the Base blockchain, enabling users to interact with Base-based tokens, dApps, and memes, potentially driving new activity and liquidity on the network.\n\nüíµ Jupiter DAO on Solana opened voting on a $1.5 billion airdrop proposal to distribute 1.4 billion JUP tokens to active users and stakers, aiming to grow the platform‚Äôs ecosystem.\n\nüá∫üá∏ Justin Sun invested $30 million in Trump-linked World Liberty Financial (WLFI), controversially acquiring more tokens than the project initially planned to sell, raising questions about its token limits.\n\nThe $$$ Corner‚Ä¶\n\nü§ñ Talus Network secured $6 million in a Polychain-led round at a $150 million valuation to expand its decentralized AI ecosystem, including plans for a TikTok-linked AI dating app and the TAI token.\n\nüìà OpenTrade raised $4 million in a seed extension round led by AlbionVC, with participation from a16z Crypto and CMCC Global, to further develop stablecoin-based yield products for asset managers.\n\nWhat Do You Meme?\nüìà Your Market Update üìâ\n\nBTC is down 6.4%, trading at $91,824\n\nETH is down 5.5%, trading at $3,302\n\nBTC dominance: 55.22%\n\nCrypto market cap: $3.29T\n\n*All data as of today, 07:54 am ET.

Young, Veronica Irwin and Tikta\nCrypto Liquidations Top $500 Million as Bitcoin Falters\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies saw a volatile 24 hours as liquidations across centralized exchanges topped $500 million.\n\nData from CoinGlass shows that of the day‚Äôs $585 million in crypto liquidations, $468 million came from traders in long positions as bitcoin fell to an intraday low of $95,830 late on Sunday.\n\nThe largest single liquidation order took place on Binance on a BTC/USDT pair valued at $13.24 million.\n\nOver a shorter time frame of four hours, Sandbox‚Äôs native token SAND accounted for the majority of crypto liquidations. GameFi tokens appeared to defy the broader market selloff, with SAND gaining as much as 65% over 24 hours.¬†\n\nAfter the sell-off, bitcoin quickly rebounded and is now changing hands for $98,100.\n\nWBTC Sinks Under $5,000 in Flash Crash on Binance\n\nThe price of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) saw a sharp and sudden drop to an all-time low of $5,200 on crypto exchange Binance before quickly rebounding to above the $97,800 mark.\n\nThe flash crash took place on Nov. 23. One of the primary causes of flash crashes is a sudden shortage of buyers in the market, known as a liquidity crunch, or market manipulation tactics such as spoofing, where traders place fake orders to manipulate prices.\n\nLast week, Coinbase said it would delist WBTC citing failures to meet its listing standards. WBTC custodian BiT Global accused Coinbase of doing so in order to propel its own product, Coinbase Wrapped BTC (cbBTC).\n\nSpread applies.

Around 52% of that amount is attributable to the SEC‚Äôs jury trial win against Terraform Labs and its co-founder and CEO Do Kwon.\n\n‚ÄúThe Division of Enforcement is a steadfast cop on the beat, following the facts and the law wherever they lead to hold wrongdoers accountable,‚Äù said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a statement on Nov. 22.\n\nGensler is set to step down from his position on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nAccording to a report from Social Capital Markets, the SEC‚Äôs 11 enforcement actions on crypto firms in 2024 resulted in an average fine of $426 million, far surpassing the average fine in prior years.\n\nHoward Lutnick‚Äôs Cantor Fitzgerald Acquired 5% Ownership Stake in Tether: Report\n\nHoward Lutnick, who is President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs pick for commerce secretary as well as the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, has reportedly secured a deal for the financial services firm to acquire a 5% ownership stake in stablecoin issuer Tether.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the equity stake was potentially valued at as much as $600 million.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald's involvement lends credibility to Tether, which has faced scrutiny over its reserves and regulatory compliance.¬†\n\nThe report cited a business associate of both firms saying that Lutnick will use his political clout to try to defuse threats facing Tether. However, another spokesperson called the notion that Lutnick might use his new position to influence legislation ‚Äúlaughable.‚Äù\n\nEarn bitcoin on Gemini here.\n\nDemocratic SEC Commissioner Is Stepping Down, but That Doesn‚Äôt Mean Trump Will Get 2 Outright Picks\n\nWhen Democratic SEC Commissioner Jaime Liz√°rraga announced on Friday that he planned to step down from the agency on Jan. 17 because of his wife‚Äôs health issues, the crypto community jumped to the conclusion that Trump would have sole discretion to choose two SEC commissioners ‚Äî one to replace outgoing chair Gary Gensler, and the other to replace Liz√°rraga.¬†\n\nHowever, that appears unlikely to be the case now.¬†\n\nTrump Taps Hedge Fund Manager Scott Bessent to Be Treasury Secretary\n\nDonald Trump has nominated hedge fund manager Scott Bessent for the role of Treasury Secretary, according to a post from Trump on Truth Social Friday.\n\nAs Secretary, Bessent would be one of the most important voices after Trump himself on the United States economy, and would have the power to sanction foreign crypto projects, as well as play a role in pursuing or discouraging the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Cabinet nominees are almost always approved by the Senate. However, Trump posted on Truth Social earlier this month that he could use recess appointments to push through his nominees in a ‚Äútimely manner‚Äù if the Senate delays the process.¬†\n\nXRP, XLM, and ADA Lead Market Gains Following Gensler Resignation Announcement\n\nTokens that pumped in the most recent crypto bull market in 2021 ‚Äî namely, Ripple Labs‚Äô XRP, Stellar Lumens‚Äô XLM, and Cardano‚Äôs ADA ‚Äî are outpacing the market over the past day after the chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, announced on Thursday that he will be resigning from his position on Jan. 20.¬†\n\nDaily Bits‚Ä¶ ‚úçÔ∏è‚úçÔ∏è‚úç\n\nüí∏ Memecoin promoters on Pump.fun sparked outrage by using NSFW shock content, including extreme acts and explicit videos, to attract investors, drawing sharp criticism from the crypto community and raising concerns about moderation.\n\nüîí Alexey Pertsev, Tornado Cash developer sentenced for money laundering, had his detention extended by a Dutch court, complicating his ability to prepare an appeal against his five-year prison sentence.\n\nüö´üá´üá∑ Polymarket blocked access for French traders after the country's gaming authority launched an investigation into its compliance with gambling laws, highlighting regulatory challenges for prediction markets.\n\nüìä Cboe Global Markets announced the launch of cash-settled index options tied to spot Bitcoin ETFs on Dec. 2, offering institutional and retail investors a simplified way to hedge or speculate on Bitcoin's price movements.\n\n‚úÇÔ∏è Sky Mavis, creator of Axie Infinity, laid off 21% of its staff in a move to refocus on core products and prepare for accelerated growth in 2025, despite claiming strong financial health.\n\nThe $$$ Corner‚Ä¶\n\nüå± Former Coatue fintech head Michael Gilroy and Coinbase board member Gokul Rajaram are co-founding a venture firm, which is aiming to raise $500 million¬† ‚Äî with the formal fundraising process starting in 2025 ‚Äî to invest in early-stage fintech and software startups.\n\nWhat Do You Meme?\nüìà Your Market Update üìâ\n\nBTC is up 1.3%, trading at $98,136\n\nETH is up 5.1%, trading at $3,490\n\nBTC dominance: 55.24%\n\nCrypto market cap: $3.51T\n\n*All data as of today, 07:40 am ET.
