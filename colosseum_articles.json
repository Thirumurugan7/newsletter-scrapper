I‚Äôll also have the opportunity to bring you deeper insights into everything I already cover.\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt already, be sure to create an account on Colosseum. It‚Äôs becoming the ultimate resource hub for turning your ideas into reality.\n\nI‚Äôm excited to join the Colosseum team and can‚Äôt wait to help grow the Solana ecosystem alongside you. Let‚Äôs build something amazing together!\n\nAnd on that note here is the latest roundup for Solana builders...\n\nüéä Market-Driven Emissions Proposal\n\nSolana's current inflation mechanism uses a fixed emissions schedule to reward validators and stakers who maintain the network's security.¬†\n\nThis schedule began with an 8% annual inflation rate at the network's launch, designed to incentivize early participation. This rate decreases by 15% each year and is expected to stabilize at 1.5% around 2030.\n\nValidators play a key role, receiving newly issued SOL for validating transactions and sharing these rewards with stakers who delegate their tokens.¬†\n\nThese rewards are composed not only of emissions but also of transaction fees and Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which validators earn by strategically ordering transactions.\n\nThe fixed emissions schedule, while providing predictability, has limitations.¬†It doesn't adapt to changing network conditions, meaning token issuance remains constant regardless of the economic climate or staking levels.¬†\n\nThis rigidity was less of a concern when Solana was nascent and needed to attract validators. However, as the network matured, validators became less reliant on token emissions for income, supplementing it with MEV and transaction fees.\n\nThe current model continues to benefit stakers through emissions but dilutes the value of SOL held by non-stakers. This has raised concerns about inflation's impact on SOL's overall utility and attractiveness.\n\nThe proposed governance change, SIMD-0228, introduces Smart Emissions, aiming to make inflation rates more responsive to real-time network conditions.¬†\n\nThe proposal sets a target staking participation rate of 50%, calculated as the total staked SOL divided by the circulating supply.\n\nIf staking participation falls below 50%, the network would increase token emissions to incentivize more staking and bolster security.\nConversely, if staking participation exceeds 50%, emissions would decrease to mitigate inflationary pressure and reduce staking rewards.\n\nThis adjustment would be programmatic, automatically responding to changes in staking levels.\n\nThe proposal includes upper and lower bounds for emissions.¬†\n\nThe upper bound would align with Solana's current inflation schedule, preventing excessive emissions. The lower bound would allow emissions to temporarily drop to zero if staking participation consistently surpasses the target.¬†\n\nThis flexibility allows the network to adapt without over-issuing tokens.\n\nIf implemented, this proposal could significantly alter Solana's economic dynamics. Validators and stakers might experience reduced rewards, especially if MEV revenue doesn't fully compensate for lower emissions.¬†\n\nHowever, overall inflation would likely decrease, and SOL could even become deflationary over time, mitigating dilution for non-stakers and potentially improving $SOL's utility in DeFi.\n\nThis shift would mark a significant evolution in Solana's monetary policy, transitioning from fixed schedules to a more flexible and responsive model.\n\nSolana‚Äôs Inflation Rate Could Drop Under Multicoin Proposal\n\nü§ñ Solana Virtual Machine\n\nThis deep-dive into Solana's SVM compares its multi-threaded, parallel processing capabilities to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), highlighting their fundamental differences and implications for developers.\n\nIt also talks about the key role of Sealevel, the technology that enables Solana to process transactions concurrently, and explains how localized fee markets further distinguish Solana from Ethereum‚Äôs global fee model.\n\nFor Solana developers, understanding the SVM is key to appreciating how its architecture supports dApps with unmatched efficiency.\n\nBy utilizing the full capacity of validator hardware, the SVM offers a game-changing alternative to the single-threaded EVM, which struggles with bottlenecks during peak demand.\n\nThis article will help deepen your understanding of what sets Solana apart from other blockchains and how the SVM opens new possibilities for dApp development.\n\nSolana Virtual Machine (SVM): The Engine Behind Solana‚Äôs Speed\n\nüí∞ Multicoin's Solana Thesis\n\nMulticoin Capital‚Äôs latest thesis, authored by Kyle Samani, examines how Solana can play a central role in building what they describe as Internet Capital Markets.¬†\n\nThe report focuses on how Solana‚Äôs technology and ecosystem have matured to address challenges in finance, with an emphasis on efficiency, accessibility, and scalability.\n\nSince its early days in 2018, Solana has grown significantly, now valued at $100 billion.¬†\n\nIt has one of the fastest-growing developer ecosystems and has surpassed Ethereum in several key metrics, including trading volumes and daily active addresses.¬†\n\nMulticoin views Solana as a platform capable of outperforming TradFi systems, not just on cost and speed, but also by retaining blockchain-native features like permissionless access and composability.\n\nA central argument is that Solana has the potential to reduce financial services fees by up to 99% while still increasing its market cap to exceed major financial incumbents.\n\nThe thesis explains that while payments are not a primary revenue driver for blockchains, they are essential for adoption.\n\nSolana‚Äôs transaction fees are extremely low, making it far cheaper than traditional payment systems. This affordability, coupled with its ease of use, encourages the growth of wallet adoption and ecosystem engagement.\n\nSome of the key factors that Kyle highlights in this report are:¬†\n\nIntroduction of Conditional Liquidity to tighten spreads and reduce risks for market makers\nImplementation of Multiple Concurrent Leaders to decentralize price discovery and reduce latency\nCapable of handling traditional assets, crypto-native assets, and new financial instruments\nRevenue and Value Growth Through MEV\nExpanding Total Addressable Market¬†\nExpected to play a larger role in global finance as blockchain adoption grows\n\nThe report describes Solana‚Äôs broader goal as creating a permissionless financial system that integrates low fees, global accessibility, real-time auditability, and composability.¬†\n\nWhile Solana serves as the infrastructure, its ecosystem is designed to support¬† both traditional and crypto-native assets while enabling new market opportunities.\n\nThe Solana Thesis: Internet Capital Markets\n\n‚ö° Quick Hits\n\nThe Resources You Need to Grow Your Crypto Startup From 0 to 100 - @solana\n\nMetaplex Core, the next-generation standard for NFTs on Solana - @dfrvci\n\nThe Truth about Solana Local Fee Markets - Helius\n\nSIMD-0212: Slashing On Solana - Anza\n\nHow to Create a Telegram Agent With Solana Agent Kit (Video) - yuki\n\nSolana's RWA Tokenisation Ecosystem by Asset Category - @AgriDexPlatform\n\nIntroducing Agentic Blinks - @sendaifun\n\nWhat's New in Backpack Wallet - @Backpack\n\nIntroducing New Filters on Solscan's Transactions Tab - @solscanofficial\n\n‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Resources\n\nPinocchio is a zero-dependency library to create Solana programs that eliminates the dependency on the solana-program crate to write on-chain programs, which are optimized in terms of both compute units consumption and binary size.\n\np-token is a proof-of-concept of a fully-compatible reimplementation of the SPL Token program using Pinocchio\n\nLiteSVM is a fast and lightweight library for testing Solana programs that creates an in-process Solana VM optimized for program developers making it much faster to run and compile than alternatives like solana-program-test and solana-test-validator.\n\nSolana Wallet Adapter Base UI (ShadCN) is a modular and customizable wallet adapter UI built with shadcn/ui and TailwindCSS that addresses limitations in @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui around UI and UX customization.\n\nüí∏ Funding\n\nPhantom has raised a $150 million Series C funding round at a $3 billion valuation to drive innovation, strategic acquisitions, and partnerships to modernize consumer finance, enhance wallet infrastructure, and expand peer-to-peer payment and social discovery features.\n\nüë©‚Äçüîß Get Hired\nHelius is hiring a Principal Platform Engineer and Senior Software Engineer to build the infrastructure to support a suite of developer tools and services.\nCrossmint is hiring a Developer Growth, Web3 Startups (US) to be the face of Crossmint to the developer community and bring early-stage web3 startups to the platform.\nPerena is hiring a Senior Backend Engineer to build and scale professional-grade applications across multiple platforms.\nParity Finance is hiring a Senior Protocol + Full Stack Engineer to build the Parity liquid staking platform and trading infrastructure.\nüéß Listen to This\nLightspeed\n\nThis episode of Lightspeed covers how Solana performed over the weekend as Trump launched his meme coin, the record on chain activity that occurred, how Solana managed to perform, the impact of Jito, and what happened with Coinbase.\n\nSolana's All Time High Chain Activity\n\nBonus Episodes\n\nHelium Mobile: World's First Crypto Carrier on Solana with Coco Tang - The Index\n\nIn this episode Alex Kehaya talks with Coco Tang, General Manager of Helium Mobile, about how blockchain is revolutionizing the telecom industry, Helium‚Äôs origins as an IoT network, and its ambitious leap into mobile infrastructure\n\nThe Encrypted Supercomputer with Yannik from Arcium - DCo Podcast\n\nIn this episode, Arcium CEO Yannik discusses a groundbreaking approach to privacy in crypto, rejecting the need for separate \"privacy chains\" like Zcash in favor of an encrypted supercomputer that acts as a trustless, plug-and-play privacy layer for applications\n\nFollow¬†@mikehale¬†on X or Warpcast!\n\nThanks for reading ‚úåÔ∏è\n\nI hope you found something useful here!

    "content": "üöÄ Investments and Themes for 2025\n\nColosseum launched in early 2024 to help developers compete and experiment across a wide spectrum of Solana-based products through online hackathons.¬†\n\nSince then, the team has reviewed thousands of submissions, accepted multiple cohorts into its accelerator, and made pre-seed investments in more than 20 promising startups.¬†\n\nDrawing on that hands-on experience, Colosseum has identified 12 high-growth verticals that are set to shape the Solana and broader crypto landscape in 2025, each one addressing real-world challenges.\n\nA key theme running through all twelve verticals is a renewed focus on real-world utility and sophisticated market design.¬†\n\nWhether it‚Äôs a sports fan token that unlocks new ways to engage with your favorite team, or a next-gen aggregator that forward-sells staked yield, these protocols aim to bring deep liquidity, better user experiences, and new revenue streams on-chain.¬†\n\nAnd while Colosseum doesn‚Äôt see AI as its own siloed vertical, the team expects AI to become an indispensable layer across each of these categories by streamlining data insights, risk management, and user onboarding in ways we haven‚Äôt even imagined yet.\n\nFor developers and builders looking to stay ahead, these areas offer opportunities to create new markets and leverage existing ones. Expect these verticals to play an outsized role as we move into 2025 and beyond.\n\nColosseum‚Äôs 2024 Investments and Themes for 2025\n\n‚û∞ Accounts Lattice Hash\n\nSolana developers have introduced a proposal to tackle the state growth problem by implementing a lattice-based system known as the Accounts Lattice Hash.¬†\n\nAccording to the proposal (SIMD-215), \"the main goal is to scale Solana to billions of accounts and compute a ‚Äòhash of all accounts‚Äô in practical time and space.‚Äù¬†\n\nOne of the core changes involves homomorphic hashing, a method that verifies only the accounts that have changed, rather than reprocessing every account on the network.¬†\n\nüó®Ô∏è\nThink of it like cleaning a house. Instead of scrubbing every single room every day, you only tidy up the spaces that got messy.\n~ Republik Labs\n\nAt the end of each epoch, Solana‚Äôs Epoch Accounts Hash mechanism must rehash all accounts. As the size of Solana state grows, this process becomes increasingly resource-intensive.\n\nIn contrast, the lattice-based method accumulates individual account hashes directly and updates only the accounts that have changed.¬†\n\nBy eliminating the need for full recalculations, the approach will reduce computational overhead. This upgrade also aims to preserve the network‚Äôs existing security level, offering a path to global scale without sacrificing safety.\n\nIf the community approves this improvement, Solana‚Äôs infrastructure could set a new benchmark for blockchain scalability.\n\nNew Solana proposal aims to fix scalability issues with ‚Äòlattice‚Äô system\n\nüõ°Ô∏è Quantum Resistant Winternitz Vault\n\nGoogle‚Äôs quantum computing project Willow made headlines recently and raised concerns in the crypto world.¬†\n\nBlockchains use cryptographic systems built on mathematical problems that quantum computers could solve much faster, ultimately making it possible to reverse-engineer private keys from public keys.\n\nWhile we're still a long way off from that ever happening, Solana developer Dean Little has introduced the Solana Winternitz Vault, an optional quantum-resistant vault that leverages hash-based signature technology.\n\nThe Solana Winternitz Vault is essentially a specialized account system that uses hash-based signatures instead of traditional elliptic curve cryptography.¬†\n\nThe idea is simple: Each time a user makes a transaction, a new private key is generated and revealed, minimizing the chance of a quantum computer exploiting previously exposed public keys.¬†\n\nUnder the hood, it leverages Winternitz One-Time Signatures (W-OTS) along with a Merkle root structure for added security and tamper-proof verification.\n\nWhile the vault is an entirely optional feature, its hash-based signature approach shows an awareness of quantum threats and a commitment to protecting user funds as quantum computing continues to advance.\n\nSolana can be quantum-resistant today, here‚Äôs how\n\nüó≥Ô∏è Solana Founder Survey\n\nLightspeed polled 42 anonymous Solana founders on a variety of topics in the Solana space.¬†\n\nMany founders remain bullish on Solana‚Äôs trajectory and culture, even saying if Solana didn‚Äôt exist, they wouldn‚Äôt be in crypto at all.¬†\n\nHowever, among those open to other ecosystems, Base and Sui ranked as the most appealing.¬†\n\nFounders also shared concerns about MEV on Solana, noting it drives up costs and makes transaction ordering more complex.\n\nMemecoins got a ‚Äúmostly good‚Äù label from respondents where AI agents were called ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù and seen by some as mostly hype.¬†\n\nOn the infrastructure side, founders said the demand for blockspace is growing fast, and they want bigger blocks to keep fees manageable.\n\nOverall, founder sentiment highlights excitement about the future of Solana, a desire to fend off rising MEV concerns, and a readiness to innovate with new use cases.\n\nSolana founders anonymously weigh in on other teams, VCs, and the alleged cabal\n\n‚ö° Quick Hits\n\n10 AI Agent ideas you can build - @ideasdotfun\n\nDev Tips: The Payer-Authority Pattern - @blockiosaurus\n\nSolana Token Accounts Made Simple: Why Should You Close Them? - RayBot\n\nSolana AI Hackathon and Token Launches: A Note to Builders and Investors - @yashhsm\n\nHow might a quantum 0-day on Solana play out? - @deanmlittle\n\nDePIN Will Grow 100-1,000x Over the Next Decade - Solana Floor\n\n‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Resources\n\nsolana-winternitz-vault is a quantum-resistant lamports vault that leverages Winternitz One-Time Signatures (WOTS) for security.\n\nüë©‚Äçüîß Get Hired\nGLAM is hiring a Founding Product Engineer to build an onchain asset management platform on Solana\nJito Labs is hiring a Protocol Engineer to to build the future of decentralized finance on Solana\nSNS is hiring a Full-Stack Developer to help build out their platform\nFlipside is hiring a Senior Software Engineer to build solutions that leverage the power of blockchain technology\nZeta Markets is hiring a Rust Engineer - Core Exchange Backend to build and optimize core backend systems\nüéß Listen to This\nCryptonews\n\nIn this episode, Jason Li, Co-founder of Solayer Labs, explains how their restaking protocol on Solana aims to boost blockchain performance, scaling solutions, including tokenizing real-world assets and using specialized hardware to reach 1M transactions per second.\n\nJason Li, Co-founder of Solayer Labs, on Restaking, Scaling Solana, Tokenizing RWAs, and more\n\nBonus Episodes\n\nFrom Mixing Music to Teaching Computers to Trade - DCo Podcast\n\nShaw, the founder of AI16Z DAO and creator of the Eliza framework, explores how a seemingly simple idea of helping developers access better trading strategies evolved into a platform that's reshaping how we think about AI in crypto.\n\nFollow¬†@mikehale¬†on X or Warpcast!\n\nThanks for reading ‚úåÔ∏è\n\nI hope you found something useful here!

    "content": "We launched Colosseum in early 2024 with the goal of empowering developers to compete, experiment, and build products across a broad spectrum of crypto use cases through our online hackathons. In partnership with the Solana Foundation and numerous ecosystem organizations, we‚Äôve built the largest hackathons in crypto and helped accelerate the rapid growth of Solana‚Äôs startup ecosystem.\n\nFollowing each major Solana hackathon (Renaissance and Radar), we accepted two accelerator batches each with 10+ winning teams. And to date, we‚Äôve made pre-seed investments in 20+ startups. Reviewing thousands of hackathon submissions and working with talented founders in our accelerator program has given us an up close view of crypto's rapidly emerging markets. As the year comes to a close, we‚Äôre excited to share our perspective on 12 high-growth verticals where we saw exciting development in 2024, and that we believe will continue to shape the crypto landscape in 2025. In addition, we highlight the hackathon winners and teams we‚Äôve backed who we believe are creating the markets that will drive each category forward.\n\nNote: Many of the projects mentioned below are currently on devnet, with mainnet deployments expected in Q1 and Q2 2025.\n\nNon-Sovereign SoV Assets\n\nOver the past decade, Bitcoin has proven that a non-sovereign store-of-value (SoV) asset can gain global acceptance and secure a core position within the global financial system. While Bitcoin‚Äôs incredible success validated the concept, we believe it also opened the door for additional digital gold-like assets to reach escape velocity and meaningful liquidity in the coming years.\n\nOre stands out as the most promising non-sovereign asset tailored specifically for onchain ecosystems. Strong community support, thoughtful economic design, and increased liquidity‚Äîfueled by ‚ÄúBoosts‚Äù on key trading pairs‚Äîpositioned Ore well in 2024. We‚Äôre excited to see the core team use these structural advantages to build new products that further its adoption in the broader onchain economy.\n\nFutarchy\n\nDAOs have long struggled with governance, often relying on 1-token-1-vote structures that can stifle progress, resulting in a waste of both human and treasury capital. MetaDAO offers a transformative ‚Äúfutarchy as a service‚Äù framework, enabling organizations to make decisions through markets rather than traditional voting mechanisms.\n\nMetaDAO is already integrated into leading projects like Drift and Jito. We believe futarchy will continue to solidify itself as the default governance module in the Solana ecosystem (and crypto more broadly) in 2025‚Äîone that overcomes entrenched governance challenges and accelerates dynamic decision-making.\n\nDecentralized Stablecoins\n\nStablecoins like USDC and USDT have achieved widespread adoption, and crypto-native products such as Ethena are also on the rise. However, existing stablecoin implementations often sacrifice censorship resistance, capital efficiency, or both.\n\nA new wave of experimentation is underway, with the aim of creating stablecoins that offer robust stability while also delivering more decentralization, transparency, and higher yield potential. Reflect and Hylo represent two of the most promising protocols leading the decentralized stablecoin renaissance in 2025.\n\nCrypto‚Äôs Growth Stack\n\nAs consumer-facing products begin to dominate venture funding in the Solana ecosystem, the need for sophisticated growth tools will increase in lockstep. Just as Web2 startups have grown up around powerful analytics and marketing tools, Web3 builders are now developing their own data-driven growth engines to meet their unique needs.\n\nTorque is one such product, providing a powerful onchain-native growth platform, enabling just-in-time user rewards based on a wide variety of behaviors. Prominent teams like Tensor and Metaplex already use Torque for targeted growth campaigns. Meanwhile AdX, a team in our latest accelerator cohort, is building a decentralized ad exchange, granting both Web 2 and Web 3 projects direct access to effective distribution channels.\n\nHigh-performance Clients\n\nCurrently, Solana‚Äôs network relies on two main node clients: Anza‚Äôs Agave and Jump‚Äôs Firedancer, the latter of which hasn‚Äôt been fully deployed yet. The Firedancer team has taken on the ambitious (and critical) effort of building a new client from the ground up, with a focus on high-performance. While we believe this will be a successful effort over the coming years, we also believe there are sustainable opportunities for monetizing more tightly-scoped validator improvements even sooner.¬†\n\nRakurai, a team of experienced engineers from Apple and high-frequency trading, are capitalizing on one such opportunity. Building on upcoming Agave releases, their validator client will integrate an optimized transaction scheduler that has benchmarked at up to 5x the current block rewards and yield boosts of over 30% compared to existing clients. We anticipate a continued increase in competition amongst validator operators, leading to better network performance for apps and users in the years to come.\n\nCrypto Developer Tooling\n\nAs crypto matures, development teams require increasingly advanced tooling to secure, monitor, and scale their products. In traditional tech, tools like HashiCorp‚Äôs Terraform made cloud infrastructure management far simpler and more reliable for engineers. In crypto, Txtx is poised to offer similarly transformative infrastructure‚Äîimproving security, reliability, and reproducibility of workflows involving onchain programs/smart contracts.\n\nFor monitoring and rapid bug resolution, Tokamai has also emerged as a crypto-native equivalent to Sentry, empowering developers to maintain application reliability through every layer of the stack.\n\nOnchain Yield\n\nWhile DeFi has introduced overcollateralized lending, capital-efficient yield remains elusive. The next phase of DeFi will bring more sophisticated yield markets onchain, enabled through true prime brokerage-like functionality and liquid staking fundamentals.\n\nAsgard is laying this groundwork by building a suite of DeFi protocols, including a spot margin aggregator and credit synthesizer. Pye, another hackathon winner, is creating a marketplace that allows stakers to tokenize and forward-sell their staking yield‚Äîfurther extending the frontier of DeFi 2.0.\n\nThe final team we backed in this vertical is Watt, which is building a volatility farming protocol utilizing market arbitrage to generate real yield for users and foster liquidity for the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nPrivate DeFi Infrastructure\n\nTransparency is a defining feature of DeFi, yet certain market participants prefer selective privacy. PayPal‚Äôs integration of confidential transactions using token extensions for its PYUSD stablecoin highlights a growing demand for privacy-enhanced financial infrastructure.\n\nWe believe this foreshadows in a new era of embedded privacy primitives for DeFi. Darklake, a recent hackathon standout, employs zero-knowledge proofs to create a privacy-first dark pool trading platform.\n\nSports Markets\n\nSports are rapidly financializing: stadiums are integrating casinos, online betting is thriving, and college athletes are now receiving substantial compensation. Crypto is poised to expand and democratize these markets‚Äîenabling direct ownership, unique betting models, and new forms of engagement.\n\nIn our newest accelerator cohort, AlphaFC is pioneering the tokenization of sports fandom through real ownership of an English football club, and Pregame is building a new platform for direct p2p sports betting. We're excited to watch both of these endeavors expand crypto‚Äôs role in the sports economy.\n\nVirtual Infrastructure Networks\n\nDeVINs (Decentralized Virtual Infrastructure Networks) gained momentum in 2024 and we continue to see top founder talent launch a diversity of products in the space.\n\nBlockMesh empowers users to earn passive income by leveraging their unused bandwidth, and is well on their way to building a strong network with over 500,000 extension downloads.¬† Meanwhile, MeshMap is focused on building a 3D AR mapping network. Although mainstream AR/VR adoption is still in its infancy, we anticipate accelerated growth in these areas over the next 1-2 years. Finally, we also backed DBunker, which is an aggregator and marketplace giving users the ability to participate across many DeVINs.\n\nEnergy Markets\n\nRising global energy demand and increasing climate pressures create volatility and opportunity. Southeast Asia, in particular, has seen high demand for innovative solutions to support a growing population with an aging energy grid. We‚Äôve backed 2 India-based teams who are building novel token-incentivized infrastructure to serve this demand.\n\nDeCharge has deployed over 150 EV charging stations within just a few months, and is expanding to the U.S. in Q1 2025, and GreenkWh is using battery packs to coordinate off-grid energy‚Äîboth projects exemplify how crypto can reshape global energy infrastructure.\n\nSocial Markets\n\nAfter a 2024 boom in memecoins, founders are now exploring deeper integrations of social media, token issuance, and gaming. The following teams are exploring use cases across a spectrum of community engagement to gamified token economies:\n\nBanger: An app that enables users to buy and sell ‚Äútweet tokens,‚Äù Curators to profit from high-volume tweet markets, and Creators to earn for their viral posts.\nPeek: A platform that leverages liquid crypto markets to gamify TikTok videos and content.\nSupersize: A Mini-clip style gaming platform building an onchain PVP game where token communities wager and compete for dominance to become the largest ‚Äúblob‚Äù on the map.\nMonsters: A new game for memecoin communities, blending Pok√©mon-inspired mechanics with high-stakes betting.\nTeamplay (with Midcurve): A platform for creators to host private gaming sessions and contests, tightening community engagement and opening new revenue streams through a token-enhancing toolkit.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs we prepare to run more hackathons for the Solana ecosystem in 2025, we‚Äôre eager to learn from the next generation of founders and support the creation of novel crypto markets. One emerging force we‚Äôre closely examining is AI weaving its way into crypto landscape. While we don‚Äôt view AI as a standalone use case, we do see it as a transformative layer that will enhance all verticals.\n\nSign up at colosseum.org to get notified about our upcoming hackathons‚Äîwe can‚Äôt wait to see what you build next!",

    "content": "gm! This will be the last newsletter of 2024 since I'm going to be enjoying some time off to celebrate the holidays üéÑ\n\nIf 2024 was any sign of what the future holds for Solana, 2025 is going to be even better. I'm glad I'm on this ride with you and I can't wait to kick off the new year and to keep bringing you everything you need to know to build on Solana!\n\nNow, let's take a look at what üéÖ has in his bag for all you good developers‚Ä¶\n\nüîå Electric Capital Developer Report\n\nFor the first time Solana has overtaken Ethereum as the #1 blockchain for new developers, according to Electric Capital's 2024 Developer Report.¬†\n\nOut of 39,000 developers exploring crypto this year, over 7,600 chose to build on Solana. This marks an 83% year-over-year increase in new developer activity for the Solana ecosystem.\n\nSolana has built momentum over the past year, even through price volatility and market cycles, and the work is starting to show.¬†\n\nThe report highlights a few overlooked wins for Solana:\n\nSolana handled 81% of all DEX transactions across all blockchains this year.\nIt surpassed Ethereum in total DEX settlement volume, hitting $574 billion for the year.\nAdoption is scaling quickly where 1.7 million unique wallets transacted on Solana in 2024, 7x more than any other chain.\n\nWhile Ethereum remains the largest ecosystem overall and continues to dominate in total active developers, Solana‚Äôs growth signals where the next generation of builders is headed.¬†\n\nThe report also points to a larger global trend of developer activity spreading out across continents, with Asia leading the way.¬†\n\nIndia, in particular, onboarded the most new crypto developers this year, and Solana is now the top ecosystem for developers in the region.\n\nFor Solana developers, this is validation. The ecosystem is thriving and attracting more builders and real-world adoption than ever.\n\nSolana overthrows Ethereum‚Äôs 8-year reign as top ecosystem for new devs\n\nüßô Anza Research\n\nAnza has launched a cutting-edge research team, spearheaded by renowned distributed systems expert Professor Roger Wattenhofer and his two PhD students, Kobi Sliwinski and Quentin Kniep, from ETH Zurich.¬†\n\nTheir goal is to elevate Solana‚Äôs protocol with a deeply academic approach.\n\nKey Areas of Focus:\nDesigning a more performant and provably correct turbine-based consensus algorithm.\nEnhancing latency, resilience, and network economics.\nAddressing adversarial behavior in distributed systems to ensure state-of-the-art resilience.\n\nThis team‚Äôs academic rigor and experience in distributed systems, Rust programming, and major blockchain projects like Dfinity, Sui, Ethereum, and Algorand position them to bring unexplored improvements to Solana.\n\nAnza Research: A New Chapter for Solana‚Äôs Protocol\n\nüìÖ Solana Events in 2025\n\nThe Solana Foundation is prioritizing Community-led events that bring together developers, founders, validators, product managers, and strategists to build, iterate, and connect in ways that drive actual results.\n\nThe schedule for 2025 includes several key opportunities for developers.\n\nIn May, two flagship events in New York City will anchor the American crypto scene, starting with a highly selective, application-only conference for those deeply engaged in building on Solana.\n\nThis event will be followed by a larger conference welcoming the U.S. crypto industry as a whole and introducing a new audience to what's happening in the Solana ecosystem.\n\nAround the world, APEX events will take place in major cities like Mexico City, Cape Town, Budapest, Singapore, and Mumbai, each designed to highlight high-quality applications tailored to local communities.\n\nStartup Villages, inspired by the success of gatherings like mtnDAO, will provide extended periods for developers and entrepreneurs to work together, refine products, participate in workshops, and form lasting connections.\n\nCommunity-led hacker houses and independent conferences will continue to offer spaces for builders to meet, experiment, and share knowledge.\n\nFinally, Breakpoint 2025 in Abu Dhabi remains the ultimate moment for the ecosystem, bringing the global Solana community together to celebrate achievements and set the course for the future.\n\nGather to Build: Solana Foundation Events in 2025\n\nüé© MagicBlock Ephemeral Validator\n\nMagicBlock has open-sourced the MagicBlock Ephemeral Validator, a lightweight, non-voting SVM runtime designed to replace traditional Web2 servers.\n\nEphemeral Validators work by cloning accounts just-in-time within ultra-fast SVM instances, executing tasks, and updating the mainnet state upon completion.\n\nThe validator enables real-time, elastic computing directly on Solana, eliminating the need for centralized servers by implementing application logic entirely on-chain.\n\nThe core innovation lies in Ephemeral Rollups, which extend Solana by offering serverless, elastic compute.\n\nThis allows for fully on-chain real-time applications, such as gaming, decentralized social networks, and high-frequency finance, while maintaining all smart contract logic and state on Solana.\n\nThis open-source release marks the beginning of a multi-month effort to fully develop and open-source MagicBlock.\n\nOpen Sourcing the MagicBlock Ephemeral Validator\n\n‚ö° Quick Hits\n\nSubmissions for the Solana AI Hackathon are now LIVE until 11:59 PM EST, Dec 23rd - @sendaifun\n\nWhy Web3 Communities Need More Than Just Financial Incentives - Harkness Institute from Turbin3\n\nSolana DePIN Quickstart Guide for Founders - Solana\n\nSolana Consensus - From Forks to Finality - Neodyme\n\nUsing ZKPs on Solana with the SP1 Solana Verifier - Succinct\n\nSVM Merklization on SOON - Soon SVM\n\nThe Rebirth of Privacy on Solana - Arcium\n\nIntroducing Fuse Off-Ramp - Fuse\n\nCurated shortlist of Solana ZK Compression resources - @swen_sjn\n\nCollecting the Price of Everything: Introducing Pyth Energy Feeds - Pyth\n\n‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Resources\n\nanchor-escrow-2025 is an Anchor example of a Solana Escrow program.\n\nsuper-smart-contracts provides a simple example of a Super Smart Contract using OpenAI API to respond to queries that can interact with users, learn from them, and adapt to their needs.¬†\n\nsolana-test-validator is a Docker image for the Solana Test Validator built each night for linux/amd64 as well as linux/arm64 platform with nightly builds from the latest version of Agave client.\n\nidl-program is an IDL solution for native Solana programs that leverages a metadata program instead of requiring an empty Anchor program.

    "content": "üî± Poseidon\n\nPoseidon is a new framework developed by Turbin3 that enables developers to write and deploy on-chain Solana programs using TypeScript, a language familiar to millions worldwide.¬†\n\nAt its core, Poseidon bridges the gap between TypeScript and Rust, the primary language for Solana development.¬†\n\nDevelopers can write their programs in TS, leveraging its robust type system and familiar syntax. Poseidon's transpilation engine then converts this TypeScript code into equivalent Anchor code.¬†\n\nThis translation allows developers to deploy their applications on the Solana blockchain without the need to master Rust, accelerating the development process and reducing the learning curve associated with Solana's complex account models.\n\nPoseidon is great for getting started fast, but if you're aiming to build complex on-chain protocols, you might still need to get familiar with Rust and other Solana-native tools.\n\nPoseidon could be a game-changer for developers curious about Solana but intimidated by its steep learning curve.¬†\n\nUltimately, Poseidon is here to bring more developers into the Solana community by making development more accessible. This means you can achieve those first big wins, like deploying your first on-chain program, much quicker.\n\nIntroducing Poseidon Framework from Turbin3: Write Solana Programs in Typescript\n\nüêß Pudgy Penguins launch $PENGU on Solana\n\nPudgy Penguins, one of the top NFT collections on Ethereum, is set to launch its native token $PENGU on Solana.\n\nI had the opportunity to interview Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz just prior to the announcement and he shared details on why Solana was the obvious choice for the launch.¬†\n\nThe decision to launch PENGU on Solana stems from Solana's superior consumer experience and technical capabilities.\n\n‚ÄúWhen you're looking at what we're trying to optimize for, which is bringing our millions of fans into the space, it's hard to refute that Solana is the best consumer experience today.‚Äù¬† ~ Luca Netz\n\nThe scalability and performance of Solana also align perfectly with Pudgy Penguins‚Äô vision of supporting extensive integrations and future growth without compromising on speed or reliability.\n\nThe introduction of the PENGU token opens up opportunities for Solana developers too.¬†\n\n‚ÄúAnything and everything consumer is really what we're trying to position. If you‚Äôre leveraging the IP or using the token to integrate with NFT marketplaces or other consumer applications, we‚Äôd be excited.‚Äù ~ Luca Netz\n\nDevelopers can integrate the PENGU token into various (dApps, including NFT marketplaces, DeFi platforms, gaming environments, and consumer-focused apps such as wallets, payment gateways, and loyalty programs that can leverage the token‚Äôs functionalities.\n\nSolana‚Äôs vibrant and active developer community provides a platform for Pudgy Penguins to expand its already dynamic community.¬†\n\n‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about one chain over the other. It‚Äôs about building bridges and enabling everyone to participate.‚Äù ~ Luca Netz\n\nIn addition to technical advantages, Solana‚Äôs strong ecosystem provides Pudgy Penguins the tools and infrastructure to bridge the gap between digital and physical with major retailers and expand their physical product lines.\n\nTop NFT Brand Pudgy Penguins to Release PENGU Token on Solana\n\nüìú Solana Web3.js 2.0\n\nSolana‚Äôs Web3.js 2.0 is a game-changer for developers, making the development process smoother and more efficient.¬†\n\nThe modular architecture of Web3.js 2.0 is a significant upgrade.¬†Instead of having one massive library, functionalities are broken down into independent packages.\n\nWhether you need RPC communication, transaction handling, account decoding, or error identification, you can pick and choose the exact modules you need.¬†\n\nWeb3.js 2.0 introduces leak-resistant keys, ensuring that if you accidentally log or store your private keys, only metadata is exposed, not the actual key bytes.¬†\n\nIt also taps into native WebCrypto for signing operations, reducing reliance on third-party dependencies and boosting overall security.\n\nCustomization is also easier with the new SDK.¬†You can add custom RPC methods and transport strategies tailored to your specific needs.¬†\n\nWhether you want to implement a fallback to a secondary RPC server, throttle API calls to manage rate limits, or employ a round-robin approach for load balancing, Web3.js 2.0 provides the flexibility to do so.\n\nTo get yourself familiar with all the changes and updates in v2.0, check out these in-depth guides from Helius and Triton One for everything you need to know to get started:\n\nHow to Start Building with the Solana Web3.js 2.0 SDK\n\nIntro to the new @solana/web3.js

This module allows you to integrate advanced banking features tailored to your application's needs.\nNetworking: Simplifies the handling of transactions on the Solana network. It abstracts lower-level blockchain interactions, enabling you to focus on building application functionalities without worrying about transaction details.\n\nBy utilizing the Squads API, you can enhance your applications with stablecoin functionalities seamlessly.\n\nThis integration broadens the scope of services you offer and positions your application to take advantage of stablecoin efficiencies, including low transaction fees, instant settlements, and global accessibility.\n\nSome potential Use Cases include:\n\nWallets that can implement features like sub-accounts, spending limits, escrow services, and recurring payments.¬†\nPayroll and Remittance Platforms to enable global payroll and remittances with instant cross-border payments at low cost.\nEcommerce Platforms that support secure, instant payments and escrow functionality.¬†\nPayment Service Providers (PSPs) with stablecoin payments directly integrated into the platform.¬†\n\nThe Squads API offers Solana developers¬† simplified development, enhanced security, and improved user experience.\n\nIntroducing Squads API\n\nüí∞ Solana Inflation Rates\n\nThere has been some conversation around making an adjustment to Solana's inflation mechanism to better align with network participation and security goals.\n\nThe main objective is to adjust the inflation rate based on the percentage of SOL tokens staked, encouraging more than 50% of the circulating supply to be actively staked.\n\nThis dynamic inflation mechanism is designed to enhance network security by ensuring that validators remain economically viable to maximize decentralization.\n\nUnder the proposed system, the inflation rate would start at the current rate of 4.8% and could adjust upwards or downwards at the beginning of each epoch. If more than 50% of the total SOL supply is staked, the inflation rate would decrease by 0.1%.\n\nConversely, if less than 50% is staked, the inflation rate would increase by 0.1%. This adjustment would continue each epoch, with the inflation rate bounded between a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 4.8%.\n\nThe motivation behind this change is to reduce reliance on inflation for rewarding validators and stakers, as validators are increasingly earning revenue from sources like MEV and priority fees.\n\nWhile it'll be a wihle before any adjustment to Solana's inflation rate is implemented, it's worth keeping an eye on this discussion as it has a big impact on the future of Solana.\n\nSIMD proposal: Updating Solana inflation rate\n\n‚ö° Quick Hits\n\n10 must-have resources for developers diving into the Solana ecosystem - @AmalnathSathyan\n\nOverview of Solana‚Äôs Technology and its Implications for Gaming (Video) - Superteam Vietnam\n\nMPL-404 developer docs get a full rewrite - Metaplex\n\nHow to Write Good and The Importance of Technical Writing (Video) - Ackee Blockchain Security\n\nChase Barker is stepping down from the Solana Foundation - @therealchaseeb\n\n‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Resources\n\nsologger is a group of libraries and binaries that can be used to parse raw logs emitted from a Solana RPC into structured logs and transport Solana logs to either a LogStash or OpenTelemetry endpoint via TCP.\n\nCarbon is a lightweight indexing framework on Solana that provides a modular pipeline for sourcing data, decoding updates, and processing them in order to build end-to-end indexers.\n\nexample-jupiter-swap-node is an example of a Jupiter Swap with Compressed Tokens that enables a single swap transaction that includes additional instructions for creating, decompressing, and closing the input token account.\n\nüë©‚Äçüîß Get Hired\nDouro Labs is hiring a Frontend Engineer to help design and develop tools for staking, governance, and administration within the Pyth Network ecosystem.\nZotto is hiring a Solana Backend Engineer to develop and maintain backend infrastructure for Solana.\nüéß Listen to This\nCivic\n\nIn this episode, Karthik M., Co-Founder of Honeycomb Protocol, discusses the rapidly advancing world of Web3 gaming and the groundbreaking experiences it offers through emerging technologies like tokenized identity.¬†\n\nKarthik explains how Web3 gaming differs from traditional Web2 gaming, particularly in terms of user experience, monetization, and community-building opportunities.\n\nHe emphasizes the unique possibilities available to game developers, encouraging them to focus on areas like tokenized identities and immersive, interactive experiences.¬†\n\nThe discussion also looks into Honeycomb‚Äôs partnership with Civic, highlighting how Civic's identity verification platform is being leveraged to enhance the gaming ecosystem.¬†\n\nKarthik also shares Honeycomb's future plans, which aim to further redefine the potential of Web3 gaming.\n\nIdentity as the Ultimate Cheat Code in Web3 Gaming with Karthik M. of Honeycomb Protocol\n\nBonus Episodes\n\nHow Chris is Increasing Bandwidth and Reducing Latency (IBRL) On Solana with TitanDex - Solana Weekly\n\nThis episode dives into the cutting-edge development of TitanDex, a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator building liquidity aggregation on Solana.\n\nSolana's Mobile Future w/ Andrew, DRiP.haus Mobile Engineer - Solfate\n\nThis conversation explores various aspects of mobile development, particularly in the context of the Drip app and Solana's mobile initiatives, the differences between web and mobile app development, the importance of user experience, and the challenges faced in the blockchain space.\n\nChris Zhu | Building In-Game Economies with Sonic SVM - BlockHash\n\nSonic CEO & Co-founder Chris Zhu joins Brandon Zemp to discuss Sonic SVM and how they are enabling sovereign game economies that roll-up to Solana, customized VM agnostic game engines, and Sonic‚Äôs vision is to expand the existing Solana Gaming Ecosystem.\n\nFollow¬†@mikehale¬†on X or Warpcast!\n\nThanks for reading ‚úåÔ∏è\n\nI hope you found something useful here!

    "content": "üöÄ Colosseum Accelerator Cohort 2\n\nColosseum's second accelerator cohort features 13 standout startups from the Solana Radar Hackathon.¬†\n\nOut of 1,359 submissions and 39 prize winners, these teams stood out for their technical talent, vision, and drive. Each is now set up to build projects that will push the Solana ecosystem forward.\n\nThe teams selected (in no particular order) are:¬†\n\nGreenKWh: An off-grid DePIN network promoting decentralized renewable energy while balancing grid load during peak usage.\nAlphaFC: Gives football fans a real stake in their favorite clubs through tokens for key decisions like scouting, trades, and team management.\nDarklake: Bringing Wall Street efficiency to DeFi with lightning-fast, private, and MEV-resistant trades leveraging privacy-preserving execution powered by ZKPs.\nSupersize: An io-style game enabling players to experience real-time, fully on-chain, high-stakes multiplayer gaming.\nTokamai: Catches development errors before your users do through real-time monitoring and alerting for Solana programs.\nTxtx: Takes away the stress and complexity of onchain infrastructure management with secure, robust, and reproducible blocks of code called Runbooks.\nThe Arena: A fast-paced PVP trading game leveraging decentralized exchanges and novel socialfi mechanics.\nReflect Protocol: A DeFi protocol powering a novel hedge-backed, delta-neutral stablecoin on Solana.\nHylo: Building a new yield-bearing DeFi protocol that enables an autonomous, dual-token stablecoin system backed by Solana LSTs.\nTrenches.top: A platform to tokenize the reputation of alpha callers on Solana, unlocking new forms of competition and social speculation, while rewarding the most deserving callers.\nAdX: A next-generation decentralized ad exchange and network enabling real-time (encrypted blind auction) bidding to serve targeted digital ads.\nWatt Protocol: A volatility farming protocol using natural market arbitrage to generate real yield for users and foster liquidity for assets in the ecosystem.\nPregame: A P2P sports wagering app that lets users bet against anyone online in a trustless manner.\n\nDuring the 8-week program, these founders will move from devnet to mainnet, iterating, testing, and refining their products along the way.¬†\n\nThe program concludes with a private demo day for investors, followed by a public release of the event recording for the wider crypto community.\n\nIntroducing Colosseum Accelerator Cohort 2\n\nüìä Messari Solana Portal\n\nMessari's Solana Portal brings together all the data and insights you need to understand Solana‚Äôs ecosystem.¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs more than a data dashboard. It‚Äôs a resource that combines real-time metrics with curated insights to help users make informed decisions about Solana‚Äôs network.¬†¬†\n\nüí¨\nWe wanted to go beyond just showing numbers. The Portal includes qualitative insights so users can see the bigger picture of what‚Äôs happening across the ecosystem. Whether you‚Äôre tracking market data, keeping up with new projects, or monitoring on-chain activity, it‚Äôs all in one place.¬†\n~ Messari CEO Eric Turner\n\nThe Solana Portal simplifies this process by bringing everything into one platform, designed to work for anyone involved in the ecosystem.¬†¬†\n\nHere‚Äôs what you‚Äôll find:¬†¬†\n\nQualitative Insights¬†¬†\n\nProject Recaps: Quick summaries of updates, research, and reports covering the past week, month, or quarter.¬†\nKey Updates: Real-time tracking and summaries of important events‚Äîon-chain and off-chain.\nNews & Media: An aggregated feed of news, videos, and podcasts from 500+ sources, with brief AI-generated summaries.¬†\nQuarterly Reports: Regular reports showcasing growth metrics, developments, and on-chain activity.¬†\nAnnouncements: Official updates in one convenient place.¬†¬†\n\n6. Resource Hub: A collection of documentation and useful links for the community.¬†¬†\n\nQuantitative Data¬†¬†\n\nNetwork Metrics: Data on active addresses, transaction volumes, fees, DeFi metrics (like TVL and DEX volume), and smart contracts.\nMarket Data: Price feeds, trading volume, and other market trends.\nStatements: Structured reports that package key metrics into a traditional quarterly statement format.\nToken Unlocks: Details on vesting schedules, allocations, and upcoming unlock events.¬†\nFundraising Insights: Information about fundraising activities, including rounds and key investors.¬†¬†\n\nBy combining qualitative and quantitative insights, it makes it easier to find the information you need to make better decisions, whether you‚Äôre building, investing, or just learning.¬†\n\nMessari Solana Portal\n\nüèóÔ∏è Verifiable Builds\n\nVerifiable Builds on Solana ensures that the programs running on-chain are identical to their publicly available source code.¬†\n\nBy using deterministic builds and cryptographic verification, developers can prove the authenticity of their deployed programs, fostering trust within the ecosystem.\n\nFor developers, Verifiable Builds streamline the process of maintaining open-source transparency.¬†\n\nTools like solana-verify-build make it easy to build, deploy, and verify programs, seamlessly integrating into CI/CD pipelines.¬†\n\nThis eliminates the risk of tampering during deployment and demonstrates a commitment to security and openness. The ability to publicly verify program integrity not only strengthens the credibility of development teams but also reinforces user confidence.\n\nFrom a user perspective, Verifiable Builds enhance trust in the applications they interact with.¬†\n\nKnowing that a program's code is publicly auditable and matches its on-chain version provides reassurance about its functionality and security. This transparency aligns with the decentralized ethos of Web3, promoting greater adoption and collaboration across the Solana ecosystem.\n\nVerifiable Builds bridge the gap between developers and users, creating a more open, secure, and trustworthy environment for decentralized innovation.\n\nHow to Verify a Program\n\nüåü Measuring Solana‚Äôs Decentralization\n\nThe Solana Decentralization Report from Helius is a comprehensive analysis that examines various facets of decentralization, aiming to provide factual, data-driven insights for developers, stakeholders, and the broader community.\n\nThe main goal of the report is to assess Solana's decentralization across multiple dimensions, addressing criticisms and misconceptions about the network's structure and resilience.¬†\n\nIt highlights areas where Solana excels in decentralization and identifies opportunities for further improvement.\n\nThe Solana network is currently operating with a total of 4,514 nodes across 37 countries and territories. This includes 1,414 validators and 3,100 RPC nodes. One of the standout points is that no single validator controls more than 3.2% of the total stake.¬†\n\nThe largest concentration is in the United States, with 508 validators, which is about 37% of the total. Other significant locations include the Netherlands, the UK, and Germany.¬†\n\nClient diversity is crucial for the health of any blockchain network. Solana initially launched with a single validator client, but efforts have been made to increase diversity in this area.¬†\n\nThe main client, Agave, is a fork of the original Solana Labs client and is written in Rust. It has a robust development community with 357 individual contributors.\n\nWe also have Firedancer, a new client developed by Jump Crypto, which is a complete rewrite of the validator client in the C programming language.¬†\n\nAlthough it's relatively new, it already has 57 contributors. Firedancer aims to improve performance and add redundancy to the network.\n\nThen there's Jito, a client that currently holds an 88% share of the network's stake. Jito is a fork of Agave and includes an out-of-protocol block space auction mechanism.¬†\n\nHowever, this dominance is expected to change as Firedancer and other clients like Frankendancer and Sig are gradually introduced and integrated into the ecosystem.¬†\n\nThe developer community around Solana is vibrant and globally distributed. The most recent Radar hackathon attracted 13,672 participants from 156 countries.¬†\n\nDespite the positive strides, the report highlights several areas where Solana could improve its decentralization:\n\nValidator Concentration: There's a notable concentration of validators and stake in the U.S. and EU.¬†\nHosting Provider Diversity: With two hosting providers accounting for nearly half of the stake, there's a risk associated with potential outages or policy changes from these providers.¬†\nClient Dominance: The Jito client currently dominates the network's stake. While this client has its advantages, such dominance means that any issues with Jito could have widespread impacts. The introduction of Firedancer and other clients should help balance this out.\nCost Barriers: The costs associated with running a validator, particularly voting costs and data egress fees, are significant. This is especially challenging for operators outside the EU and U.S., where costs can be higher.¬†\nGovernance Participation: While governance processes are in place, increasing active participation in governance voting could enhance decentralization.¬†\n\nOverall, the report paints a positive picture of Solana's current state of decentralization.¬†\n\nSolana compares favorably to other blockchains in several key metrics, including stake distribution, geographical spread, and developer community engagement.¬†\n\nMeasuring Solana‚Äôs Decentralization: Facts and Figures\n\nüîí Anza Invalidator Team\n\nThe Invalidator Team at Anza is taking Solana's resilience to the next level with a redhat approach to adversarial testing.¬†\n\nAfter the February 2024 outage underscored the need for deeper stress-testing, this small but scrappy team has been hard at work designing attacks that push Solana‚Äôs limits beyond what it might face in the wild.¬†\n\nTheir goal? To break the network so developers can fix it before anyone else tries.\n\nThe team‚Äôs work covers everything from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks to economic stress testing and even simulations of packet loss or delay.¬†\n\nThey‚Äôre not just targeting one validator client like Agave (which Anza develops) but testing vulnerabilities across the board, including Firedancer, so the entire ecosystem benefits from these brutal but essential exercises.\n\nA particularly interesting area is their work on creating synthetic loads that mirror real-world transactions, helping ensure the network can handle complex activity as it evolves.¬†\n\nThey‚Äôve also made strides in slashing development, using adversarial nodes to prove that misbehavior can be detected and punished effectively.\n\nUltimately, the Invalidator Team‚Äôs mission is about keeping Solana ahead of the curve, building a network that‚Äôs robust enough to thrive under pressure, no matter what‚Äôs thrown at it.\n\nStrengthening Solana: The Invalidator Team\n\nüåâ Bridge to Turbin3\n\nBridge to Turbin3 is a free, two-week online program from Rise In designed to prepare you for Turbin3, one of the top Solana developer bootcamps.\n\nThrough this prep course, you'll strengthen your skills in Rust, Typescript, and the Solana ecosystem while earning a special \"Rise In\" certificate.\n\nThe application process is straightforward: apply online, complete onboarding steps, pass pre-selection, and join the kick-off event to start your Web3 journey.\n\nBridge to Turbin3\n\n‚ö° Quick Hits\n\nSolana Changelog Nov 20 -

I'm not saying that to knock either platform, attendees have probably just heard more about Solana going into the event, but it does show the high level of interest in Solana.¬†\n\nColosseum made a contribution too as Nate Levine talked about student onboarding through hackathons, how some of the biggest projects got started on Solana, and how the Colosseum Hackathons and Accelerator help launch new projects.¬†\n\nI did feel just a bit out of place as the \"old guy\" at an event aimed at college students, but I got to meet a lot of great people and become even more bullish on Solana seeing the next generation of builders learning and working together!\n\nUMich hosts inaugural Midwest Blockchain Conference\n\nüç¥ Minimum Fork Viability\n\nMinimum Fork Viability (MFV) is a framework focused on building projects that aren‚Äôt just usable products but act as robust, adaptable foundations for future innovation.¬†\n\nFor Solana developers, MFV is about creating applications or protocols with the infrastructure, clarity, and flexibility needed to allow other teams to fork or build upon them effectively.¬†\n\nMFV shifts the goal from simply creating an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) to developing a foundation that others can extend, modify, or even reimagine.\n\nIt‚Äôs not just about making a functioning project but about designing it with future builders in mind. For Solana developers, this means creating dApps, protocols, and tools that can be easily forked, improved, and adapted, contributing to the overall health and growth of the Solana ecosystem.\n\nSolana‚Äôs thriving developer community benefits when projects can be forked and adapted, creating an environment of rapid innovation.¬†\n\nForkable projects allow developers to customize for niche needs, improve upon core innovations, and contribute to a shared ecosystem.¬†\n\nBy providing detailed documentation and adhering to Solana‚Äôs best practices, you help other developers understand your contributions and make it easier for them to build upon your work.\n\nBy focusing on extensibility, robust documentation, clear architecture, and community engagement, Solana projects can become cornerstones of innovation within the ecosystem.¬†\n\nMinimum Fork Viability: The Foundation for Compounding Innovation\n\n‚ö° Quick Hits\n\nSolana Congestion: How to Best Send Solana Transactions - Helius\n\nWhy is Governance on Solana winning? - @Realms_DAOs\n\nIntroducing A New Pricing Plan For Squads App - Squads\n\nNew testnet SVM feature to allow onchain programs to invoke other programs how user transactions invoke programs - @jstrry\n\nLoop Crypto (payments) is live on Solana - Loop Crypto\n\nThe Graph Workshop (Video) - @solana_devs\n\nAnchoring Economies: The Role of Stablecoins in Emerging Markets - Squads Research\n\nSolana upgrades software as validators see fortunes shift - Lightspeed\n\n‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Resources\n\nsolfees.io is a dashboard to watch Solana blocks in real-time including Compute Units & Priority Fees.\n\nVelos is a fast, lightweight client for streaming Solana data that reduces infrastructure costs through efficient decoupling of the data reception layer.\n\nnative-fundraiser is a Fundraiser program example for Solana written in native Rust.\n\nValid8 is a Solana validator package manager that lets you clone accounts, manage packages and test your programs locally with a user friendly page that can be your very own Solana Validator Package Manager.\n\nmetaplex-nextjs-tailwind-shadcn-template a reusable UI template that utilizes Nextjs and Tailwind for the front end framework while also being preinstalled with Metaplex Umi, Solana WalletAdapter, and Zustand global store for ease of use.\n\nüë©‚Äçüîß Get Hired\nJito Labs is hiring a Senior Software Engineer and a Software Engineer - Data & Tools to build critical, next-generation infrastructure for the Solana ecosystem.\nPhantom is hiring an Engineering Manager to guide the development of infrastructure across web, mobile, backend and data engineering.\nComposable Foundation is hiring a Solana Engineer to lead the development of smart contracts and dApps on Solana.\nTriton is hiring a Senior Backend and Infrastructure Developer to build high-performance¬†software infrastructure.\nüìÖ Event Calendar\nAllmight has announced the VIP Social Mixer Tour in NYC, Miami, Chicago, Denver, and San Francisco.

The share of founders who are building on or interested in Solana grew to 11.2% this year, up from 5.1% last year‚Äîthe largest increase among all blockchains.\n\nWhile Ethereum still leads with 20.8% of total builder interest, Solana's growth rate suggests a narrowing gap and highlights the network's appeal to developers seeking high-performance platforms.\n\nSeveral major themes from the report resonate with the developments within the Solana ecosystem:\n\nCrypto Activity and Adoption: Global crypto usage is at an all-time high, with mobile wallet users reaching 29 million in June 2024. The growth is not confined to traditional markets; countries like Nigeria, India, and Argentina are experiencing significant adoption due to factors like currency devaluation and increasing mobile penetration.\n\nPolitical Engagement: Crypto has emerged as a key political issue ahead of the U.S. election, with increased interest observed in swing states. Regulatory milestones, such as the approval of Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded products and the passage of the FIT21 Act, indicate growing governmental engagement with the crypto sector.\n\nStablecoins and Payments: Stablecoins have found a strong product-market fit, facilitating fast, low-cost global transactions. In Q2 2024, stablecoins processed $8.5 trillion in transactions, surpassing traditional payment networks like Visa.\n\nInfrastructure Advancements: Technological improvements have significantly increased blockchain capacity while reducing transaction costs. For Solana, known for its high throughput and low fees, these advancements reinforce its position as an attractive platform for developers.\n\nGrowth of DeFi: Decentralized finance continues to expand, offering alternatives to traditional financial systems. With over $169 billion locked in DeFi protocols across blockchains, there's a growing opportunity for developers to innovate in areas like staking, lending, and decentralized exchanges on Solana's network.\n\nCrypto and AI Intersection: The report highlights how blockchain technology can address challenges in artificial intelligence, such as verifying data authenticity, democratizing access to computational resources, and ensuring transparent, user-owned services.\n\nEmergence of New Applications: Enhanced scalability has unlocked a wave of new on-chain applications. The evolution of NFTs from speculative assets to components of social collecting experiences illustrates this shift.

    "content": "Breakpoint has come to a close, and sadly I was watching along from home feeling some serious FOMO!\n\nThe biggest note from this year's Breakpoint was a focus on products vs. infrastructure/tooling. Don't worry, there were plenty of goodies for devs too!\n\nSome of the main themes, as noted by 0xrwu of Tensor, were cross-chain swaps, stablecoins & payments, embedded wallets, and DePIN. There was also a lot of big news around Mobile and real-world apps.¬†\n\nOverall, the sentiment around Breakpoint is excitement about the future of Solana!\n\nIf you weren't able to attend, or you were too busy making new connections, all of the session videos are available online to get you caught up:¬†\n\nBreakpoint 2024: All Talks\n\nHere's the rest of the news for Solana developers‚Ä¶\n\nüåü Metaplex Aura\n\nMetaplex has launched Aura, a decentralized indexing and data availability network designed to extend the Solana ecosystem and SVM.\n\nAura provides developers with enhanced tools for building dApps by solving key challenges like data retrieval and scalability.\n\nAura is powered by $MPLX and operates through a network of decentralized nodes that handle indexing and data storage in real-time.\n\nIt features three core components:\n\nData Availability for Digital Assets: Ensures that assets and media are accessible at all times, even when compressed, using decentralized storage solutions to eliminate reliance on a single point of failure.\nMulti-Program Consistent Indexing: Offers high-performance indexing across the Solana network and SVM, improving how data is retrieved and displayed across multiple programs.\nElastic State Management: Developers can compress and decompress asset data efficiently, transitioning assets between SVM account space and different levels of state compression. This optimizes performance and reduces costs, especially when managing high transaction volumes.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of Metaplex Aura is its ability to improve scalability. Developers can manage millions of assets with far fewer transactions, thanks to Aura's compressed state management.\n\nThis reduction in transaction volume not only reduces network traffic, but also lowers costs, making it easier for developers to build applications to handle large-scale user bases without compromising on performance.\n\nWith elastic state management, developers can transition assets between SVM account space and various levels of state compression, letting data adapt to the changing needs of their apps.\n\nAura is a community-driven project that was developed with feedback from over 25 different projects, including NFT marketplaces, infrastructure providers, and game developers.\n\nLaunch partners for Aura include some of the top Solana-based platforms and services such as Magic Eden, Tensor, Solflare, QuickNode, and many more.\n\nBy open-sourcing the platform (see ‚öôÔ∏èTools for link to repo), Metaplex invites developers to contribute to its development and help shape and improve the Solana ecosystem.\n\nMetaplex Aura: A Decentralized Indexing and Data Availability Network for Solana\n\nüëõ Phantom Embedded Wallets\n\nPhantom has introduced a new embedded wallet feature, making user onboarding easier for developers building on Solana.¬†\n\nWith seedless sign-in, users can create self-custodial accounts using just an email and a four-digit PIN, removing the need for complicated seed phrases.¬†\n\nThis reduces friction for new users, allowing them to access crypto without app downloads or browser extensions.\n\nThe embedded wallet features a full UI within the app, enabling users to swap tokens, view balances, and monitor transactions, all while developers focus on building their core products.¬†\n\nAdditionally, the universal Phantom account ensures seamless access across mobile, embedded, and browser extension versions.\n\nFor developers, this simplifies wallet integration, streamlining onboarding and enhancing the user experience.¬†\n\nPhantom's launch partners include Jupiter Exchange, Raydium, Orca, Drift Protocol, Kamino Finance, and Lulo.\n\nDevelopers can apply for early access.\n\nPhantom Wallet Launches Embedded Wallets for Easy Sign-Up\n\nüöÖ Bullet L2\n\nBullet is a new Solana Layer 2 scaling solution being developed on Solana by Zeta Markets, known for its work in creating on-chain derivatives, and Sovereign Labs, a leader in building secure zk-rollups¬†\n\nIt aims to drastically improve the performance of dApps on Solana by using an architecture that combines Solana‚Äôs powerful L1 for settlement and data availability with a zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) that operates off-chain.¬†\n\nThis combination allows Bullet to offer fast transactions and scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security.\n\nThe Solana community has long prided itself on being able to scale without the need for an L2.¬†\n\nUnlike Ethereum, which relies heavily on L2s to handle congestion, Solana has aimed to be a ‚Äúsingle giant world computer‚Äù capable of processing transactions rapidly on its L1.¬†\n\nThis has made L2 solutions somewhat controversial within the Solana community.¬†\n\nHowever, the developers behind Bullet have leveraged Solana‚Äôs existing strengths while introducing additional layers to improve performance in specific, high-demand use cases.\n\nFor Solana developers, Bullet offers several benefits:\n\nSpeed and Scalability: Bullet will allow developers to build dApps that can operate at much higher speeds and larger scales than was previously possible, with a user experience that rivals centralized platforms.\nCustomizability: By using a modular approach that separates execution and settlement, Bullet gives developers more flexibility in how they design their applications, enabling innovations that are not possible on L1 alone.\nSeamless Integration: Since Bullet uses Solana L1 for settlement and data availability, developers can easily integrate their applications with the rest of the Solana ecosystem while benefiting from the enhanced performance of an L2.\n\nBullet‚Äôs testnet is scheduled for Q4 2024, with a full mainnet launch expected in early 2025.\n\nBullet: Real-time L2 on Solana\n\nüëº Frankendancer... It's aliiiiiiiive!\n\nJump CSO Kevin Bowers announced during Breakpoint that the Frankendancer client is now live on mainnet, while the much-anticipated Firedancer upgrade has launched on the testnet.\n\nFrankendancer, a precursor to Firedancer, previously achieved an impressive milestone of one million transactions per second (TPS) on a globally distributed 100-node cluster.\n\nFiredancer, currently live on the testnet, is a new validator client with a completely new codebase developed by Jump. It aims to significantly improve network throughput, resilience, and efficiency.\n\nJump Crypto‚Äôs Frankendancer client launches on Solana mainnet and Firedancer on testnet\n\nüë©‚Äçüéì Turbin3 Educational Programs\n\nTurbin3 is gearing up for Q4 2024, offering a series of high-level programs aimed at Solana developers and researchers.¬†\n\nTurbin3's flagship Builders program will launch its 8th Cohort in mid-October, targeting driven individuals who aspire to build and ship innovative projects.¬†\n\nFor more advanced developers, the Advanced SVM program will explore deeper Solana topics like Runtime and the SVM API.¬†\n\nAdditionally, an Advanced Programming on Solana course will focus on Rust and C for performance optimization.¬†\n\nFinally, Turbin3 will soon announce a new research initiative, aiming to establish Solana as a leader in Web3 research.¬†\n\nI graduated both Turbin3's (then WBA) builders cohort and Artisans program. If you like in-depth, hands-on learning I would highly recommend signing up!\n\nTurbin3\n\nüåä QuickNode Solana Streams\n\nSolana Streams is a new push-based solution from QuickNode that delivers real-time blockchain data, eliminating the need for constant polling or complex processing.\n\nThis is vital for DeFi apps, NFTs, and trading platforms that require instant updates to function effectively.\n\nKey Benefits for Developers:\n\nReal-Time Data Delivery: Immediate updates on blockchain events like token transfers and account changes, perfect for applications needing fast reactions.\n\nEfficiency at Scale: Subscribe to specific events, simplifying the data pipeline and reducing overhead.\n\nSeamless Integration: Designed to handle millions of accounts with low latency, making it ideal for large-scale applications.\n\nThe Ultimate Solana Developer Platform Now Supercharged with Solana Streams\n\n‚ö° Quick Hits\n\nHow to Send Transactions with Solana Web3.js 2.0 - @QuickNode\n\nToken-2022 Security Best Practices - Part 1: Mint & Token Account - Offside Labs\n\nThe top AI projects on Solana today - @0xGumshoe\n\nSolana‚Äôs Hackathons: From 0 to hero (Part I) - Ari\n\nTensor is now fully open-sourced - @0xrwu\n\nJupiter Acquires SolanaFM and Unveils Major Updates: Everything You Need to Know - SolanaFloor\n\nSquads Protocol v5: The Next Evolution Of SVM Smart Accounts - Squads\n\nDeanslist announces two exclusive metaplex ecosystem grant programs - @deanslistDAO\n\nThe SolanaFM Story: From launch to acquisition - @nixxholas\n\n‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Resources\n\nAura is a decentralized indexing and data availability network that extends Solana and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).\n\nwallet-adapter-svelte-ui is a direct port of Anza's wallet adapter to Svelte 5 with improved UI, accessibility, and performance.

    "content": "ü¶û Solana Boston\n\nSolana Boston, the first-ever Solana city conference in the US, will take place on October 19, 2024, at the MIT Media Lab.\n\nHosted by Boston DAO and supported by the Solana Foundation, the event is a place for US-based developers to connect, learn, and grow together.\n\nHappening just a month after Breakpoint, Solana Boston hopes to extend the momentum stateside.\n\nSpeaker applications are open now.\n\nSolana Boston\n\nüìÖ Breakpoint Agenda\n\nThe Breakpoint agenda has been announced with sessions across three key themes:\n\nLeft Curve:\nThis track focuses on culture and products, with a fireside chat between Raj Gokal and Balaji Srinivasan discussing the Solana Network State.¬†\n\nHighlights include updates on Firedancer, a debate on Crypto East vs. West, and product keynotes from ecosystem founders like FP Lee of Sanctum and Siong of Jupiter.\n\nRight Curve:\nA deep dive into tech, featuring sessions on sandwich-resistant AMMs, hands-on Solana Actions, blinks, and ZK compression. A major highlight will be Toly and Mert discussing Solana 2.0.\n\nEcosystem Activation:\nConnect with the community at \"The Pod,\" attend workshops, and level up Radar hackathon projects at the Colosseum Arena.\n\nüó≥Ô∏è Blockworks MetaDAO Report\n\nThis report from Blockworks explores how MetaDAO leverages futarchy to improve governance, its early results, and the potential this governance model holds for DAOs seeking to align decision-making with financial incentives.\n\nThe futarchy protocol proposed by MetaDAO addresses a flaw in DAO governance: misaligned incentives and inefficient decision-making.¬†\n\nBy leveraging conditional markets, futarchy turns speculation into a tool that lets market participants \"bet\" on the outcome of proposals based on if they believe a decision will positively affect a token's market value.¬†\n\nTraders evaluate the impact of a decision based on data rather than pure opinion or ideology. The outcome could lead to more value-driven decisions for DAOs.¬†\n\nMetaDAO is pioneering this approach by directly applying it to its own governance, making it both a platform and a case study for futarchy-based decision-making.\n\nHowever, this model is still in an experimental phase.¬†\n\nWith just ~$675k in market volume and 15 proposals, the liquidity and participation levels remain modest. Without sufficient trading volume and participation, the markets may not produce reliable signals, which is key to the success of futarchy.¬†\n\nIf successful, futarchy could not only improve DAO governance, but also attract wider adoption across Solana, particularly among organizations seeking more efficient decision-making processes.\n\nMetaDAO: Market Incentives for Improved Decision-Making\n\nüè¶ The Finternet on Solana\n\nThe Finternet is an initiative to create a global network of tokenized assets such as stablecoins, stocks, and NFTs where users can transact with anyone worldwide.\n\nTo support this goal, Solana Foundation has announced a $1M grant program for developers, founders, and policy professionals contributing to building the Finternet on Solana.¬†\n\nGrants range from $1,000 to $10,000 and focus on areas like user applications, token management tools, authentication wallets, and the Unified Ledger infrastructure.¬†\n\nSolana Foundation Finternet Instagrants\n\nüí∞ Solana Foundation RFPs\n\nThe Solana Foundation has announced two new RFPs aimed at driving the development of open source data tooling for the Solana blockchain, with up to $160,000 in available funding.\n\nThe Solana Indexer Tooling RFP offers $100,000 in funding to develop an open-source infrastructure solution for accessing real-time and historical data from Solana programs and accounts.¬†\n\nDeliverables include a tool for indexing real-time and historical updates for a set of accounts and programs using Anchor IDLs with features like account tracking, program listeners, transaction indexes, and integration with the Luzid local validator.\n\nThe Solana Discriminator Directory RFP provides $60,000 in funding to create an open-source discriminator database, which aims to enable developers to interact with unknown deployed programs and parse their instructions.¬†\n\nThe goal is to build a comprehensive solution that simplifies how developers access and manage program discriminators on Solana, making it easier for them to work with programs whose details may not be fully known or accessible.\n\nThe proposed solution includes the development of an API that allows developers to fetch program discriminators and access a community-managed dataset. This dataset will allow users to upload discriminators making it available to others in a structured format.\n\nBoth RFPs are open for submissions until October 4, 2024.\n\nSolana Foundation RFPs\n\n‚ö° Quick Hits\n\nSolana Gets Physical With DePIN - Bankless\n\nBlurt Developer Thinks Crypto Makes for Better Donations to Twitch Streamers - CoinDesk\n\nIronForge adds improvements including a new Firewall product and System Status page - IronForge\n\nGodot Solana SDK: Smart Contract Video Series - Zen Republic\n\nThe State of DePIN: The Growth and Evolution of Crypto's Next Big Use Case - MV Global\n\nHow to fetch parsed Solana transactions faster and in bulk - Shyft\n\nCallisto now supports Solana Blinks inside Discord - @callisto_wallet\n\nüí∏ Funding\n\nDRiP has raised $8 million in a seed funding round led by NFX, Coinbase Ventures, and Progression Fund.

Developers can run programs within the zkVM that execute extensive calculations, which would be costly or inefficient if done directly on-chain.\n\nOnce the off-chain computation is complete, zkVM generates a proof that can be efficiently verified on-chain using Solana Programs using the RISC Zero verifier without requiring the Solana network to re-execute the computation.\n\nzkVM allows developers to integrate it into their existing Solana-based dApps without requiring significant changes to the dApp‚Äôs architecture.\n\nDevelopers can use zkVM to build:\n\nSolana Light Clients that verify transactions and state changes with minimal data, reducing the need for full node participation and enhancing decentralization.\nCompressed DePIN Networks with reduced data storage and processing requirements, improving efficiency and scalability.\nSecure ZK-Logins for secure, zero-knowledge-based authentication mechanisms within Solana dApps, reducing centralization risks while maintaining privacy.\n\nThe integration of zkVM with Solana provides advanced zero-knowledge features while also maintaining the performance and scalability that Solana is known for, unlocking new possibilities for dApp development, better scalability, and enhanced privacy and security.\n\nIntroducing ZK on Solana, powered by RISC Zero\n\nüëÄ New Capabilities for Blinks\n\nDialect announced new capabilities for blinks that dramatically expand what you can build.\n\nThese new features include:\n\nAction Chaining: Now you can create a sequence of actions within a single blink. For example, e-commerce platforms can chain actions like filling in shipping information, making a purchase, and providing a follow-up email address, all in one seamless flow.\nAdvanced Input Types: Blinks now support customizable fields, select menus, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more advanced input types like numbers, phone numbers, and emails, making interactions richer and more versatile.\nMultichain & Blink Version Compatibility: Blinks are now compatible across multiple chains and different versions, ensuring a seamless experience no matter the platform.\nSign Message (Coming Soon): This feature will enable interactions with offchain services and crypto-native applications, opening up new possibilities like storing shipping information or tipping creators on platforms like Drip.\n\nThese features are now live on dial.to and will roll out to the five supporting wallets in the coming days.\n\nWith these new tools, developers can embed powerful, flexible experiences anywhere a link is shared.\n\nBlinks Action Chaining\n\n‚ö° Quick Hits\n\nSolana Virtual Machine: Powering the Future of Web3 Gaming - The Market Periodical\n\nMastering Anchor Vaults: A Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Secure Solana Vault Program - Ritik Bhatt\n\nSome of Solana's Most Interesting Experiments - Bankless\n\nFuzzing Solana Smart Contracts with Trident - 0xJesus\n\nSocial for Startups: How to build a social presence from scratch - a16z Crypto\n\nReviewing Token Extensions on Solana Using Formal Verification - Certora\n\nAgave v2.0 Transition Guide - Anza\n\nLI.FI Expands to Solana - LI.FI\n\nPresenting Blinkathon: The Community-powered Solana Blinks Hackathon - @thesendcoin\n\nWorking with Radar and Valid8 [video] - @jacobvcreech\n\nReport: Solana The Modular - @Delphi_Digital\n\n‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Resources\n\nEvent Ticketing is a Core AppData Plugin example for building a ticketing solution that could be used to generate tickets as digital assets and verified by an external source of trust other than the issuer.\n\nSquads Backup Kit is a suite of Open-source UI, CLI, and SDK tools providing multiple options for Squads users to access their assets. This means that even in the unlikely case where the Squads UI is unavailable, users still have a permissionless method to access their assets.\n\nMagicBlock Ephemeral Validator is a containerized version of the Ephemeral SVM Validator with the full SVM, RPC, WebSocket, and Geyser RPC in less than 50 MB. There are plans to make this open source in the future.\n\nchadbuffer is a heavily optimized Solana program that allows you to manage and manipulate permissioned data buffers on the Solana blockchain with parallel broadcast, optimal instruction size, self-healing state, and priority fee support.\n\nsolana-smart-contract-security-best-practices is a helpful repo for security best practices in Solana programs.\n\ncoal-cli is the CLI for COAL cryptocurrency mining.\n\nüíÄ RIP\n\nShutting Down: Armada CLMM\n\nThe Armada team has decided to shut down all self-serve products, including their successful Concentrated Liquidity Market Making (CLMM) product, due to regulatory risks for US-based contributors and challenges in marketing the product under current US regulations.\n\nAdditionally, they found that many users of similar products were primarily focused on airdrop farming rather than the product's core value, leading the team to conclude that launching a token to incentivize usage was not aligned with their vision.\n\nüë©‚Äçüîß Get Hired\nSolana Mobile is hiring a Senior Backend Software Engineer\nBridgesplit is hiring a Frontend Engineer\nWynd Labs (Grass) is hiring a DevOps Engineer\nCega is looking for a Smart Contract Engineer - Solana\nIdeaSoft needs a Rust Developer (Solana experience)\nüìÖ Event Calendar\nSolana Build Station, Belgrade, Sept 2\nComets of Web3 and Solana Community Event, Bucharest, Sept 4\nSolana Nomads, Almaty, Kazakhstan, Oct 17-20\nüéß Listen to This\nSolfate\n\nA conversation with Matty, co-founder of Colosseum, the premier Solana ecosystem accelerator and hackathons.\n\nColosseum recently wrapped up its first accelerator program, which followed its online hackathon. The accelerator program is a six-week online program that helps teams push towards a mainnet release and provides support in technical and non-technical areas.\n\nColosseum also recently closed a $60 million venture fund and invests $250,000 in each startup that goes through its accelerator program. The teams in the accelerator program have received feedback on various aspects, including legal and entity structure, team composition, and early customer communication. Colosseum aims to evaluate teams based on their ability to ship quickly and efficiently.\n\nColosseum is focused on supporting the Solana ecosystem by providing funding, mentorship, and resources to early-stage projects.\n\nThey run hackathons to identify talented teams and provide them with pre-seed funding and support. The accelerator program helps teams refine their ideas and secure additional funding.\n\nColosseum also plays a role in educating and convincing later-stage funds to invest in the Solana ecosystem. They are working on building a co-founder matching platform to help teams find the right partners.\n\nThe Radar Hackathon is scheduled for September 2nd to October 8th.\n\nColosseum's Venture Fund: Investing in Solana Startups and Building a Co-Founder Matching Platform\n\nBonus Episodes\n\nCommunity and Culture with Solana OG Based Charker - Midcurve\n\nIn this episode, Midcurve sits down with Chase to dive into the early days of Solana, surfing, and the importance of community in the crypto space, exploring what it truly takes to make Solana great, with Chase sharing his unique perspective on the journey and the passion that drives the ecosystem forward.\n\nSolana's outperformance and the emergence of secular winners with Ryan Watkins - Logan Jastremski\n\nRyan Watkins is the Co-Founder of Syncracy Capital: A thesis-driven hedge fund making high conviction, concentrated investments in the secular winners of the crypto economy.\n\nGamifying fitness: Moonwalk wants to turn user tasks into tokenized rewards - The Scoop\n\nIn this episode, Caitlin Cook, Director of growth at Moonwalk Fitness, shares how Moonwalk is attempting to build a consumer crypto app that helps people hit their health goals through daily step competitions.

    "content": "ü§ê Solana Quietly Patches Vulnerability\n\nLast week Solana validators quietly implemented a critical security patch, preventing what could have been a major network outage.\n\nThe patch was rolled out following a private alert sent to major validators through various channels like Discord. This confidential approach was required to ensure the vulnerability was addressed before it could be exploited.\n\nThe decision to implement the patch quietly sparked debate about the network's decentralization.\n\nSome community members questioned how such a significant portion of validators, more than 70% of the network's stake, could coordinate so swiftly without public disclosure.\n\nCritics argued this suggests centralization, but defenders of the process countered that handling critical vulnerabilities in public would have exposed the network to exploits.\n\nThe confidentiality was necessary to protect the network's integrity.\n\nDespite concerns, the fast response from the Solana Foundation and its validator community avoided downtime, and reflects a community that is capable of quickly responding to threats.\n\nSolana prevents potential outage, patches critical vulnerability\n\nüîí Squads Policy Network\n\nThe Squads Policy Network (SPN) is a decentralized network designed to enhance the functionality of the Squads Protocol. It enables the implementation of granular and general-purpose transaction policies for onchain smart accounts.\n\nThe SPN functions as a conditional signer for smart accounts, approving or rejecting transactions based on user-defined policies. These policies allow for fine-grained control over transactions, but in a trustless and decentralized manner.\n\nThe key features of SPN are:\n\nGranular Transaction Policies: The SPN allows for precise controls over transactions, including parameterization by subaccount, transaction type, program interaction, and asset type.\nSecurity: The network simulates and authenticates transactions to protect against malicious programs, counterparties, and potential exploits.\nCompliance: The SPN enforces compliance with local jurisdictional and regulatory standards, KYC verification, and sanctions checks.\nAutomation Guardrails: The SPN provides guardrails for automated workflows, which is critical as AI-driven automation becomes more prevalent.\n\nThe SPN gives Solana developers the tools to create secure, compliant, and flexible onchain applications, and accelerating the adoption of dApps.\n\nIntroducing the Squads Policy Network (SPN)\n\nüö¢ The Port Miami Ship Week\n\nThe Port announced Miami Ship Week, which runs from September 2nd through September 7th in Wynwood.

    "content": "Since this is a Solana developer newsletter, It's safe to assume you're a developer, so I have a favor to ask:\n\nCan you all slow down... just a bit?\n\nI'm trying to pack in all the good stuff each week, but there's just too much good stuff!\n\nI even channeled my inner Lady Whistledown (for any Bridgerton fans reading this) to make this humble request.\n\nNow I know you won't slow down anytime soon (I really don't want you to) and I'll do my best to keep up.\n\nIt's exciting to see so many big things happening in the Solana space that are OPOS and I can't wait to see what you build next!\n\nThere was some BIG news this week with Colosseum Fund I, Actions & Blinks, VanEck's filing for a SOL ETF, and ZK Compression, along with a slew of new testing tools, making it a week of wins for Solana developers, so here's all the latest news...\n\nüí∞ Colosseum Fund I\n\nColosseum has secured $60 million for its first fund, named Colosseum Fund I with a focus on pre-seed investments in winners of Solana Hackathons.\n\nThe funds will be used to grow Colosseum's programs and accelerate the development of early-stage projects on Solana.\n\nIt's evident that there is a market demand for novel, specialized venture products in crypto, and we are excited to have a diverse group of investors, including ecosystem founders and hackathon alumni, alongside us to realize our vision for Colosseum\n~ Clay Robbins, Co-founder Colosseum\n\nColosseum has already deployed $2.75 million across 11 companies including Ore (a mineable token project), Urani (a Solana intent-based swap aggregator), and BlockMesh (a Solana-based DePIN project) and other winning projects from the Renaissance Hackathon.\n\nThe timeline for the full deployment of the fund is expected to occur over three to four years, depending on the size of future cohorts and the need for follow-on investments.\n\nAnnouncing Colosseum Fund I\n\n‚õìÔ∏è Solana Actions & Blockchain Blinks\n\nBlockchain Links & Actions, or just Blinks, are a new primitive introduced by the Solana Foundation and Dialect that transform onchain actions into links you can share anywhere on the internet.\n\nBlinks enable blockchain transactions to be initiated from any website, social media platform, or QR code, removing the need for users to leave their current environment or requiring a dedicated dApp.\n\nBlinks borrow concepts from Farcaster Frames, while Actions incorporate the models of Solana Pay transaction requests and Dialect smart messages. Together, they give Solana developers a powerful new tool to create new experiences and onboard more users to Solana.\n\nActions are APIs that enable onchain transactions. These transactions can be initiated via various means such as buttons on websites, widgets, or QR codes. Essentially, an Action is an API endpoint that returns a Solana transaction to be viewed and signed by the user, and executed on-chain.\n\nBlinks extend the functionality of Actions by turning them into shareable, metadata-rich links. Blinks enable clients, such as wallet extensions and bots, to present additional UI options for interacting with Solana Actions directly.\n\nBlinks can be linked to an Action in three ways:\n\nExplicit Action URL: Sharing a specific Action URL, e.g., solana-action:https://actions.alice.com/donate, which supported clients like Dialect can render.\nWebsite Link: Sharing a link to a website linked to an Action API through an actions.json file at the root of the website.\nEmbedded Action URL: Embedding the Action URL into a URL of a Blink provider like https://blink.to/?action=<action_url>.\n\nThese links enable wallet extensions to present additional UI options for interacting with Solana Actions directly.\n\nBlinks can be used for NFT Transactions, Donations and Crowdfunding, DAO Voting, Raffles & Sweepstakes, and open the door to many other types of use cases.\n\nTo get you started check out these articles, dive into the Solana Actions repo (in Tools below), and play around with Znap (also in Tools), an early Rust-based framework shared by Heavy Duty Builders for developing Solana Action APIs.\n\nBlockchain Links and Solana Actions (Solana)\n\nIntroducing Blinks & the Actions Stack (Dialect)\n\nA Complete Preliminary Introduction to Solana Actions & Blinks (@adlonymous)\n\nüóúÔ∏è ZK Compression\n\nZK Compression is a new primitive introduced by Light Protocol and Helius Labs, designed to enhance Solana's scalability and performance.\n\nBy leveraging zero-knowledge proofs and state roots, this technology will also address the state growth problem on Solana, while maintaining the security, performance, and composability Solana developers rely on.\n\nZK Compression works by storing only state roots (fingerprints of all compressed accounts) on-chain, while the detailed data is kept off-chain. It uses small validity proofs to ensure the accuracy of the compressed state without revealing the full data, and utilizes calldata to minimize on-chain storage requirements.\n\nIt drastically lowers the cost of on-chain operations, making tasks like airdrops significantly cheaper. Additionally, it is fully composable and two-way compatible with existing SPL tokens, allowing seamless integration with existing Solana applications.\n\nThis offers a 10,000x improvement in scaling capabilities, enabling developers to build and scale applications more efficiently.\n\nHowever, the introduction of ZK Compression has sparked debate, particularly around its naming. Critics argue that the ZK term might mislead users into thinking it functions like a traditional rollup.\n\nSome in the Ethereum community have labeled ZK Compression as a Layer 2 (L2) solution, but this is just wrong.\n\nZK Compression is not an L2 because transactions and state transitions occur directly on Solana, not on an auxiliary chain. The compressed state is stored on Solana as calldata, unlike traditional L2 solutions that store state off-chain and then update the main chain.\n\nZK Compression operates entirely on Solana, without the need for a separate execution layer or external sequencers. It preserves the benefits of L2 scaling without the associated complexities and limitations.\n\nZK Compression represents a significant advancement in Solana‚Äôs scalability, providing developers with powerful tools to reduce costs and enhance performance, all while maintaining the integrity and simplicity of Solana‚Äôs L1.\n\nWhat is ZK Compression?\n\nüìà VanEck Solana ETF\n\nVanEck has filed for the first Solana ETF in the United States.\n\nThe ETF, named the VanEck Solana Trust, is designed to reflect the performance of SOL's price by directly backing the Trust‚Äôs shares with SOL.\n\nSOL‚Äôs decentralized nature, high utility, and economic feasibility align with the characteristics of other established digital commodities, reinforcing our belief that SOL may be a valuable commodity with use cases for investors, builders, and entrepreneurs looking for alternatives to the duopoly app stores\n~ Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research\n\nVanEck argues that SOL functions similarly to digital commodities like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and that it should be classified as a commodity despite the SEC previously labeling it as a security.\n\nThe ETF will not engage in staking or earning additional SOL.\n\nInstead, it will value its shares daily using the MarketVector Solana Benchmark Rate, which is based on prices from a carefully selected group of trading platforms.\n\nThis move follows VanEck's previous successes with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and aims to meet the increasing demand for secure and regulated digital asset investment products.\n\nBitcoin ETF issuer VanEck files for Solana ETF in the US\n\nüèÖ Solana Summit APAC Hackathon Winners\n\nA part of the recent Solana Summit APAC was a hackathon and the winners have been announced:\n\n@DeStreetdApp is a non-custodial dApp that enables copy trading with your friends and community.\n@requestdapp is a platform for onchain events, tickets, & marketplace.\n@AidEyeKit is a toolkit enabling app makers to create visual guides within apps.\n@crediblefin is a liquidity layer for tokenization, unlocking credit for tokenized assets, private credit and trade finance.\n@itheum is building the data layer for the AI era by tokenizing your data using NFTs.\n\nCongrats to all the winners!\n\nüíé Developer News\n\nSpeedrun Honeycomb Track\nHoneycomb Protocol, which offers a suite of tools for Web3 game developers, has added a track to Solana Speedrun Game Jam 3 with a $600 USDC prize for the best games that use the Honeycomb Protocol.\n\nDePIN x Meme Coin Summit NYC\nThis summit, hosted in New York on July 16, explores the intersections between meme coins and DePIN projects, which often struggle to attract attention and capital. The goal is to guide founders towards a product-centric roadmap through focused execution and collaboration.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Resources\n\nsolana-actions are specification-compliant APIs that return transactions on the Solana blockchain to be previewed, signed, and sent across a number of various contexts, including QR codes, buttons + widgets, and websites across the internet.\n\nawesome-blinks is a community curated list of awesome Solana Actions and Blinks.\n\nznap is a Rust-based framework designed to simplify the creation of APIs that are compatible with the Solana Actions specification with Rust eDSL for writing Solana actions, macro collection, and a CLI for developing complete Solana actions\n\nmollusk is a fast SVM program test harness designed to directly invoke the loaded executable program using the BPF Loader, bypassing any transaction sanitization and runtime checks, and instead directly processing the instruction with the BPF Loader.\n\nlitesvm is a fast and lightweight library for testing Solana programs.

Today, we're excited to share that we've raised $60 million from an incredible group of investors to continue supporting founders building on Solana at the earliest stages.\n\nWhile the entry point is simple (just a few clicks), the global competition in Colosseum hackathons results in a hardened, diverse, and meritocratic set of winners. These talented teams not only take the first step in developing a project they believe will have a significant impact, but are also willing to test their ideas against other elite builders from across the world. The drive and technical ability to will their ideas into existence are rare and valuable traits that we believe will define the next era of products generating enduring demand for block space.\n\nWe built Colosseum‚Äôs online platform and accelerator program to efficiently onramp developers into the crypto startup and venture ecosystems. This supporting infrastructure, along with a vast group of mentors and hackathon alumni, serves to streamline the initial stages of building a new network, market, application, or any other zero to one innovation.\n\nThe last 15 years of crypto has taught us that the best ideas often arise from the most uncommon corners of the internet. Colosseum‚Äôs mission is to ensure more of those ideas are brought into production and accelerate the growth of the onchain economy.",

    "content": "Rough week, huh?¬†\n\nLet's just focus on the positives. Sounds good to you?¬†\n\nLast week's Solana v1.18.15 upgrade has made noticeable improvements to performance with faster confirmation times and ~2k true TPS.\n\nEven more important, the upgrade (>95% of validators are now running v1.18) went off without any major issues.\n\nDevs that don't do anything to their apps will still see overall improvements in performance, but there are some optimizations you can make to really take advantage of this update.\n\nSetting proper priority fees and using SWQoS nodes will give apps a boost, but minimizing and optimizing the Compute Units (CUs) used by your app is the most direct thing devs can do.\n\nIn Solana, CUs are the measure of resources used by a transaction or a program (like gas in Ethereum) and ensures that no single transaction can monopolize network resources.\n\nTransaction fees in Solana are determined by the number of CUs it consumes. More complex transactions will use more CUs and therefore incur higher fees.\n\nWhen you create a transaction you specify the maximum number of CUs that the transaction is allowed to consume. If your transaction goes over this budget, it fails.\n\nDevelopers are encouraged to write the most efficient code to minimize the number of CUs their programs use.\n\nBut how do you actually do that?\n\nThere are some quick wins like using the smallest data types possible, avoiding unnecessary logging, and saving PDA bumps in an account.\n\nDepending on your program code, there are plenty of other things to consider when trying to optimize the CUs your program uses.\n\nRather than trying to include them all here, take a look at these resources to learn more about minimizing the CUs used by your programs:\n\nHow to Optimize Compute Usage on Solana\nOptimizing CU in programs\nIntroduction to Solana Compute Units and Transaction Fees\nSolana Fees in Theory and Practice\n\nTransaction fees are already so cheap that shaving off a few fractions of a cent in fees might not sound important, but we can make transactions more efficient, decrease demand on network resources, and improve the overall UX of Solana!\n\nHere's a roundup of more good news for Solana builders...\n\nüåû Solana Summer Kickoff IRL\n\nSolana is making it easy for anyone to host their own IRL meetup on Thursday, 27 June and meet the builders in your community\n\nThere are meetups in 120+ cities around the world you can join or host in your city.\n\nEvents only happen if someone from the community steps up to host and sets the location, capacity, and start time.\n\nAnyone can also apply for a Community Grant to start your own community or host a major event like SolanaSummit or Consensus Snapshot.\n\nIf the Chicago event happens, I'll be there!\n\nSolana Summer Kickoff\n\n‚õ∞Ô∏è mtnDAO v6\n\nThe mtndao Summit returns the entire month of August in Salt Lake City, offering developers a unique experience of building and collaboration.\n\nmtndao offers interactive workshops, coding sessions, and collaborative projects with deep dives into Solana, hands-on technical support, thought-provoking discussions, and networking with like-minded developers.\n\nBuilders at all stages of their journey are welcome, from seasoned professionals to budding enthusiasts and the summit is designed to accommodate participants who need to continue working full time.\n\nmtnDAO v6 Registration\n\nüßô Pyth Pull Oracle\n\nThe Pyth Network, known for providing reliable market data, has launched its new Pull Oracle model on Solana.\n\nTraditionally, Pyth used a push oracle system, which sent updated prices to the blockchain at regular intervals. This method faced limitations during the periods of network congestion that Solana has dealt with recently.\n\nThe transition to a pull oracle model brings some key benefits.\n\nDevelopers can now request price updates as needed, providing real-time data essential for DeFi transactions, even during congestion.\n\nAccess to Pyth Benchmarks allows querying of historical prices, aiding in accurate settlement and prevention of frontrunning.\n\nSeveral of the most popular platforms in the Solana ecosystem have already transitioned to the Pyth pull oracle, including Kamino, Jupiter, Zeta Markets, GooseFX, Lifinity, Bonfida, and many more.\n\nDevelopers looking to implement the Pyth pull oracle can start with this guide on How to Use Real-Time Data in Solana Programs\n\nPyth Pull Oracle Launches on Solana\n\n‚≠ï Circle Credits Program\n\nDesigned to subsidize the costs of building on-chain apps, the Circle Credits Program supports developers at various stages who are building apps with Circle's Web3 Services.\n\nThese credits can be used to cover:\n\nMonthly fees for Programmable Wallets\nAPI calls for Smart Contract Platforms\nNetwork and platform fees at the Gas Station\n\nIf you're a developer working with USDC, you can apply to receive up to $1000 in Circle credits.\n\nCircle‚Ä®Credits Program Application\n\nüíé Developer News\n\nMagicBlock Game Engine\nThe first footage of the MagicBlock Engine has been \"leaked\". MagicBlock achieves this performance by using a temporarily delegated account that is readable on Solana, but locked for the duration of the play session. Other transactions are sent directly to Solana and can read the locked account state, which is committed by the validator, verified, and settled on Mainnet.\n\nSolana Incubator Demo Day\nThe Solana Incubator Demo Day is on June 26 where you'll hear from the first cohort including Armada, Espresso Cash, Juicer, Sanctum, Shaga, Zeebit on their progress & impact made during the Incubator program.\n\nGodot Web3 Game Tutorial\nThis 10-part video tutorial will show you how to build a Web3 game using Godot Engine and the Solana SDK.

    "content": "Wallets, wallets everywhere...\n\nNearly every action a user takes requires interaction with a wallet: storing and transferring digital assets, authenticating with dApps, and signing transactions.\n\nOne roadblock for onboarding new users into Web3 is wallet complexity. This experience can be intimidating and wallets need to simplify this to onboard the next billion users.\n\nOn that note, there was some big news from Solana wallet providers this week!\n\nFirst up Squads released Fuse wallet, which uses 2FA methods to keep users secure.\n\nNext is TipLink, who's wallet uses Google login instead of seed phrases or extensions.\n\nAnd not to be outdone, Circle, which had announced Web3 Services integration with Solana a while back, has launched Phase 1 which includes support for Programmable Wallets.\n\nIt was also a big month for Phantom with the Bitski acquisition, and Backpack was updated with a bunch of features and improvements including support for the Metaplex Core NFT standard.\n\nThese improvements to Solana wallets will help onboard new users into Web3 by making it easier for non-technical users to get started and help keep them safe.\n\nCheck out the details below along with a roundup of all the latest news for Solana builders!\n\nüöÄ Solana v1.18 Update\n\nThe Solana 1.18 update marks a significant advancement in Solana's performance, reliability, and efficiency.\n\nThe biggest change in Solana 1.18 is the introduction of an optimized Central Transaction Scheduler. This scheduler replaces the previous model of four independent banking threads, each responsible for its own transaction prioritization and processing.\n\nOther key features and improvements in this update include:\n\nTransaction Prioritization\n\nPreviously, prioritization was based primarily on compute budget priority, which could lead to suboptimal compute unit pricing. The new model takes into account the base fees collected, making resources appropriately priced.\n\nImproved Program Deployments\n\nSignificant improvements have been made to program deployments in terms of reliability and execution efficiency.\n\nEpoch Transition Adjustments addresses an issue where programs deployed in the last slot of an epoch did not correctly apply the runtime environment changes planned for the subsequent epoch.\n\nNow, programs deployed during this transition period will use the upcoming epoch's runtime environment, ensuring consistency and reliability.\n\nHandling Congestion\n\nReferred to as \"The Congestion Patch\" this update addresses Solana's recent congestion issues:\n\nQUIC Protocol Adjustments: QUIC now treats low-staked peers as unstaked peers in Stake-Weighted Quality of Service (SWQoS), preventing spam by nodes with minimal stake.\nImproved Metrics: New metrics have been added for better visibility of packets sent from staked versus non-staked nodes.\nOptimized Packet Handling: Replacing instances of vec with smallvec saves an allocation per packet, optimizing how packet chunks are handled.\n\nThe update also includes improvements to translation support for Solana's official documentation.\n\nThese improvements in Solana 1.18 are expected to significantly enhance the network's overall performance, making it more efficient and reliable for both developers and users.\n\nAll You Need to Know About Solana's v1.18 Update\n\nüíØ Bond Loyalty Platform\n\nBond is a new platform and API by Solana Labs, that enables brands to use blockchain technology to create personalized loyalty programs.\n\nBond enables engagement programs and digital activations where customers can connect and interact with the brand with custom privacy settings for company and customer data.\n\nBond's API is user-friendly and well-documented, making it easy for brands to understand and implement without prior blockchain experience, and can be easily integrated into current systems.\n\nBond: Transform Buyer Relationships Into Lifetime Bonds\n\nüëõ Fuse Wallet\n\nFuse, designed by Squads Labs, leverages smart accounts to offer a secure and programmable experience for users. Fuse is designed to address the limitations of traditional wallets, eliminating the need for seed phrases and centralized exchanges.\n\nFuse uses a dual-layered security mechanism, which includes a Device Key stored locally on your phone and protected by Apple's biometric authentication, and a 2FA Key set to iCloud by default, with an option to upgrade to a Ledger.\n\nRecovery mechanisms in Fuse are also more sophisticated. Users can add up to three Recovery Keys, allowing for wallet recovery without compromising security. Even if you lose your phone or 2FA Key, you can still regain access to your wallet.\n\nIn addition to security, Fuse offers spending limits that enable users to define transaction limits for specific tokens and timeframes.\n\nDevelopers can implement custom logic and rules for onchain interactions, providing greater flexibility for their applications.\n\nAfter months of testing, Fuse is now available on iOS via Apple TestFlight. An Android version is planned for release soon.\n\nFuse: Solana‚Äôs First Smart Wallet\n\nüßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è SolanaFM Explorer 2.0\n\nSolanaFM has release v2.0, which includes significant performance improvements and a host of new features designed to enhance their experience.\n\nPerformance Improvements - SolanaFM has significantly enhanced its search responsiveness.

    "content": "üèÜ Renaissance Hackathon Winners Announced\n\nColosseum has announced the winners of the Solana Renaissance Hackathon!\n\nRenaissance was the 9th Solana Foundation hackathon, bringing together more than 8,300 participants from 95+ countries that submitted 1,071 final projects, making Renaissance the largest online Solana hackathon to date.\n\nGrand Champion\n\nOre, a digital currency that anyone can mine using a novel proof-of-work algorithm on Solana, took home the grand prize of $50,000 USDC, along with passes to attend Breakpoint 2024.\n\nFirst place winners ($30,000 USDC) of the individual tracks were:\n\nConsumer Apps: Banger.lol, a marketplace for trading tweets and supporting creators.\n\nCrypto Infrastructure: High TPS Solana Client, a new client that utilizes efficient scheduling and pipeline optimizations to improve transaction capacity and increase block reward yields.\n\nGaming: Meshmap+City Champ, a new 3D mapping network integrated through a game that generates 3D scans incentivized by token rewards.\n\nDeFi & Payments: Urani, an intent-based swap aggregator bringing protection against toxic MEV at the application layer.\n\nDePIN: Blockmesh, an open network that allows you to monetize your excess bandwidth.\n\nDAOs & Communities: DeTask, an AI-enabled product development platform leveraging DAO labor.\n\nThere were also a few special category winners as well:\n\nUniversity Award (project led by university students): DeVolt\nPublic Goods Award (open-source project that benefits developers): Zircon\nClimate Award (project focused on climate change and sustainability): AquaSave\n\nColosseum co-founder Matty Taylor reminded all participants that won a prize or now, teams should be proud of their participation and keep pushing their projects forward.\n\nYou all should be proud for pushing crypto forward. For those that won, stay focused. This is just the beginning of your startup journey. For those that didn't win, don't be discouraged. Many top eco projects competed in multiple hackathons before finding the right product, with the right cofounders.\n\nCheck out the rest of the winners (2nd to 5th place of each track) and all the honorable mentions:\n\nAnnouncing the Winners of the Solana Renaissance Hackathon\n\nü§ù Gameshift x Google Cloud\n\nSolana Labs announced a partnership with Google Cloud to bring GameShift to customers of Google Cloud.\n\nGameShift provides tools and APIs to offer an accessible platform for developers to add blockchain elements to their games.\n\nWith GameShift, games can now include digital assets, non-custodial wallets for easy sign-ins, scalable creation of in-game assets, NFT marketplaces. and user-generated content that leverage blockchain's benefits such as security, transparency, and interoperability.\n\n\"By bringing GameShift into Google Cloud‚Äôs ecosystem for living games, we're giving developers a streamlined path to build immersive blockchain experiences without wrestling with the underlying technology.\"\n\n~ Jack Buser, Director for Games at Google Cloud\n\nBy making it easier to integrate web3 elements, Solana and Google Cloud are setting the stage for more use of blockchain technologies in the gaming industry.\n\nSolana Labs teams up with Google Cloud on Web3 games via GameShift\n\nüôà Arcium Confidential Computing\n\nArcium is introducing a transformative approach to confidential computing (CC) that enhances privacy and security across blockchain applications.¬†\n\nThis was teased a while back when Elusiv Privacy announced it was sunsetting in favor of a more advanced solution.\n\nTheir new platform leverages advanced cryptographic technologies to provide a trustless and verifiable framework for executing encrypted computations. This enables enhanced security and privacy for applications by encrypting data not just when it is stored or in transit, but also when it is in use.\n\nArcium introduces a shift from hardware dependency towards a cryptographic approach for encryption.¬†\n\nIt utilizes advanced cryptographic techniques including:\n\nMultiparty Computation (MPC): This allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.\n\nHomomorphic Encryption (HE): Enables operations on encrypted data, producing an encrypted result that, when decrypted, matches the result of operations performed on the plaintext.\n\nZero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs): Allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true, without revealing any information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true.\n\nDesigned for developers building in DeFi, AI, and beyond, Arcium uses a parallelized network architecture to provide encrypted computation without relying on hardware solutions or trusted third parties.\n\nArcium's network comprises two main components:\n\nMultiparty Computation Execution Environments (MXEs)\n\nThese are configurable environments where developers can set specific parameters for secure multiparty computations, including who initiates the executions, which nodes participate, and what MPC protocol is used. MXEs support a variety of operations on encrypted data, ensuring that data remains confidential even during computation.\n\nThe Arx Network\n\nThis decentralized network consists of nodes, known as Arx, which collaborate to process encrypted data using MPC. Nodes can form clusters to perform joint computations, ensuring that encrypted data is processed securely without exposing individual data elements.\n\nDevelopers can configure MXEs according to their application needs using Arcium‚Äôs user-friendly API, which includes both a web-based interface and an SDK.¬†\n\nArcium has opened applications for an incentivized private testnet. This opportunity allows developers to run nodes or build applications using Arcium's infrastructure.\n\nArcium: The first parallelized confidential computing network\n\nüì£ Breakpoint 2024 Speakers\n\nThe Solana Foundation has announced the first wave of speakers for Solana Breakpoint 2024.\n\nLast year, Breakpoint attracted over 3,000 participants for a series of keynote speeches, workshops, panel debates, and fireside chats featuring prominent figures from the Solana community.\n\nThis year, the two-day gathering in Singapore from September 20-21¬†will host developers, government bodies, institutions, and creative talents from across the globe to share knowledge and interact with leading authorities.\n\nThe initial speaker lineup for Breakpoint 2024 includes:\n\nHany Rashwan, CEO of 21.co\nBin Chen, co-founder and CTO of Boba Guys\nLuke Truitt, CEO of Bridgesplit\nBen Zhou, CEO of Bybit\nJeremy Allaire, Chairman and CEO of Circle\nMike Cahill, co-founder & CEO of Douro Labs¬†\nCindy Leow, co-founder of Drift\nVibhu Norby, CEO of DRiP\nEmily Meyers, General Counsel at Electric Capital\nLarisa Barbu, co-founder and CEO of Exchange Art\nRan Goldi, SVP Payments & Network at Fireblocks\nStijn Paumen, co-founder and CEO of Helio\nAbhay Kumar, CEO of the Helium Foundation\nCorey Wright, CEO of Honeyland¬†\nMarius Ciubotariu, co-founder of Kamino¬†\nAndrea Fortugno, co-founder and CEO of MagicBlock Labs\nJason Lau, Chief Innovation Officer at OKX\nPaul Bohm, founder of Teleport.xyz\nIlja Moisejevs, CEO of Tensor\nCuy Sheffield, VP, Head of Crypto at Visa\nTristan Frizza, co-founder of Zeta Markets\n\nThe Solana Foundation Unveils First Wave of Speakers for Breakpoint 2024: Visa, Bybit, Circle, Helium, Fireblocks and More\n\nüíé Developer News\n\nSolana Professional Developer Training in NYC\nThe Solana Foundation is hosting a free, 4-day training session (starting May 28) aimed at web developers with TypeScript knowledge that are interested in blockchain technology.

    "content": "üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Solana Crossroads Content Sprint Winners\n\nSolana Crossroads is a community conference hosted in Istanbul, Turkey on May 10-11. Participants of the \"Content Sprint\", which called for creative and viral posts focused on the event, were judged on their content‚Äôs ability to cause FOMO, its originality, creativity, design & overall quality, and the presentation.\n\nHere are the winners (and a link to their content):\n\n1st place ($2500 USDC): @lucylovelyn\n2nd place ($1500 USDC): @fibonacci_sol\n3rd place ($1000 USDC): @gbeni_wealth\nBest Design($1000 USDC): @Prinspire1\nMost Creative ($1000 USDC): @MilanCrypto_258\n\nThere was just a bit of controversy when it was discovered, after the announcement of the winners, that the original 2nd place submission was plagiarized from another creator leading them to be disqualified. The 3rd place winner was then moved up to 2nd place, and a new 3rd place winner was chosen.\n\nSolana Crossroads Content Sprint Winners\n\nüë©‚Äçüîß Congestion Fixes\n\nWhile we can't quite say mission accomplished yet, thanks to the hard work of a lot of people, confirmation times are back under 2 seconds, and the congestion issues we've been dealing with have improved.\n\nWork also continues on v1.18 which will address many of the remaining performance issues and is tentatively scheduled for a May 27th release.\n\nüîó Introducing the SVM Interface\n\nAnza is proposing to define the official SVM specification as an interface.\n\nThis strategy has two main benefits:\n\nDecouple the SVM specification from the specific Agave implementation, allowing for a clear, minimal set of necessary features\nPosition SVM-specific integration testing on the interface, enabling reusable compliance tests for custom SVM implementations.\n\nBy separating the interface (specification) from the implementation, there's a clear distinction between the generic SVM specification and Agave‚Äôs specific SVM implementation, which supports the development of flexible and compatible SVM tooling, such as rollups.\n\nThe changes include introducing the SVM interface as a standalone Rust crate that is intentionally simple and comprised of traits. Other SVM projects can simply implement this interface and know they're spec-compliant.\n\nThis crate will then be implemented in Agave's existing SVM crate. The interface is designed to be specification-compliant and offers a foundation for Rust projects to build SVMs without starting from scratch.\n\nBy creating a clear distinction between the interface (specification) and implementation (Agave‚Äôs SVM), and providing composable tooling, the project aims to standardize how Solana SVMs are built and enhance the ecosystem's flexibility and client diversity.\n\nIntroduce the SVM Interface\n\nüì± Jupiter acquires Ultimate Wallet\n\nJupiter, the leading Solana DEX, has acquired Ultimate Wallet, a developer of DeFi mobile applications, and their mobile team. This is part of Jupiter's Meta Accelerator Strategy and push into mobile offerings.\n\nThe Ultimate app will be sunsetted on May 22nd, 2024. After that you will only be able to retrieve your Ultimate Wallet recovery phrase to import into a new wallet.\n\nJupiter Acquires Ultimate!\n\nüíé Developer News\n\nSolana Project Template Benchmarking\nBenchmarking is vital for program optimization, especially with technologies like Solana where efficiency and speed are so important.

    "content": "üèÅ Renaissance Hackathon Concludes\n\nThe Solana Renaissance Hackathon has come to an end with more than 8,000 builders participating and more than 1,000 projects submitted, making it the largest hackathon in Solana‚Äôs history!\n\nColosseum‚Äôs judging process has started and winners will be announced the week of May 6th.\n\nü•Ç Cheers to all the teams that submitted a project!\n\nMany of the biggest projects in Solana came out of previous hackathons so I can't wait to see what everyone has built.\n\nüò© Congestion Issues & Fixes\n\nIf you've been trying to do anything on Solana lately, you've noticed we've been hitting some serious congestion issues causing a big impact on transactions.\n\nThis situation has stirred up a lot of discussion and debate about what is happening and how to fix it among users and developers.\n\nThe congestion on Solana is primarily attributed to an overwhelming number of transactions. The biggest culprits being spam transactions, notably from bots, and a surge in memecoin trading activities.\n\nThis level of activity has led to a network overload, where the existing infrastructure, particularly the QUIC networking stack, struggles to handle the amount of incoming transactions.\n\nThere's a common misconception that failed transactions indicate a scalability issue or that increasing priority fees could serve as a workaround.\n\nHowever, the real problem lies in the networking layer and the specific implementation of QUIC within Solana's infrastructure, making higher fees ineffective in this case.\n\nFailed transactions are occurring before reaching the consensus layer, making fee adjustments meaningless.\n\nShout out to @0xBreadguy for creating this image to explain the problem!\n\nSolana developers and contributing teams are actively working to resolve these issues.\n\nNetworking Patches and Updates\n\nEfforts are focused on improving the QUIC implementation and enhancing the efficiency of how transactions are processed at the network level. These include addressing the bottlenecks in packet processing and the complexities of the QUIC protocol that make filtering and prioritization challenging.\n\nSoftware Updates\n\nThe upcoming 1.18 update aims to make transaction scheduling more deterministic, reducing bottlenecks and improving overall network performance.\n\nDynamic Priority Fees\n\nThere is also a push towards integrating dynamic priority fees in dApps to improve transaction prioritization, addressing one of the underlying issues contributing to the congestion.\n\nThe community's collaborative efforts are key to finding a fix, highlighting the need for both immediate and long-term strategies to enhance network resilience and scalability.\n\nSolana developers rally to combat network congestion\n\nüß∞ Circle Web3 Services on Solana\n\nCircle's Web3 Services is a suite of tools designed to enhance the accessibility and utility of USDC for developers.\n\nThese services include:\n\nAPIs for Secure Wallet Integration: These APIs allow developers to easily integrate USDC wallets into their applications. By simplifying wallet integration, developers can provide a seamless experience for users to work with USDC.\n\nOn-Chain Transaction Management: Circle provides tools for efficient management of on-chain transactions, including functions for sending, receiving, and monitoring USDC transactions on the blockchain.\n\nProgram Management: For DeFI platforms requiring complex operations, Circle offers solutions for deploying and managing programs that automate various financial transactions without the need for intermediaries.\n\nStreamlined User Onboarding and Transaction Flows: To enhance UX, Circle's services include features for smooth onboarding of new users and streamlined transaction processes. This includes KYC integration, user verification processes, and simplified transaction flows, making it easier to onboard users to your application.\n\nApplications for early access are open to developers now.\n\nCircle Expands Solana Presence with Launch of Web3 Services\n\nüìã Solana Changelog - April 9\n\nIn this week's changelog Bri, a new developer advocate at Solana Foundation, dives into the recent updates on Solana.\n\nSIMD 133 proposes a new \"Get Epoch Stake\" syscall to allow looking up stake delegations during an epoch for convenient access to vote counts and delegated stake.\n\nAn improvement to scan indexes was made to help with some performance issues validators were running into. The total account state was exceeding the available RAM so a new storage format with better indexing was introduced.\n\nIt was discovered that there is an issue with web3.js pre-flight commitment handling that was addressed this week in version 1.91.4.\n\nA new CLI tool called Flare (linked in ‚öôÔ∏è below) that allows interacting with Solana smart contracts directly from the command line.\n\nCheck out the full update:\n\nüíé Developer News\n\nLighthouse Documentation\nLighthouse is a \"runtime assertion\" program that fails transactions when onchain state is not the expected state, intended to prevent exploits and wallet drainers.

    "content": "üó≥Ô∏è Colosseum‚Äôs Proposal to Invest in MetaDAO Passes\n\nColosseum is investing in MetaDAO, a project that has quickly become a focal point for top Solana developers, including winners from previous hackathons.\n\nMetaDAO's aims to evolve DAO governance through \"Futarchy\", a more effective way to align incentives emphasizing decision markets over traditional voting.\n\nMetaDAO plans to offer an improved governance mechanism to other DAOs with its \"Futarchy as a Service\" (FaaS) product.\n\nDespite being in the early stages, the project is already showing potential for growth and Colosseum is backing its commitment with a $250,000 investment into MetaDAO.\n\nThis partnership not only signifies a strong belief in MetaDAO's mission, but also aligns with Colosseum's mission to support Solana projects that bring long-term benefits to developers and projects.\n\nColosseum becomes MetaDAO's first venture investor\n\nüèéÔ∏è Metaplex Core Live on Devnet\n\nMetaplex has become a pillar of the Solana ecosystem, serving as a foundational platform for the creation, sale, and management of NFTs by providing a framework that leverages Solana's high-speed and low-cost transactions.\n\nDespite the success of Metaplex, the underlying Token Metadata (TM) standard it uses is not without limitations, and often resulted in increased complexity and higher costs for minting and managing digital assets.\n\nIt required multiple accounts for each asset to store metadata, the asset itself, and various other components, leading to bloated, inefficient transactions..¬†\n\nIn response to these challenges, Metaplex Core was developed with the goal to redefine the standard for digital asset creation and management on Solana.¬†\n\nMetaplex Core introduces a modern, simplified approach to digital asset creation and management, marked by its cost efficiency, streamlined developer workflows, and enhanced flexibility through an innovative plugin model.¬†\n\nBy consolidating asset data into a single account, dramatically reducing the costs and complexities associated with asset minting and management and reduces the overall transaction load on the network\n\nOne of the most noticeable improvements Metaplex Core brings to the digital asset space is cost efficiency.¬†\n\nWhile minting an NFT using the previous Token Metadata standard could cost around .022 SOL, the same operation via Metaplex Core reduces this expense by almost 90%.¬†\n\nMetaplex Core's objectives are more than just cost reduction. It offers developers advanced features like enhanced collection management, sophisticated plugin support, and out-of-the-box indexing for improved asset discovery.\n\nMetaplex Core introduces an advanced plugin architecture, designed to extend the functionality of digital assets through customizable lifecycle events. This architecture allows developers to implement a wide range of custom behaviors.\n\nFor example, a Transfer Delegate plugin might enable an asset to be transferable only under certain conditions, while a Burn Delegate plugin could restrict the burning of an asset to specific scenarios.¬†\n\nPlugins can be broadly categorized into three types based on their management and application:\n\nOwner Managed Plugins - These plugins can be added or removed by the asset's owner and are typically used for operations that affect the asset's transferability, usability, or other dynamic characteristics.\n\nAuthority Managed Plugins - This category includes plugins that can be controlled by a designated authority, offering functionalities like royalties or metadata updates. These are crucial for assets that require ongoing management or updates beyond the initial creation.\n\nPermanent Plugins - As the name suggests, these plugins are permanently attached to an asset at the time of its creation and cannot be altered thereafter. They are used for defining immutable characteristics or behaviors of the asset.\n\nFor Solana developers, Metaplex Core eases the technical burdens of asset creation and enables more interactive digital experiences.\n\nMetaplex Core: Next Generation Solana NFT Standard\n\nüåâ Circle CCTP Live on Solana\n\nCircle has introduced its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to the Solana ecosystem, enabling developers to swap USDC tokens natively between Ethereum and various EVM-compatible blockchains, as well as non-EVM chains.\n\nThis development makes it easy for developers to transfer USDC across different blockchains in their apps.\n\nPopular Solana projects like Wormhole, Cube Exchange, Jupiter Exchange, Drift Protocol and Sphere Labs are among the first to support CCTP, with more expected to add support soon.\n\nDevelopers that want to implement CCTP in their own apps should refer to the documentation and integration guides provided by Circle and the supported platforms.\n\nSolana welcomes Circle‚Äôs cross-chain transfer protocol\n\n‚ñ∂ Inside the Colosseum: Nurturing Solana‚Äôs Rising Stars\n\nIn the latest episode of Web3 Unpacked, Rich Pasqua of MVMT speaks with Colosseum Co-Founder Clay Robbins about how Colosseum is attracting, accelerating, and investing in the next wave of talented founders in the Solana ecosystem.\n\nüí∞ cHack Winners\n\nThe cHack hackathon has come to a close and the winners have been announced!\n\nThese projects are being recognized for advancing the technology surrounding Solana NFT compression and NFT tooling.\n\nGrand Winner:\n\nTorque (formerly Onnyx) is developing a protocol aimed at creating a decentralized attention economy. It assists developers in initiating on-chain campaigns by utilizing cryptocurrency primitives to achieve wider distribution.\n\nSecond Place:\n\nLightDAS introduces a streamlined Metaplex API designed to let developers index particular Merkle Trees, enabling users to index only the necessary data. This reduction in overhead offers alternative methods for accessing digital assets.\n\nThird Place:\n\nFiltoor offers an open-source solution for filtering NFT spam, featuring a self-hosted model, an API service, and a transaction explorer for comprehensive oversight.\n\nProjects were also judged across several categories:\n\ncBoxes (Gaming) - The cBox program empowers cNFT holders to authorize transactions for their PDA linked to the cNFT, essentially turning the cNFT into a portable wallet. This innovation unlocks exciting prospects, such as enabling characters to have items that can be passed along or the use of loot boxes in games!\n\nMSG.LAND (Consumer) - This decentralized and open network is designed for social postings, allowing you to share up to 1kB of compressed data. These posts are verifiable on-chain and can be made for the same cost as minting a cNFT.\n\nPicobot (Mobile) - This user-friendly Telegram bot for NFT trading bot facilitates an effortless NFT trading process accessible from any device with just a few clicks, catering to NFT traders of all levels.\n\nTeleport Domains (RWAs) - A system designed for buying and selling web2 domains in the form of NFTs.\n\nShaga (DePIN) - Shaga offers a cloud gaming service enabling players to enjoy high-demand games on their personal devices by utilizing remote, high-performance computers. This initiative tackles the shortage of self-custodial technology in web3 gaming.\n\nDev Tooling: Torque (See Grand Winner above)\n\nAnnouncing cHack Winners!\n\nüíé Developer News\n\nSolana Crossroads\nCrossroads, hosted in Istanbul, Turkey on May 10-11, is Solana's premier annual community conference. It's a focal point for developers, community members, ecosystem builders, and crypto enthusiasts to accelerate their growth, expand their networks, and contribute to the Solana ecosystem. The event features a series of educational sessions designed to spark innovation and foster collaboration.\n\nIslandDAO\nScheduled from May 17 to June 14 on the beautiful island of Crete, Greece, this event hosted by IslandDAO and the Solana Foundation fosters a collaborative and immersive experience for attendees. The program includes panels, workshops, and talks with founders and core developers, along with fun networking events such as beach excursions, windsurfing, jet skiing, sailing, site seeing, and golf.\n\nSwitchboard On-Demand\nSwitchboard On-Demand is live on Devnet! Initially, Switchboard used a push-based model, where oracles automatically push price data onto the blockchain without waiting for an actual request from a program. With the shift to an on-demand model, data is only fetched when a request is made by a program. This reduction in transaction volume will also help address congestion issues the Solana network is facing due to high demand.\n\nWhat To Build for Solana DeFi?\nIn 2024, Solana's DeFi landscape experienced a resurgence, marked by growth in TVL ($3.8B), daily volumes ($2.5B), a diverse ecosystem of over 100 quality projects. In this in-depth post, Yash Agarwal highlights the top 10 DeFi themes for developers to build on with relevant examples to explore.\n\nweb3.js Technology Preview 2\nThe second Technology Preview of solana/web3.js introduces a lot of new enhancements, bug fixes, and features since it was announced at Breakpoint in Nov 2023.

    "content": "üéÇ Happy 4th Birthday Solana!\n\nSolana reached a major milestone as it marked the fourth anniversary of its Genesis Block, referred to as Genesis Day by the Solana community.\n\nThis event celebrates the first Mainnet-beta transaction on March 16, 2020.\n\nIn that time, Solana has achieved several significant milestones that underscore its growing influence and success in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors.\n\nSolana's developer community is among the most active in the industry hosting 248 dApps on its platform, according to DappRadar.¬†\n\nThe blockchain's commitment to decentralization with its network of more than 1,600 independent validators.\n\n$SOL holds a position as a Top 5 token by total market capitalization.\n\nSolana has grown dramatically in the DeFi space, with more than $4 billion locked in its DeFi protocols and the fourth largest total value locked (TVL) in DeFi.\n\nü¶õ Block Scheduler Upgrades\n\nYou may have run into issues deploying programs or with transactions failing recently on Solana due to extremely high usage.\n\nIn the current Solana ecosystem, the block scheduler plays a crucial role in managing how transactions are processed, especially within the banking stage where transactions are serialized and executed.\n\nThe existing v1.17 scheduler, which operates with six threads to process the most recent transactions, faces challenges with efficiency due to contention among threads attempting to lock and execute the same transactions simultaneously.\n\nIt‚Äôs kind of like hungry hungry hippos where the six threads are all trying to eat (lock & execute) the same tx. It creates a bit of confusion that takes time to unwind.\n~ Rex St. John (Developer Relations, Anza)\n\nThe upcoming v1.18 release (targeted for April) includes a new scheduler architecture designed to address and overcome these limitations by eliminating the inefficiencies caused by concurrent threads competing for the same transactions.\n\nFor developers, this means a boost in the success rate of transactions, reduced latency, and an overall smoother user experience.\n\nWhile the network has maintained stability during this high usage, there are a number of tools developers can implement today for optimal performance.\n\nBlock Optimization on the Solana Network\n\nFor an in-depth look at how transactions go through the current \"banking stage\", and how the future 1.18 scheduler will work, check out this explainer video with @jacobvcreech and @apfitzge.\n\nüíù Cubik Grants Round 1\n\nCubik is funding public goods through its innovative Cubik Grants Round 1 initiative, leveraging the power of Quadratic Funding to democratize and optimize the allocation of resources within the Solana ecosystem.\n\nQuadratic funding is a crowdfunding mechanism that aims to promote public goods. It works by ensuring that smaller contributors have a greater impact. Using a quadratic formula encourages grassroots support and prevents the domination of funding by a few whales, leading to a more democratic and inclusive funding model.\n\nCubik Grants Round 1 features a matching pool of funds, initially set at $50,000, thanks to contributions from sponsors like the Solana Foundation, Squads, SolBlaze, and others. This pool is used to match the funds raised by individual projects based on the quadratic funding formula, amplifying the impact of individual donations.\n\nCubik provides a platform that encourages innovation and collaborative efforts among developers, creators, and builders.\n\nThe initiative is open to a diverse array of projects within the Solana ecosystem, including those focused on Solana infrastructure, developer tools, DAOs, climate solutions, and more.\n\nAnnouncing: Cubik Grants Round 1\n\nüíé Developer News\n\nA Hitchhiker's Guide to Solana Program Security\nSolana's design, where all accounts must be provided to a program, significantly impacts how developers need to approach program security.\n\nThis guide from Helius is an in-depth exploration of security considerations for Solana developers. It emphasizes the importance of understanding Solana's programming model and the attacker mindset.\n\nETHDenver Solana Hackathon Winners\nSolana had a booth and presence at ETH Denver this year, and developers could take part in the BuidlWeek hackathon to win prizes for the best Solana app.\n\nThe winners were:\n\nServo: A decentralized game server designed for low-latency, competitive two-player games.\n\nMr. Goose: A community platform that incentivizes event participation with rewards and provides unique opportunities for exclusive merchandise.\n\nSwoosh: Offers straightforward and rapid payment solutions by combining traditional fiat and blockchain mechanisms on the Solana platform.\n\nDecentra-Jockey: modernizes the DJ experience for the web3 and XR ages, enhancing audience engagement through on-chain voting mechanisms.\n\nCrypto for Good Fund\nMercy Corps Ventures has initiated the third round of its Crypto for Good Fund, continuing its mission to fund impactful real-world Web3 use cases that address critical global challenges and improve the lives of underserved populations.\n\nThe focus areas for this edition of the Fund include:\n\nDePIN - how can we improve financing for critical physical infrastructure?\nOnramps - how can we onboard more people to financial freedom?\nRWA - how can tokenized assets improve livelihoods?\nHumanitarian aid delivery - how can we serve 299M people in need of aid?\nReFi - how can we promote and restore the environment alongside financial gains?\n\nThese themes underscore an approach to leveraging technology to improve access to critical services, foster environmental sustainability, and expand financial inclusion.\n\nEligible projects from Africa, South and Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Pacific Islands, and Western Balkans can apply for equity-free grants of up to $100,000 along with mentorship, impact measurement advisory, and access to partnership opportunities.,\n\nThe application deadline is set for March 31, 2024.\n\nParallel Creator Details ‚ÄòColony‚Äô AI Game on Solana\nThe team behind the popular Ethereum NFT game Parallel is transitioning to the Solana platform for their upcoming project, a survival simulation game infused with AI technology named \"Colony\".\n\nThe game is distinguished by its use of generative AI, where players interact with NPCs that evolve and make decisions independently.\n\nChoosing Solana over Ethereum highlights Solana's advantages, such as lower transaction fees and fast processing times and could encourage other developers to consider Solana as a viable platform for their projects.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Resources\n\nSolana helpers v2.1 is out and updates include initializeKeypair() to create and fund a keypair, airdropIfRequired() to check balance then airdrop if necessary, and getLogs() to pull up transaction logs in a single function.\n\ndeclare_program! is a PR to add a macro to Anchor to generate a program declaration from the program's IDL. This allows apps to interact with programs, both onchain and offchain, without having to add the program's crate as a dependency.\n\nüíÄ RIP Stockpile\n\nStockpile is shutting down primarily due to a combination of factors identified by its founder, @joeymeere.¬†\n\nDespite some early success, the platform couldn't secure its position as a viable project due to stiff competition, lack of sufficient support, and self-acknowledged shortcomings in both product development and distribution.¬†\n\nJoey expressed concerns over not being able to meet expectations, leading to a series of initiatives that fell short of their goals.¬†\n\nAll in all, I‚Äôm moving on from this better than I was a year ago skill wise\n~ @joeymeere\n\nFor projects currently using the platform, the project will maintain the UI for as long as financially feasible, ensuring that projects and grant rounds already on the platform will remain accessible in the short term.¬†\n\nThe funds associated with these projects are stored in an open protocol, indicating they will be safe and accessible beyond the lifespan of Stockpile Labs itself.¬†\n\nWhile the platform will transition to a maintenance-only mode after completing a few final updates, the promise of acquisition offers and the skills gained by Joey suggest a potential for future developments, albeit under different circumstances or management.\n\nStockpile will be going into maintenance-only mode\n\n‚ö° Quick Hits\n\nHooked!

    "content": "A guide to successfully navigating crypto‚Äôs most competitive hackathon.\n\nHistorically, hackathons have provided builders the environment to experiment with new technologies, collaborate with peers, and complete bounties offered by sponsors. Hackathons usually take place over 24-72 hours in offline locations like high school gyms, university computer labs, or conference centers.\n\nEven though these events serve an important role in modern engineering culture and involve consuming copious amounts of Red Bull, they do not consistently result in dedicated teams building viable or long-lasting products.\n\nThis is why Solana Foundation, and now Colosseum, hackathons are not structured like traditional hackathons. While Solana and crypto broadly need to grow the total number of ecosystem developers, we believe it is much more important to specifically grow the number of full-time founders shipping products. As more startups launch, competition drives better product experiences for end users and increases the likelihood of breakout successes bringing the world onchain.\n\nAligning with that mission, Colosseum has evolved hackathons across several dimensions (while still preserving principles of experimentation and innovation):\n\nLocation: Colosseum hackathons will always be online, rather than IRL. We provide a level playing field for builders globally to compete and show their potential to build impactful crypto startups.\nLength: Colosseum hackathons are 5 weeks long to give teams enough time to complete a full engineering sprint in order to reach Solana devnet. Also, while projects are judged just on the work completed during the hackathon, participants can start building 2 months prior to the start date.\nBounties: Builders should bring their own creative product ideas that they envision working on for the next decade. So, we removed specific bounties and tech requirements (other than integrating with Solana in some capacity).\nJudging: Given our goal of increasing ecosystem startups, prizes will be awarded to teams who intend to build full-time and develop products with potentially viable business models (although, there will always be an award for the best public good).\n\nGiven those differences, we wrote this guide to provide all builders advice on how to successfully compete for hackathon prizes and ultimately become eligible to join Colosseum‚Äôs accelerator. The guide includes recommendations regarding:\n\nTeam Composition\nProduct Ideation\nPrioritization & Execution\nProduct Presentation\n\nWhile we can‚Äôt guarantee that your project will be selected as a winner in our upcoming competition, following this guide will set you and your team up for success.\n\nHackathon Builder Demographics¬†\n\nBefore diving in, it is important to note that this guide applies to all types of builders who join Solana hackathons, which we categorized into 3 levels:\n\nLearners: New crypto developers who participate in our hackathons to learn and experiment with blockchain technology.\nContributors: Developers who do not intend to become startup founders, but build useful tools to add to their resumes, and aim to get recruited by current ecosystem companies.\nFounders: Ambitious builders and founding teams who use our hackathon as an engineering and business sprint to launch their new crypto startups.\n\nThe structure, messaging, and purpose of Solana‚Äôs hackathons have evolved to specifically attract new Founders who have the talent to build the next era of category-defining crypto products and infrastructure. This is why Colosseum primarily focuses on supporting Founders through our accelerator program, where they get access to our mentor network, pre-seed funding, private platform features, and more.\n\nHowever, both Learners and Contributors are highly encouraged to participate. Colosseum‚Äôs online platform and hackathon provide a great starting point for these builders as well. Over the past 3 years of Solana hackathons, we have observed that Learners often become Contributors and Contributors often become Founders. There are also grants available to bolster open-source projects, even if the creators have no intention to commit to a startup full-time.\n\nTeam Composition\n\nHackathons are known for being developer-only events. Colosseum hackathons are different. Many previous winning products were built by teams who had both technical and non-technical cofounders. In addition to developers, Colosseum is a community for entrepreneurs with experience in Marketing, Finance, Operations, Design, Product Management, and many other roles. However, non-technical entrepreneurs should team up with a technical lead to compete in our hackathons, as they are equally engineering competitions as they are business competitions.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a solo dev or founder, we highly encourage joining forces with at least 1 other cofounder. Building a new crypto startup will be an emotional rollercoaster. A compatible cofounder can provide support during the most difficult moments, as well as grounding during the most euphoric moments. Also, our hackathons are competitive, with the average winning team size now above 3. All projects need to divide up work to increase output during the hackathon for a shot at winning a prize.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for teammates, the first place to explore is your existing network, as there could be a good cofounder match amongst your friends and colleagues. The second place to check is Colosseum‚Äôs Cofounder Directory, where you can connect with other builders before the next hackathon. Building a hackathon project with a potential cofounder is a great way to test the working relationship before committing long-term.\n\nProduct Ideation\n\nMany blog posts explain how to find startup ideas (and despite what you may have been told, nobody knows which startup ideas will succeed or not). We won‚Äôt rehash all of those approaches in this guide, but we do highlight 5 pieces of advice:\n\nBuild products that enable new markets that couldn‚Äôt exist without crypto or improve existing markets by bringing them onchain. Crypto at its core unlocks new markets fueled by digitally-native assets. This was originally exemplified by Bitcoin, which unlocked a new market for a non-sovereign store of value. Crypto can also be leveraged to improve existing markets by removing middlemen and coordinating resources more efficiently. Hivemapper, for instance, is improving the market to purchase and supply up-to-date mapping data by incentivizing regular people to map their localities through its network.\nBuild products that solve problems that affect you personally. Think about products you wished you had in your life, even if they may seem very niche to your interests. Some products that on the surface only serve a niche community can capture a global market if that community is growing rapidly. A good example is Tensor. The founders of Tensor built a pro trading platform for NFTs because it solved pain points they personally had with the existing NFT marketplaces designed for retail. The community of prosumer NFT traders and collectors was small initially but was growing quickly and accounted for the majority of trading volume, enabling Tensor to grow in lockstep to capture market share.\nBuild products in markets where you have prior experience. To deeply understand the market opportunity of a product idea, builders should have domain expertise in that general vertical. A common piece of advice on reaching product-market fit is that teams need to start with strong founder-market fit.\nDon‚Äôt be afraid to build products that have been attempted before. Timing and execution matter a lot in startups. There have been many startups with good ideas, but were just too early or were not effective at building the particular product. If you have the passion, expertise, and deep understanding of how others failed, you may have a unique insight and ability that leads to success.\nBuild wildly ambitious products. If you decide to embark on a new startup journey, make sure to choose a product vision that will lead to a long-term adventure. The hackathon is just the start of your journey and only so much can be accomplished within the 5 week hackathon. That is intentional and leads to the following section on how to prioritize your sprint and execute initially on your product vision.\n\nColosseum‚Äôs platform features an active product forum where builders can explore potential product ideas or pressure test their own with the community before the hackathon commences.\n\nPrioritization & Execution\n\nOnce you have a team and a product idea, it‚Äôs time to start planning your hackathon sprint. If you have a sufficiently ambitious vision for your product, you obviously won‚Äôt have enough time during the hackathon to build out all of the features. Therefore, you need to prioritize. But how? Simply put, prioritize the features that allow you to create an amazing working demo on devnet. Prioritize the features that you believe will give users an ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment where they understand why your product fulfills their needs and how they will use it on a frequent basis.\n\nColosseum hackathons are 5 weeks long, so we recommend spending at least 4 of the weeks on the engineering sprint to ensure you achieve a working demo, as well as iterating on your product based on initial user feedback. The final week should be spent on testing the demo to ensure functionality and creating the submission presentation pitch (more on the presentation below).\n\nFinally, we strongly recommend that hackathon participants build in the open from the start. After registering for the hackathon, create a project Twitter X account and begin sharing your product vision with the crypto community. The reason is twofold. First, it forces you to start marketing your product, and second (even more importantly) it enables you to find beta testers who will provide feedback during the engineering sprint. Initial users can significantly alter the direction of a project, so incorporating feedback early on in the hackathon is valuable.\n\nProduct Presentation\n\nThe final presentation is critical since there are hundreds of product submissions in Solana‚Äôs online hackathons. Builders can find all the information required during the product submission process within the FAQs, but the product presentation slide deck and video are the most important component in rising above the crowd.\n\nIn the final week of the hackathon, the focus should center on the presentation video (we recommend using Loom over a slide deck). Effective pitches always include:\n\nTeam background\nProduct description\nWhy you started building the product\nThe potential market opportunity unlocked by your product\nHow you will get initial product usage (or if applicable, the traction and user feedback already received)\nHow the product works (your demo)\n\nJudges have to review hundreds of project submissions, so presentations are required to be under 3 minutes. As you practice your presentation recording, be concise when telling your product story, walking through your demo, and explaining why it is destined to become the next breakout crypto product.\n\nFinal Words\n\nGiven that Solana‚Äôs online hackathons are historically the largest in the world, they are extremely competitive and judging is a difficult task. There are usually 40 individual prizes per hackathon and every submission in the top 100 is typically exceptional in their own way. So for those who don‚Äôt make the cut for prizes or our accelerator initially, we encourage you to keep building. Developers often enter multiple hackathons before being selected as a winner, as it can take time to explore the idea maze and iterate to find the right product with the right teammates.\n\nFor founders who end up winning and being accepted into the accelerator program, congratulations on a monumental achievement. Know that our founder community will welcome you and that you can rely on Colosseum throughout your startup journey.\n\nWe hope this guide is helpful to all builders who participate in future Colosseum hackathons, and godspeed to all crypto builders working to grow the crypto economy.\n\nThanks to Mert Mumtaz, Richard Wu, and Ian Krotinsky for their feedback on this blog post.",

    "content": "Colosseum launches to run Solana's hackathons, accelerate winning founders, and invest in the next generation of breakout crypto startups.\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the launch of Colosseum!\n\nCrypto is at an inflection point. Much of the promising experimentation has been confined to a small and often volatile corner of the internet, constrained by a lack of scalable infrastructure for developers and end users. In parallel, Solana has innovated substantially at the base layer to allow the next wave of crypto products to grow far beyond the existing market.\n\nColosseum‚Äôs mission is to consistently generate those waves by tapping into the immense well of global builder talent and empowering founders who have the ability to launch the next era of products that bring the world onchain.\n\nSign up today at colosseum.org\n\nColosseum is an independent organization composed of three integrated pillars:\n\nHackathon: Colosseum will run 2-3 online hackathons per year for the Solana Foundation and the broader ecosystem. These online competitions have proven to be a crucible of innovation for the crypto ecosystem. Our five-week hackathon provides a level playing field for new teams globally to showcase their potential to build impactful products. Cofounding ecosystem teams have historically used Solana's hackathons as their initial engineering sprint to kickstart product development.\nAccelerator: Colosseum‚Äôs Accelerator is an online, five-week program specifically designed for Hackathon winners to immerse themselves in the Solana ecosystem. They will join an elite founder network, access a diverse customer base, receive 1:1 mentorship, and receive ongoing educational content. Accelerator cohorts will run directly following each Hackathon, consisting of a subset of winners in each batch. Participating in a Colosseum Hackathon and being selected as a winner is the only way to be considered for the program.\nVenture Fund: The teams accepted into the Accelerator program will receive a pre-seed $250,000 investment from Colosseum on founder-friendly terms. Additionally, Accelerator teams will receive assistance on a consistent basis as they continue to develop their products and raise future rounds of funding. The program culminates in a Demo Day where the founders will pitch to dozens of leading venture funds and get direct introductions.\n\nFor founders who are not accepted into the Accelerator initially, we encourage you to keep building. Developers often enter multiple Hackathons before being selected as a winner. It can take time to iterate to find the right product with the right teammates.\n\nFor founders who are accepted, Colosseum‚Äôs support doesn‚Äôt end after Demo Day. At Colosseum‚Äôs core is a founder and alumni community that you can rely on throughout your journey. Teams will continue to have access to all of the private tools, discussion boards, and other features included in Colosseum‚Äôs online platform.\n\nThe Colosseum Team\n\nColosseum is cofounded by Matty Taylor, Clay Robbins, and Nate Levine. Our team will be there for founders by supporting them through our hackathons, the accelerator program, and beyond.\n\nMatty was the Head of Growth at the Solana Foundation, where he kickstarted the Solana hackathon program in 2020. Over the past three years, that program cumulatively resulted in over 60,000 participants, 4,000 projects launched, and $600 million in venture funding for winners. Top Solana ecosystem founders from Tensor, Squads, StepN, Jito, and dozens of other leading projects got their start through Solana Foundation hackathons. Matty previously worked at 0x Labs and Square.\n\nClay was a Principal at Slow Ventures, one of Solana‚Äôs first investors. He helped lead the firm‚Äôs crypto investing efforts and has been an active angel investor in the ecosystem through many market cycles. Prior to Slow, he was a product and growth-focused operator at 0x Labs and Square. Clay and Matty met on their first day working at Square, and are back working together for a third time after daily text threads weren‚Äôt cutting it.¬†\n\nNate was a Software Engineer at Stripe, where he worked most recently on their Crypto team. While at Stripe, he built developer tools and API infrastructure responsible for moving billions of dollars per day. Previously, Nate led engineering teams at LendUp, a YC-backed fintech startup. Nate and Matty went to college together, where they spent much of their senior year discussing Bitcoin.\n\nBeyond support from our team, Colosseum has partnered with leading ecosystem developers and founders, many of whom were previous hackathon winners. Founders will receive extensive mentorship and guidance during the Accelerator program, and become part of an exclusive founder community.\n\nEvolving Solana Foundation Hackathons\n\nSolana‚Äôs hackathons started small, but have grown to be the largest recurring hackathons not only in crypto but in the entire technology space in terms of the number of participants, product submissions, and venture funding raised by winners. To give a sense of their impact, 80% of all venture-backed startups in the Solana ecosystem started in the online hackathons.\n\nHowever, there is still a massive opportunity to scale ecosystem hackathons well beyond where they are today. Therefore, the Solana Foundation will be ending its internally managed hackathon efforts and is partnering with Colosseum to fulfill this vision.\n\nWe believe this is a positive step in decentralizing hackathons for the Solana ecosystem. Additionally, it allows Colosseum‚Äôs team to work more closely with peers in the ecosystem to further grow the hackathon platform.\n\nWith an independent team dedicated to running the Foundation's hackathons and integrating an accelerator experience for winners, Colosseum will substantially improve these global competitions and the outcomes for the teams that participate in them. There are a few key areas we are focused on initially:\n\nOnline Platform: We attempted to use off-the-shelf services, as well as stitch together many separate components to run hackathons. Neither were effective solutions, as the Solana Foundation‚Äôs hackathons have evolved to the point where they are not administered like any traditional hackathon. Instead, we‚Äôve built our own custom platform that streamlines everything from finding cofounders to discussing product ideas to submitting hackathon projects. Founders in our Accelerator will also get access to an exclusive set of features that will assist them as they kickstart their journey. If you‚Äôre a builder looking to join the next hackathon, create a Colosseum profile now.\nCollaboration: One of Colosseum‚Äôs goals is to embed the broader ecosystem directly into the competitions. Therefore, we are actively working with a cross-section of companies, ecosystem developers, and investors who can contribute to judging and sponsorship. If you‚Äôre interested in working with us, please get in touch.\nSupport: There has been a lack of support for talented teams post-hackathon to help further their development, as well as assist with fundraising. Colosseum‚Äôs Accelerator fills that gap by selecting hackathon winners to join the program and help them early on in their startup journey. While Solana Foundation hackathons are first and foremost startup competitions, we understand that many participants are not interested in becoming founders. We intend to support that group of developers as well through our online platform and discussion forums.\n\nImproving these hackathons is an evolving process and we want to work with the community to understand both the pain points and opportunities. So if you have any feedback, please reach out.\n\nGet Started\n\nIf you‚Äôre an ambitious crypto developer, founder, or team interested in competing in the next Solana Foundation hackathon starting on March 4, sign up for a Colosseum account here. Registration for the hackathon will open on the platform in a few weeks.\n\nWe‚Äôll be making platform upgrades and a few important announcements about the next hackathon soon, so be sure to follow @Colosseum on X for updates.",
