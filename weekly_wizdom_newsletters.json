Last week's main data release was Non-Farm payrolls, which was a miss compared to expectations; however, the unemployment rate came out slightly better. We have US inflation data today, with core inflation expected at 3.1% YoY and inflation unchanged from last month at 2.9% YoY. Additionally, Powell is also speaking today, and next Wednesday, we have FOMC minutes - these will be crucial for rate cut expectations, which have dropped to just one cut for the rest of the year.  \n\nThis week, our technical analysis focuses on the following crypto tickers: TAOBTC, AR, JTO, HYPE, SOL, and LINK. For equities, we offer trade ideas for Gold and MP. Read on to learn all about understanding the Fed. Follow our analysts' ideas carefully, take note of the suggested levels, and stick to the plan! Enjoy, and happy trading! \n\nAFRM (Donny): Fresh off a big win in OKLO the week before, we nailed our AFRM entry in the week leading up to its Q4 earnings release. Gained entry at $57 with the stock now at $78 (36% unlevered return in 2 weeks, including 21% on earnings release date).\n\nTAO (Crypto Fox): Telegram limit long bid at 393$ hit 437$ for an 11.22% unleveraged move to the upside - 4.2R (sl being 382.5$)\n\nLast week, we discussed the concept of Global Liquidity. If you haven’t read it yet, we recommend reading it HERE.\n\nIn this episode, we’ll review how the Fed works and how macro events tie into the market.\n\nUnderstanding The Fed\n\nThe Fed or Federal Reserve is the U.S. Central Bank. Their job is to “manage” the economy.\n\nThe FED works with what they call a ‘Dual Mandate.’ They want to keep inflation “low” around 2% while at the same time maintaining unemployment low (i.e., everyone has a job).\n\nThey achieve this through a few primary tools. Let’s discuss those tools and how they affect our lovely asset markets.\n\nFed Funds Rate\nThe Fed sets the interest rate on bank loans. While the entire system is highly convoluted, the effect can simply be described as making money expensive by raising rates or cheap by lowering them.\n\n\nWhen interest rates are low, money flows easily, stimulating economic activity. During periods of low rates, many companies borrow and push for growth. This boosts profits, helps companies expand, and, most notably for the Fed, results in hiring.\n\nIn other words, lower unemployment means more people with jobs. However, aggressive spending and easy money can also cause inflation.\n\n\nWhen they raise interest rates, they are intentionally slowing economic activity. Borrowing is more expensive, it’s harder to get cheap money, and companies and consumers tend to be more frugal during these periods.\n\nAfter all, if you can’t pay your debts, you go under. As a result, you’ll often see layoffs during periods of high interest rates. This is reflected in the tech sector (a high growth sector) where tens-of-thousands of people got laid off.\n\nSo why do it? To control inflation. Slowing the economy will encourage people to spend less. When people spend less, companies cannot sell or charge as much, and when companies don’t make much money, their suppliers do less, too. It trickles down, and people stop raising prices. (In theory, of course)\n\n\nQuantitative Easing/Tightening\n\n\nAnother way the Fed can stimulate or slow down the economy is through QE or QT.\n\nDuring Quantitative Easing, the Fed buys assets, lowers rates, and uses everything on its toolbelt to inject liquidity into the economy.\n\nThis boost in liquidity can result in amazing rallies in crypto and markets. QE fueled the 2020-2021 bull run, so everything went crazy.\n\nHowever, by November 2021, the Fed had started Quantitative Tightening, essentially the opposite of QE. This policy effectively reduced liquidity conditions, nuking asset markets.\n\n\nForward Guidance\nThe goofiest of their tools is their Forward Guidance. By telling the world what they plan to do ahead, investors, traders, and companies will make financial decisions based on those plans.\n\nSo, when they want things to slow down, rather than immediately raising rates, they might tell the world, “We’re raising rates by this much over this period.”\n\nThis has resulted in the entire U.S. Stock market and crypto swinging everywhere when some old man speaks.\n\n\nRelevance\n\nWhat do we, as investors/traders, need to know? It’s simple: If the Fed says it will actively raise rates or start QT, we want to be more risk-off.\n\nWhen the Fed says they’ll cut rates and perform QE, we want to be risk-on.\n\nWhile we can sit here and worry about every FOMC meeting and every CPI / Unemployment report, we must focus on the big picture. Will this increase or decrease liquidity conditions?\n\nSo, where do Inflation & Unemployment come in? Why do people care?\n\nInflation Rate (CPI / PCE / PPI)\nA few measures track the Inflation rate, but here’s what you need to know.\n\nMost people will hear about the ‘Headline Inflation’ number. It is simply a measure of how much more expensive prices are this month compared to the same prices a year ago.\n\nNote: A common misconception is that inflation going down means things are becoming cheaper. This is not the case. Inflation measures the ‘rate of change’. Prices are still going up, just not as fast.\n\n“The damage has already been done, but don’t worry; future damage will happen more slowly.”\n\nSo why should any investor or trader care about the inflation rate? Some investors look to the inflation rate to better judge what the Fed will do next. If inflation is out of control, they’re more likely to raise rates to slow inflation. (And in doing so, lower liquidity. \n\nKnowing the intricacies of each type of inflation measure is relatively pointless as a trader. It is only relevant to understand what actions the Fed might take.\n\n\nUnemployment\nUnemployment is just a measure of the number of people unemployed. Recessions occur when the rate gets too high and everyone loses their jobs. The Fed would like to avoid that.\n\nIf it gets out of control, the Fed will likely take action and stimulate the economy, which will benefit our markets. \n\nRegarding macro news, focus on the big picture, don’t worry too much about timing, and remember that the market’s reaction is much more important than the specific number.\n\nIf the chart is bullish, even with weak macro data, we follow it. However, a major shift in the Fed’s policy can be an early signal that things could change significantly.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nhttps://www.jw.com/news/insights-energy-policy-executive-orders/\n\nhttps://www.woodmac.com/blogs/energy-pulse/president-trumps-orders-on-energy/\n\nhttps://eelp.law.harvard.edu/trumps-environmental-and-energy-executive-orders-initial-insights-and-what-were-watching/\n\nhttps://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/research-in-focus-trump-sets-clear-tone-on-energy-policy/\n\nhttps://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/alerts/2025/1/trumps-first-day-executive-orders-a-mixed-bag-for-energy-sectors/\n\nDisclaimer  \n\nWizard of Soho LLC and Weekly Wizdom publish financial information based on research and opinion.

Slowing the economy will encourage people to spend less. When people spend less, companies cannot sell or charge as much, and when companies don’t make much money, their suppliers do less, too. It trickles down, and people stop raising prices. (In theory, of course)\n\n\nQuantitative Easing/Tightening\n\n\nAnother way the Fed can stimulate or slow down the economy is through QE or QT.\n\nDuring Quantitative Easing, the Fed buys assets, lowers rates, and uses everything on its toolbelt to inject liquidity into the economy.\n\nThis boost in liquidity can result in amazing rallies in crypto and markets. QE fueled the 2020-2021 bull run, so everything went crazy.\n\nHowever, by November 2021, the Fed had started Quantitative Tightening, essentially the opposite of QE. This policy effectively reduced liquidity conditions, nuking asset markets.\n\n\nForward Guidance\nThe goofiest of their tools is their Forward Guidance. By telling the world what they plan to do ahead, investors, traders, and companies will make financial decisions based on those plans.\n\nSo, when they want things to slow down, rather than immediately raising rates, they might tell the world, “We’re raising rates by this much over this period.”\n\nThis has resulted in the entire U.S. Stock market and crypto swinging everywhere when some old man speaks.\n\n\nRelevance\n\nWhat do we, as investors/traders, need to know? It’s simple: If the Fed says it will actively raise rates or start QT, we want to be more risk-off.\n\nWhen the Fed says they’ll cut rates and perform QE, we want to be risk-on.\n\nWhile we can sit here and worry about every FOMC meeting and every CPI / Unemployment report, we must focus on the big picture. Will this increase or decrease liquidity conditions?\n\nSo, where do Inflation & Unemployment come in? Why do people care?\n\nInflation Rate (CPI / PCE / PPI)\nA few measures track the Inflation rate, but here’s what you need to know.\n\nMost people will hear about the ‘Headline Inflation’ number. It is simply a measure of how much more expensive prices are this month compared to the same prices a year ago.\n\nNote: A common misconception is that inflation going down means things are becoming cheaper. This is not the case. Inflation measures the ‘rate of change’. Prices are still going up, just not as fast.\n\n“The damage has already been done, but don’t worry; future damage will happen more slowly.”\n\nSo why should any investor or trader care about the inflation rate? Some investors look to the inflation rate to better judge what the Fed will do next. If inflation is out of control, they’re more likely to raise rates to slow inflation. (And in doing so, lower liquidity. \n\nKnowing the intricacies of each type of inflation measure is relatively pointless as a trader. It is only relevant to understand what actions the Fed might take.\n\n\nUnemployment\nUnemployment is just a measure of the number of people unemployed. Recessions occur when the rate gets too high and everyone loses their jobs. The Fed would like to avoid that.\n\nIf it gets out of control, the Fed will likely take action and stimulate the economy, which will benefit our markets. \n\nRegarding macro news, focus on the big picture, don’t worry too much about timing, and remember that the market’s reaction is much more important than the specific number.\n\nIf the chart is bullish, even with weak macro data, we follow it. However, a major shift in the Fed’s policy can be an early signal that things could change significantly.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nhttps://www.jw.com/news/insights-energy-policy-executive-orders/\n\nhttps://www.woodmac.com/blogs/energy-pulse/president-trumps-orders-on-energy/\n\nhttps://eelp.law.harvard.edu/trumps-environmental-and-energy-executive-orders-initial-insights-and-what-were-watching/\n\nhttps://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/research-in-focus-trump-sets-clear-tone-on-energy-policy/\n\nhttps://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/alerts/2025/1/trumps-first-day-executive-orders-a-mixed-bag-for-energy-sectors/\n\nDisclaimer  \n\nWizard of Soho LLC and Weekly Wizdom publish financial information based on research and opinion.

Last week's main data release was Non-Farm payrolls, which was a miss compared to expectations; however, the unemployment rate came out slightly better. We have US inflation data today, with core inflation expected at 3.1% YoY and inflation unchanged from last month at 2.9% YoY. Additionally, Powell is also speaking today, and next Wednesday, we have FOMC minutes - these will be crucial for rate cut expectations, which have dropped to just one cut for the rest of the year.  \n\nThis week, our technical analysis focuses on the following crypto tickers: TAOBTC, AR, JTO, HYPE, SOL, and LINK. For equities, we offer trade ideas for Gold and MP. Read on to learn all about understanding the Fed. Follow our analysts' ideas carefully, take note of the suggested levels, and stick to the plan! Enjoy, and happy trading! \n\nAFRM (Donny): Fresh off a big win in OKLO the week before, we nailed our AFRM entry in the week leading up to its Q4 earnings release. Gained entry at $57 with the stock now at $78 (36% unlevered return in 2 weeks, including 21% on earnings release date).\n\nTAO (Crypto Fox): Telegram limit long bid at 393$ hit 437$ for an 11.22% unleveraged move to the upside - 4.2R (sl being 382.5$)\n\nLast week, we discussed the concept of Global Liquidity. If you haven’t read it yet, we recommend reading it HERE.\n\nIn this episode, we’ll review how the Fed works and how macro events tie into the market.\n\nUnderstanding The Fed\n\nThe Fed or Federal Reserve is the U.S. Central Bank. Their job is to “manage” the economy.\n\nThe FED works with what they call a ‘Dual Mandate.’ They want to keep inflation “low” around 2% while at the same time maintaining unemployment low (i.e., everyone has a job).\n\nThey achieve this through a few primary tools. Let’s discuss those tools and how they affect our lovely asset markets.\n\nFed Funds Rate\nThe Fed sets the interest rate on bank loans. While the entire system is highly convoluted, the effect can simply be described as making money expensive by raising rates or cheap by lowering them.\n\n\nWhen interest rates are low, money flows easily, stimulating economic activity. During periods of low rates, many companies borrow and push for growth. This boosts profits, helps companies expand, and, most notably for the Fed, results in hiring.\n\nIn other words, lower unemployment means more people with jobs. However, aggressive spending and easy money can also cause inflation.\n\n\nWhen they raise interest rates, they are intentionally slowing economic activity. Borrowing is more expensive, it’s harder to get cheap money, and companies and consumers tend to be more frugal during these periods.\n\nAfter all, if you can’t pay your debts, you go under. As a result, you’ll often see layoffs during periods of high interest rates. This is reflected in the tech sector (a high growth sector) where tens-of-thousands of people got laid off.\n\nSo why do it? To control inflation.

Last week's main data release was Non-Farm payrolls, which was a miss compared to expectations; however, the unemployment rate came out slightly better. We have US inflation data today, with core inflation expected at 3.1% YoY and inflation unchanged from last month at 2.9% YoY. Additionally, Powell is also speaking today, and next Wednesday, we have FOMC minutes - these will be crucial for rate cut expectations, which have dropped to just one cut for the rest of the year.  \n\nThis week, our technical analysis focuses on the following crypto tickers: TAOBTC, AR, JTO, HYPE, SOL, and LINK. For equities, we offer trade ideas for Gold and MP. Read on to learn all about understanding the Fed. Follow our analysts' ideas carefully, take note of the suggested levels, and stick to the plan! Enjoy, and happy trading! \n\nAFRM (Donny): Fresh off a big win in OKLO the week before, we nailed our AFRM entry in the week leading up to its Q4 earnings release. Gained entry at $57 with the stock now at $78 (36% unlevered return in 2 weeks, including 21% on earnings release date).\n\nTAO (Crypto Fox): Telegram limit long bid at 393$ hit 437$ for an 11.22% unleveraged move to the upside - 4.2R (sl being 382.5$)\n\nLast week, we discussed the concept of Global Liquidity. If you haven’t read it yet, we recommend reading it HERE.\n\nIn this episode, we’ll review how the Fed works and how macro events tie into the market.\n\nUnderstanding The Fed\n\nThe Fed or Federal Reserve is the U.S. Central Bank. Their job is to “manage” the economy.\n\nThe FED works with what they call a ‘Dual Mandate.’ They want to keep inflation “low” around 2% while at the same time maintaining unemployment low (i.e., everyone has a job).\n\nThey achieve this through a few primary tools. Let’s discuss those tools and how they affect our lovely asset markets.\n\nFed Funds Rate\nThe Fed sets the interest rate on bank loans. While the entire system is highly convoluted, the effect can simply be described as making money expensive by raising rates or cheap by lowering them.\n\n\nWhen interest rates are low, money flows easily, stimulating economic activity. During periods of low rates, many companies borrow and push for growth. This boosts profits, helps companies expand, and, most notably for the Fed, results in hiring.\n\nIn other words, lower unemployment means more people with jobs. However, aggressive spending and easy money can also cause inflation.\n\n\nWhen they raise interest rates, they are intentionally slowing economic activity. Borrowing is more expensive, it’s harder to get cheap money, and companies and consumers tend to be more frugal during these periods.\n\nAfter all, if you can’t pay your debts, you go under. As a result, you’ll often see layoffs during periods of high interest rates. This is reflected in the tech sector (a high growth sector) where tens-of-thousands of people got laid off.\n\nSo why do it? To control inflation. Slowing the economy will encourage people to spend less. When people spend less, companies cannot sell or charge as much, and when companies don’t make much money, their suppliers do less, too. It trickles down, and people stop raising prices. (In theory, of course)\n\n\nQuantitative Easing/Tightening\n\n\nAnother way the Fed can stimulate or slow down the economy is through QE or QT.\n\nDuring Quantitative Easing, the Fed buys assets, lowers rates, and uses everything on its toolbelt to inject liquidity into the economy.\n\nThis boost in liquidity can result in amazing rallies in crypto and markets. QE fueled the 2020-2021 bull run, so everything went crazy.\n\nHowever, by November 2021, the Fed had started Quantitative Tightening, essentially the opposite of QE. This policy effectively reduced liquidity conditions, nuking asset markets.\n\n\nForward Guidance\nThe goofiest of their tools is their Forward Guidance. By telling the world what they plan to do ahead, investors, traders, and companies will make financial decisions based on those plans.\n\nSo, when they want things to slow down, rather than immediately raising rates, they might tell the world, “We’re raising rates by this much over this period.”\n\nThis has resulted in the entire U.S. Stock market and crypto swinging everywhere when some old man speaks.\n\n\nRelevance\n\nWhat do we, as investors/traders, need to know? It’s simple: If the Fed says it will actively raise rates or start QT, we want to be more risk-off.\n\nWhen the Fed says they’ll cut rates and perform QE, we want to be risk-on.\n\nWhile we can sit here and worry about every FOMC meeting and every CPI / Unemployment report, we must focus on the big picture. Will this increase or decrease liquidity conditions?\n\nSo, where do Inflation & Unemployment come in? Why do people care?\n\nInflation Rate (CPI / PCE / PPI)\nA few measures track the Inflation rate, but here’s what you need to know.\n\nMost people will hear about the ‘Headline Inflation’ number. It is simply a measure of how much more expensive prices are this month compared to the same prices a year ago.\n\nNote: A common misconception is that inflation going down means things are becoming cheaper. This is not the case. Inflation measures the ‘rate of change’. Prices are still going up, just not as fast.\n\n“The damage has already been done, but don’t worry; future damage will happen more slowly.”\n\nSo why should any investor or trader care about the inflation rate? Some investors look to the inflation rate to better judge what the Fed will do next. If inflation is out of control, they’re more likely to raise rates to slow inflation. (And in doing so, lower liquidity. \n\nKnowing the intricacies of each type of inflation measure is relatively pointless as a trader. It is only relevant to understand what actions the Fed might take.\n\n\nUnemployment\nUnemployment is just a measure of the number of people unemployed. Recessions occur when the rate gets too high and everyone loses their jobs. The Fed would like to avoid that.\n\nIf it gets out of control, the Fed will likely take action and stimulate the economy, which will benefit our markets. \n\nRegarding macro news, focus on the big picture, don’t worry too much about timing, and remember that the market’s reaction is much more important than the specific number.\n\nIf the chart is bullish, even with weak macro data, we follow it. However, a major shift in the Fed’s policy can be an early signal that things could change significantly.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nhttps://www.jw.com/news/insights-energy-policy-executive-orders/\n\nhttps://www.woodmac.com/blogs/energy-pulse/president-trumps-orders-on-energy/\n\nhttps://eelp.law.harvard.edu/trumps-environmental-and-energy-executive-orders-initial-insights-and-what-were-watching/\n\nhttps://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/research-in-focus-trump-sets-clear-tone-on-energy-policy/\n\nhttps://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/alerts/2025/1/trumps-first-day-executive-orders-a-mixed-bag-for-energy-sectors/\n\nDisclaimer  \n\nWizard of Soho LLC and Weekly Wizdom publish financial information based on research and opinion.

However, aggressive spending and easy money can also cause inflation.\n\n\nWhen they raise interest rates, they are intentionally slowing economic activity. Borrowing is more expensive, it’s harder to get cheap money, and companies and consumers tend to be more frugal during these periods.\n\nAfter all, if you can’t pay your debts, you go under. As a result, you’ll often see layoffs during periods of high interest rates. This is reflected in the tech sector (a high growth sector) where tens-of-thousands of people got laid off.\n\nSo why do it? To control inflation. Slowing the economy will encourage people to spend less. When people spend less, companies cannot sell or charge as much, and when companies don’t make much money, their suppliers do less, too. It trickles down, and people stop raising prices. (In theory, of course)\n\n\nQuantitative Easing/Tightening\n\n\nAnother way the Fed can stimulate or slow down the economy is through QE or QT.\n\nDuring Quantitative Easing, the Fed buys assets, lowers rates, and uses everything on its toolbelt to inject liquidity into the economy.\n\nThis boost in liquidity can result in amazing rallies in crypto and markets. QE fueled the 2020-2021 bull run, so everything went crazy.\n\nHowever, by November 2021, the Fed had started Quantitative Tightening, essentially the opposite of QE. This policy effectively reduced liquidity conditions, nuking asset markets.\n\n\nForward Guidance\nThe goofiest of their tools is their Forward Guidance. By telling the world what they plan to do ahead, investors, traders, and companies will make financial decisions based on those plans.\n\nSo, when they want things to slow down, rather than immediately raising rates, they might tell the world, “We’re raising rates by this much over this period.”\n\nThis has resulted in the entire U.S. Stock market and crypto swinging everywhere when some old man speaks.\n\n\nRelevance\n\nWhat do we, as investors/traders, need to know? It’s simple: If the Fed says it will actively raise rates or start QT, we want to be more risk-off.\n\nWhen the Fed says they’ll cut rates and perform QE, we want to be risk-on.\n\nWhile we can sit here and worry about every FOMC meeting and every CPI / Unemployment report, we must focus on the big picture. Will this increase or decrease liquidity conditions?\n\nSo, where do Inflation & Unemployment come in? Why do people care?\n\nInflation Rate (CPI / PCE / PPI)\nA few measures track the Inflation rate, but here’s what you need to know.\n\nMost people will hear about the ‘Headline Inflation’ number. It is simply a measure of how much more expensive prices are this month compared to the same prices a year ago.\n\nNote: A common misconception is that inflation going down means things are becoming cheaper. This is not the case. Inflation measures the ‘rate of change’. Prices are still going up, just not as fast.\n\n“The damage has already been done, but don’t worry; future damage will happen more slowly.”\n\nSo why should any investor or trader care about the inflation rate? Some investors look to the inflation rate to better judge what the Fed will do next. If inflation is out of control, they’re more likely to raise rates to slow inflation. (And in doing so, lower liquidity. \n\nKnowing the intricacies of each type of inflation measure is relatively pointless as a trader. It is only relevant to understand what actions the Fed might take.\n\n\nUnemployment\nUnemployment is just a measure of the number of people unemployed. Recessions occur when the rate gets too high and everyone loses their jobs. The Fed would like to avoid that.\n\nIf it gets out of control, the Fed will likely take action and stimulate the economy, which will benefit our markets. \n\nRegarding macro news, focus on the big picture, don’t worry too much about timing, and remember that the market’s reaction is much more important than the specific number.\n\nIf the chart is bullish, even with weak macro data, we follow it. However, a major shift in the Fed’s policy can be an early signal that things could change significantly.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nhttps://www.jw.com/news/insights-energy-policy-executive-orders/\n\nhttps://www.woodmac.com/blogs/energy-pulse/president-trumps-orders-on-energy/\n\nhttps://eelp.law.harvard.edu/trumps-environmental-and-energy-executive-orders-initial-insights-and-what-were-watching/\n\nhttps://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/research-in-focus-trump-sets-clear-tone-on-energy-policy/\n\nhttps://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/alerts/2025/1/trumps-first-day-executive-orders-a-mixed-bag-for-energy-sectors/\n\nDisclaimer  \n\nWizard of Soho LLC and Weekly Wizdom publish financial information based on research and opinion.

Last week's main data release was Non-Farm payrolls, which was a miss compared to expectations; however, the unemployment rate came out slightly better. We have US inflation data today, with core inflation expected at 3.1% YoY and inflation unchanged from last month at 2.9% YoY. Additionally, Powell is also speaking today, and next Wednesday, we have FOMC minutes - these will be crucial for rate cut expectations, which have dropped to just one cut for the rest of the year.\n\nThis week, our technical analysis focuses on the following crypto tickers: TAOBTC, AR, JTO, HYPE, SOL, and LINK. For equities, we offer trade ideas for Gold and MP. Read on to learn all about understanding the Fed. Follow our analysts' ideas carefully, take note of the suggested levels, and stick to the plan! Enjoy, and happy trading!\n\nAFRM (Donny): Fresh off a big win in OKLO the week before, we nailed our AFRM entry in the week leading up to its Q4 earnings release. Gained entry at $57 with the stock now at $78 (36% unlevered return in 2 weeks, including 21% on earnings release date).\n\nTAO (Crypto Fox): Telegram limit long bid at 393$ hit 437$ for an 11.22% unleveraged move to the upside - 4.2R (sl being 382.5$)\n\nAFRM (Donny): Fresh off a big win in OKLO the week before, we nailed our AFRM entry in the week leading up to its Q4 earnings release.

If you haven’t read it yet, we recommend reading it HERE.\n\nIn this episode, we’ll review how the Fed works and how macro events tie into the market.\n\nUnderstanding The Fed\n\nThe Fed or Federal Reserve is the U.S. Central Bank. Their job is to “manage” the economy.\n\nThe FED works with what they call a ‘Dual Mandate.’ They want to keep inflation “low” around 2% while at the same time maintaining unemployment low (i.e., everyone has a job).\n\nThey achieve this through a few primary tools. Let’s discuss those tools and how they affect our lovely asset markets.\n\nFed Funds Rate\nThe Fed sets the interest rate on bank loans. While the entire system is highly convoluted, the effect can simply be described as making money expensive by raising rates or cheap by lowering them.\n\n\nWhen interest rates are low, money flows easily, stimulating economic activity. During periods of low rates, many companies borrow and push for growth. This boosts profits, helps companies expand, and, most notably for the Fed, results in hiring.\n\nIn other words, lower unemployment means more people with jobs.

The announcement of US tariffs on Canada/Mexico/China sent risk assets lower up until a pause was announced for most of them. Crypto, especially altcoins, had an extended overreaction that kicked off during the weekend before paring back some losses. Looking ahead, we have Non-Farm payrolls on Friday and US Inflation data next Wednesday in terms of data - with tariff talks remaining the main thing to keep an eye out for. \n\nThis week, our technical analysts provide trading plans on the following crypto tickers: ETHBTC, SUI, XRP, BTC, HYPE, and FARTCOIN. On the equities front, we discuss OKLO, NXE/DNN, MAC, and AFRM. Read the plans carefully, note the suggested interest levels, set your alerts, and wait for them to play out. In addition, our esteemed analyst, Pigeon, has started a new column, teaching you how to intelligently approach the market. On the menu this week: Global Liquidity. ... Enjoy!\n\nWLD (Crypto Fox): Our short hit entry at 1.8394 and ran down to 0.9636 for a 47.61% unleveraged move to the downside.\n\nOKLO (Donny): Bought the dip at ~$32, with the stock down 25% following Deepseek news. Stock last closed at ~$47 (~50% unlevered return in a week).\n\nWelcome to our new segment. In this section, I, Pidgeon, Master of Coin and Trader Extraordinaire, will share everything from understanding how the financial system works and impacts our coins to ways to optimize your money in crypto and other topics relating to making, managing, and keeping your money.\n\nIn this first episode, we’ll discuss ‘Global Liquidity,’ the most important macro factor in markets.\n\nWhat is Global Liquidity?\n\nGlobal Liquidity is a concept coined by Michael Howell.\n\nWe can create a ‘global liquidity’ model by tracking the money flow from central and commercial Banks, Private institutions, global capital flows, and general market liquidity conditions.\n\nIt is simply a measure of how much money is in the global financial system.\n\nThe most important players in this equation tend to be the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) and the People’s Bank of China.\n\nIn the next episode, we’ll explore the FED’s activities in more depth and examine how they affect global liquidity.\n\nThe Effects of Global Liquidity\n\nThe idea is simple: When global liquidity increases, asset prices do, too. Similarly, when global liquidity decreases, asset prices do, too.\n\nA great example of this could be seen in the previous cycle. The world economy was grinding to a halt off the back of the pandemic, as a result every major economy started pumping money into the system to stimulate their economy, pumping up global liquidity.\n\nWhat followed was the 2021 bull run, which pumped up every asset and coin under the sun. Then, come November 2021, the FED said “enough” and started Quantitative Tightening, effectively removing piles of money from the system and lowering global liquidity.\n\nThat change in the FED’s policy marked the exact top for Crypto. We then saw a massive bear market in assets as liquidity conditions tightened as countries started to fight inflation.\n\nThen something changed in early 2023. The FED and the US Government started bailing out failed banks, effectively pumping liquidity back into the system. This marked the start of our current bull run.\n\nGlobal liquidity tends to move in cycles, aligning pretty well with Bitcoin’s halving cycle. So, Bitcoin’s cut in supply emissions comes just as the world economy is being stimulated again.\n\nThis cycle has been under quite mediocre global liquidity conditions.

The announcement of US tariffs on Canada/Mexico/China sent risk assets lower up until a pause was announced for most of them. Crypto, especially altcoins, had an extended overreaction that kicked off during the weekend before paring back some losses. Looking ahead, we have Non-Farm payrolls on Friday and US Inflation data next Wednesday in terms of data - with tariff talks remaining the main thing to keep an eye out for. \n\nThis week, our technical analysts provide trading plans on the following crypto tickers: ETHBTC, SUI, XRP, BTC, HYPE, and FARTCOIN. On the equities front, we discuss OKLO, NXE/DNN, MAC, and AFRM. Read the plans carefully, note the suggested interest levels, set your alerts, and wait for them to play out.

Stock last closed at ~$47 (~50% unlevered return in a week).\n\nWelcome to our new segment. In this section, I, Pidgeon, Master of Coin and Trader Extraordinaire, will share everything from understanding how the financial system works and impacts our coins to ways to optimize your money in crypto and other topics relating to making, managing, and keeping your money.\n\nIn this first episode, we’ll discuss ‘Global Liquidity,’ the most important macro factor in markets.\n\nWhat is Global Liquidity?\n\nGlobal Liquidity is a concept coined by Michael Howell.\n\nWe can create a ‘global liquidity’ model by tracking the money flow from central and commercial Banks, Private institutions, global capital flows, and general market liquidity conditions.\n\nIt is simply a measure of how much money is in the global financial system.\n\nThe most important players in this equation tend to be the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) and the People’s Bank of China.\n\nIn the next episode, we’ll explore the FED’s activities in more depth and examine how they affect global liquidity.\n\nThe Effects of Global Liquidity\n\nThe idea is simple: When global liquidity increases, asset prices do, too. Similarly, when global liquidity decreases, asset prices do, too.\n\nA great example of this could be seen in the previous cycle. The world economy was grinding to a halt off the back of the pandemic, as a result every major economy started pumping money into the system to stimulate their economy, pumping up global liquidity.\n\nWhat followed was the 2021 bull run, which pumped up every asset and coin under the sun. Then, come November 2021, the FED said “enough” and started Quantitative Tightening, effectively removing piles of money from the system and lowering global liquidity.\n\nThat change in the FED’s policy marked the exact top for Crypto. We then saw a massive bear market in assets as liquidity conditions tightened as countries started to fight inflation.\n\nThen something changed in early 2023. The FED and the US Government started bailing out failed banks, effectively pumping liquidity back into the system. This marked the start of our current bull run.\n\nGlobal liquidity tends to move in cycles, aligning pretty well with Bitcoin’s halving cycle. So, Bitcoin’s cut in supply emissions comes just as the world economy is being stimulated again.\n\nThis cycle has been under quite mediocre global liquidity conditions. However, introducing the BTC Spot ETF has brought tremendous capital into the ecosystem that couldn’t be accessed before, which is a proxy for liquidity.\n\nHow to use Global Liquidity\n\nLooking at global liquidity trends can help us better prepare for macro moves.

The announcement of US tariffs on Canada/Mexico/China sent risk assets lower up until a pause was announced for most of them. Crypto, especially altcoins, had an extended overreaction that kicked off during the weekend before paring back some losses. Looking ahead, we have Non-Farm payrolls on Friday and US Inflation data next Wednesday in terms of data - with tariff talks remaining the main thing to keep an eye out for. \n\nThis week, our technical analysts provide trading plans on the following crypto tickers: ETHBTC, SUI, XRP, BTC, HYPE, and FARTCOIN. On the equities front, we discuss OKLO, NXE/DNN, MAC, and AFRM. Read the plans carefully, note the suggested interest levels, set your alerts, and wait for them to play out. In addition, our esteemed analyst, Pigeon, has started a new column, teaching you how to intelligently approach the market. On the menu this week: Global Liquidity. ... Enjoy!\n\nWLD (Crypto Fox): Our short hit entry at 1.8394 and ran down to 0.9636 for a 47.61% unleveraged move to the downside.\n\nOKLO (Donny): Bought the dip at ~$32, with the stock down 25% following Deepseek news. Stock last closed at ~$47 (~50% unlevered return in a week).\n\nWelcome to our new segment. In this section, I, Pidgeon, Master of Coin and Trader Extraordinaire, will share everything from understanding how the financial system works and impacts our coins to ways to optimize your money in crypto and other topics relating to making, managing, and keeping your money.\n\nIn this first episode, we’ll discuss ‘Global Liquidity,’ the most important macro factor in markets.\n\nWhat is Global Liquidity?\n\nGlobal Liquidity is a concept coined by Michael Howell.\n\nWe can create a ‘global liquidity’ model by tracking the money flow from central and commercial Banks, Private institutions, global capital flows, and general market liquidity conditions.\n\nIt is simply a measure of how much money is in the global financial system.\n\nThe most important players in this equation tend to be the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) and the People’s Bank of China.\n\nIn the next episode, we’ll explore the FED’s activities in more depth and examine how they affect global liquidity.\n\nThe Effects of Global Liquidity\n\nThe idea is simple: When global liquidity increases, asset prices do, too. Similarly, when global liquidity decreases, asset prices do, too.\n\nA great example of this could be seen in the previous cycle. The world economy was grinding to a halt off the back of the pandemic, as a result every major economy started pumping money into the system to stimulate their economy, pumping up global liquidity.\n\nWhat followed was the 2021 bull run, which pumped up every asset and coin under the sun. Then, come November 2021, the FED said “enough” and started Quantitative Tightening, effectively removing piles of money from the system and lowering global liquidity.\n\nThat change in the FED’s policy marked the exact top for Crypto. We then saw a massive bear market in assets as liquidity conditions tightened as countries started to fight inflation.\n\nThen something changed in early 2023. The FED and the US Government started bailing out failed banks, effectively pumping liquidity back into the system. This marked the start of our current bull run.\n\nGlobal liquidity tends to move in cycles, aligning pretty well with Bitcoin’s halving cycle. So, Bitcoin’s cut in supply emissions comes just as the world economy is being stimulated again.\n\nThis cycle has been under quite mediocre global liquidity conditions. However, introducing the BTC Spot ETF has brought tremendous capital into the ecosystem that couldn’t be accessed before, which is a proxy for liquidity.\n\nHow to use Global Liquidity\n\nLooking at global liquidity trends can help us better prepare for macro moves. Currently, the FED funds rate is being cut, which is a major support for global liquidity.\n\nThe Fed will likely need to resume quantitative easing (QE) in the coming years to avoid further economic hardship.\n\nQE is where they stimulate the economy through various means, such as purchasing assets like bonds and increasing economic activity. This will inevitably increase global liquidity conditions, which will pump our precious coins.\n\nWhen you hear ‘Quantitative Easing,’ just think about a money printer going ‘Brrrrrrrr.’\n\nThis can also help you determine whether a piece of news is actually relevant or just noise.\n\nRelevant news might read: “BTC Spot ETF Approved.” This approval allows billions of new dollars to enter the cryptosystem, increasing liquidity and prices.\n\nIrrelevant news might include the following: “Germany selling its seized Bitcoin.” While this creates short-term selling pressure, it does not greatly affect liquidity. The system takes over again when they run out of coins to sell.\n\nI hope this has helped you understand one of the factors behind asset market performance. Now that you know what is fueling the market, you can better formulate your thesis and avoid being scared by irrelevant news.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nhttps://www.jw.com/news/insights-energy-policy-executive-orders/\n\nhttps://www.woodmac.com/blogs/energy-pulse/president-trumps-orders-on-energy/\n\nhttps://eelp.law.harvard.edu/trumps-environmental-and-energy-executive-orders-initial-insights-and-what-were-watching/\n\nhttps://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/research-in-focus-trump-sets-clear-tone-on-energy-policy/\n\nhttps://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/alerts/2025/1/trumps-first-day-executive-orders-a-mixed-bag-for-energy-sectors/\n\nDisclaimer  \n\nWizard of Soho LLC and Weekly Wizdom publish financial information based on research and opinion.

In this section, I, Pidgeon, Master of Coin and Trader Extraordinaire, will share everything from understanding how the financial system works and impacts our coins to ways to optimize your money in crypto and other topics relating to making, managing, and keeping your money.\n\nIn this first episode, we’ll discuss ‘Global Liquidity,’ the most important macro factor in markets.\n\nWhat is Global Liquidity?\n\nGlobal Liquidity is a concept coined by Michael Howell.\n\nWe can create a ‘global liquidity’ model by tracking the money flow from central and commercial Banks, Private institutions, global capital flows, and general market liquidity conditions.\n\nIt is simply a measure of how much money is in the global financial system.\n\nThe most important players in this equation tend to be the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) and the People’s Bank of China.\n\nIn the next episode, we’ll explore the FED’s activities in more depth and examine how they affect global liquidity.\n\nThe Effects of Global Liquidity\n\nThe idea is simple: When global liquidity increases, asset prices do, too. Similarly, when global liquidity decreases, asset prices do, too.\n\nA great example of this could be seen in the previous cycle. The world economy was grinding to a halt off the back of the pandemic, as a result every major economy started pumping money into the system to stimulate their economy, pumping up global liquidity.\n\nWhat followed was the 2021 bull run, which pumped up every asset and coin under the sun. Then, come November 2021, the FED said “enough” and started Quantitative Tightening, effectively removing piles of money from the system and lowering global liquidity.\n\nThat change in the FED’s policy marked the exact top for Crypto. We then saw a massive bear market in assets as liquidity conditions tightened as countries started to fight inflation.\n\nThen something changed in early 2023. The FED and the US Government started bailing out failed banks, effectively pumping liquidity back into the system. This marked the start of our current bull run.\n\nGlobal liquidity tends to move in cycles, aligning pretty well with Bitcoin’s halving cycle. So, Bitcoin’s cut in supply emissions comes just as the world economy is being stimulated again.\n\nThis cycle has been under quite mediocre global liquidity conditions. However, introducing the BTC Spot ETF has brought tremendous capital into the ecosystem that couldn’t be accessed before, which is a proxy for liquidity.\n\nHow to use Global Liquidity\n\nLooking at global liquidity trends can help us better prepare for macro moves. Currently, the FED funds rate is being cut, which is a major support for global liquidity.\n\nThe Fed will likely need to resume quantitative easing (QE) in the coming years to avoid further economic hardship.\n\nQE is where they stimulate the economy through various means, such as purchasing assets like bonds and increasing economic activity. This will inevitably increase global liquidity conditions, which will pump our precious coins.\n\nWhen you hear ‘Quantitative Easing,’ just think about a money printer going ‘Brrrrrrrr.’\n\nThis can also help you determine whether a piece of news is actually relevant or just noise.\n\nRelevant news might read: “BTC Spot ETF Approved.” This approval allows billions of new dollars to enter the cryptosystem, increasing liquidity and prices.\n\nIrrelevant news might include the following: “Germany selling its seized Bitcoin.” While this creates short-term selling pressure, it does not greatly affect liquidity. The system takes over again when they run out of coins to sell.\n\nI hope this has helped you understand one of the factors behind asset market performance. Now that you know what is fueling the market, you can better formulate your thesis and avoid being scared by irrelevant news.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nhttps://www.jw.com/news/insights-energy-policy-executive-orders/\n\nhttps://www.woodmac.com/blogs/energy-pulse/president-trumps-orders-on-energy/\n\nhttps://eelp.law.harvard.edu/trumps-environmental-and-energy-executive-orders-initial-insights-and-what-were-watching/\n\nhttps://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/research-in-focus-trump-sets-clear-tone-on-energy-policy/\n\nhttps://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/alerts/2025/1/trumps-first-day-executive-orders-a-mixed-bag-for-energy-sectors/\n\nDisclaimer  \n\nWizard of Soho LLC and Weekly Wizdom publish financial information based on research and opinion.

The announcement of US tariffs on Canada/Mexico/China sent risk assets lower up until a pause was announced for most of them. Crypto, especially altcoins, had an extended overreaction that kicked off during the weekend before paring back some losses.

Today, all eyes are on the FOMC, where interest rates are expected to remain stable. However, the market will look for forward guidance on rate cuts. Looking forward, we will have GDP prints from Europe and the US this week and PCE, spending, and job openings in the US next week.

We have FOMC minutes today, Non-Farm payrolls on Friday, and US Inflation data next Wednesday. \n\nThis week's Technical Analysis covers the following crypto tickers: SOL, JASMY, ENA/BTC, BTC, SUI, LINK, ENA/USDT, and XRP. We cover IPX, Uranium, SGML, DJT, and CVNA for equities. Please read the detailed trading plans carefully, set your price alerts, and wait to pull the trigger! Enjoy, and happy trading!\n\nIPX (Donny): Stock traded up to ~$39 in the 10 days following our NL call at $28, last traded at $34, and looks coiled to trade higher.\n\nSGML (Donny): Called back in November as a prime tax-loss-selling candidate into the end of the fiscal year. Accumulated between $13 and $11, the stock immediately traded up ~14% to begin 2025 once tax-lossing subsided.\n\nMarket Pullback (Pidgeon): In our Monday email, we informed everyone that the market would be pulling back, giving everyone time to adjust their positions accordingly.\n\nSOL (Pidgeon): Solana came down to fill our $175 bids over the holidays before getting a nice strong pump, smashing targets, and going up to $223.\n\nDisclaimer  \n\nWizard of Soho LLC and Weekly Wizdom publish financial information based on research and opinion.

There hasn’t been catalyst data; however, we have seen a lot of leverage and heavy positioning in crypto. We have US inflation data today, which is the main event for this week. Looking ahead, all attention will be on the FED’s rate decision next Wednesday (18th), with the market currently pricing another 25 bps cut. As always, a press conference and economic projections will reveal how the FED sees the US Economy and what that entails for future rate cuts.\n\nThis week, our Technical Analysts cover the following tickers: XMR, ALGO, SSV, BTC, INJ, SUPER, GOAT, CHILLGUY, and XRP. We cover SGML, LIF, OKLO, GOOGLE, and HON on the equities front. Please be careful and read the trading plans, commit to the specific price level ranges, and wait for the outlined opportunities! Enjoy, and happy reading!\n\nXMR (Crypto Fox): Last week’s NL long call hit entry at 196.48 and ran up to hit a local high at 228.02 for a 16.05% unleveraged move to the upside.\n\nXMR (Crypto Fox): Last week’s NL long call hit entry at 196.48 and ran up to hit a local high at 228.02 for a 16.05% unleveraged move to the upside.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n(n.d.).
