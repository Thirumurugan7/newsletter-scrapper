The smallest group represented was of agencies who have been in business for \n16+ years\n (18 agencies).\nAgency size and years in business of the top agencies, highlighting the majority in the \"boutique\" category and those that have been in business for 305 years.\nThis indicates that many of the creator agencies on the top agencies list are running relatively small teams and have been in business for less than 5 years.\n There is still a lot of green space for these agencies to grow—whether it means taking on new team members and/or managing more creators.\nMany creator agencies are running relatively small teams and have been in business for less than 5 years. But several have been in business for 16+ years, showing the potential for longevity.\nFurthermore, the fact that some agencies on the list have been in business for 16+ years (from before the explosion of influencer marketing on short form video platforms like TikTok and Instagram) shows the \npotential for longevity in this business\n.\nWhen we looked at the breakdown of creator content niches across these size buckets (boutique, midsize, and enterprise), we found that \nlifestyle and fashion were the top first and second content niches respectively across each size category.\nTop creator niches across each size category of talent agencies. Lifestyle and fashion were the top first and second content niches for each category.\nExplore the full Top Creator Agencies List of 2024\nLooking ahead, we believe the economic opportunities for creators are only going to continue to grow and creator managers will continue to play a big role in that. \nThe \nTop Creator Agencies List of 2024\n is a group that includes both young and hungry agencies and powerhouse, established agencies.\nWe expect to continue seeing creative work and innovative partnerships from all of them. \nWe also expect creator talent managers to becoming increasingly prevalent\n and important in the influencer marketing industry, \nand expect to see more traditional entertainment talent agencies beginning to manage content creators.\nWith many of the agencies identifying as \"boutique\" in size and in business for less than 5 years, there are many dimensions along which these agencies could grow. They may choose to hire bigger teams and/or take on more creator clients. They could diversify across content niches or double down on their specialties.\nOne way in which we expect to see agencies growing is by expanding the management services they offer to creators across multiple platforms. \nOne way in which we expect to see agencies growing is by expanding the management services they offer to creators \nacross multiple platforms\n. With many creators realizing the importance of long-form content and building a sustainable community, we are already seeing creators who started making content on Instagram and TikTok now building out monetizable channels on YouTube or in their own email newsletter. \nThese agencies could accelerate this by continuing to work within highly marketable consumer niches like lifestyle and fashion to \nbuild out more complex, multi-channel partnerships with top brands\n.\nThis type of expanded service would emphasize the value that creator managers can bring to their talent: \nhelping them build and manage more streams of income from new partner channels\n, without needing to sacrifice the time and effort that they want to spend on content.\nWhat are your thoughts on the future of the industry?

Or, bonus points: copy that makes a relevant offer (more on that below)."

    "full_text": "We went through all of this advice live, including real examples, in our Welcome Email Webinar with Bryan—watch the full video \nhere\n!\n‍\nWhen it comes to email marketing, the welcome email might be the most important first thing to get right.\nIf you have email marketing ambitions but you’re not sure how to start, start with your welcome email.\nIf the welcome email ends up being the only email blast you ever send, that alone is worth the effort.\nIt’s just that important.\nHere’s why: Your welcome email will be your most opened email ever, and by a lot. Studies show that welcome emails get anywhere from 100-400% higher opens and 500% higher clicks than the average newsletter email.  Email is already the best performing channel for “deep conversions”—which is a fancy way of saying you’re making a big ask, like to buy something or download something, etc.  So if you have a compelling offer or ask — like a discount code, a launch, or a link to your latest most important piece of content—put it in your welcome email!\nA welcome email alone is not good enough to get high engagement. It needs to be instant.\n A real-time welcome email gets an 88% open rate on average\n. Delaying the welcome email by just a few hours \ndrops that welcome email open rate to 53%\n. That’s a huge hit to take for not welcoming your new subscribes in real time.\nOf course it makes sense that the welcome email should get so much attention: that’s when intention is highest!  Google built an entire trillion dollar business on monetizing just-in-time intent. You can make it work in your favor, too.\n‍\n74% of new subscribers expect a real-time email.\n Say hi to your best fans and your most interested leads at the exact moment they most want you to. Don’t let the moment pass. That would be the equivalent of hiring a cashier who has a penchant for running away right when a customer wants to check out.\nIf you need one more reason to setup that welcome email, I saved the best for last:\nSubscribers who receive welcome emails exhibit 33% more long-term engagement than those who don’t.\nI’m a digital marketer, so trust me when I say that finding that kind of lift is like finding a four-leaf clover growing on a unicorn horn. You just don’t find simple conversion hacks like that anymore.\n‍\nConversely, if you’re not sending welcome emails, you’re dooming yourself to 25% less opens FOREVER.  Imagine that future you who’s toiling away at another awe-inspiring email blast. Don’t let future you’s masterpiece email go unopened because of a missing welcome email today. Future you is too smart, too industrious, and too good looking to deserve such a doomed fate.\nSo we are in agreement, welcome emails are crucial. Good. And yet…\nOver 88% of Beacons creators who collect emails do not send a real-time welcome email.  \nWe get it. Welcome emails are hard.  You need some arcane technical know-how and a lot of motivation to tackle the “cross-platform real-time automation” setup required of welcome emails. The platforms where you blast emails don’t play nice with the platforms where your fans are signing up, like Beacons. And if you hear “Zapier” one more time from one more know-it-all digital marketing geek… they better duck, amirite? You’re a creator, you have more important things to make!\nWell lucky for you, Beacons creator, we have a tool that lets you \nquickly and easily create free automated welcome emails\n! And if you’re already using another email marketing service, you can still export all your Beacons page signups there when you’re ready to do your next blast. But in the meantime, using Beacons’ free welcome email feature will ensure you don’t let the crucial first impression moment pass when you get a new subscriber. \nBelow we'll cover:\nPart 1: The Signup Form\nPart 2:The Welcome Email\nLet's get into it.\nWant 1:1 tips on setting up your welcome flow? \nSchedule a call\n to chat with an expert from our Email Marketing team!\nMaking a Beacons Welcome Email That Doesn’t Suck, Part 1: The Signup Form\nAn effective, highly-converting welcome flow actually starts with your signup form.  This is what it looks like in your Beacons creator account with default text:\n‍\nThe biggest mistake we see is that folks leave the default copy in there.\n  You really should tailor the copy to your audience and to yourself.\nWould you propose marriage to your significant other with default transactional copy? Of course not. Similarly, asking for an email is a big step up in the creator-fan relationship. If your best fans/leads are not reading words that are unmistakably you or your brand, you probably already lost them.\nHere’s some tips on writing good signup form prompts:\nBe human and/or be you\n“Stay up to date” sounds like a robot, because it is.  People don’t like giving their emails to robots. The main reason your best fans want to sign up for your newsletter is because it’s coming from you. So don’t be afraid to inject the copy with some personality, to use a little first person voice, throw in an inside joke, maybe a suggestive emoji. Or, bonus points: copy that makes a relevant offer (more on that below). \nJust don’t do default!  Here are some examples for inspiration:\nTitle: “Harry’s Newsletter”\n Description: “Every Monday I share: 3 short examples, 2 copywriting tips, 1 favourite tweet.

Rescue me from your spam folder as needed. Reply to it! Add me to your contacts. Let’s go!\nYou’re almost in the inner circle! Confirm your subscription. You should have an email from me in your inbox — if not, check your spam folder. While you’re at it, feel free to send me a reply, because I do read them!\nThat thing I promised, that thing you want. The download link should be in your inbox right about…. now!  Go find my email, especially if it needs rescuing from your spam folder. We’ll be in touch soon…\nMaking a Beacons Subscriber Flow That Doesn’t Suck, Part 2: The Welcome Email\nBy now you should know that any real-time welcome email at all is better than none. \nThe difference between zero welcome email vs. average welcome email is a lot greater than the difference between an average welcome email vs. a great one. \nSo the number one tip on how to set up a welcome email is: don’t overthink it, just get it done!\nHaving said that, for all you overthinking straight-A over-achievers, here’s a breakdown of a great real-life welcome email. It's from comedian \nAshley Gavin\n.\nGavin, by the way, is really good at email and SMS marketing. She consistently sells out her tours because of it, despite little love from comedy industry gatekeepers. If you are a creator, I \nsuggest following her\n just to peep game… and bonus, she’s really funny!\nWhat does she do that's so smart? If you'll indulge me, I'll break it down:\nSubject line: straightforward and personalized\n\"❤️ Thanks From AshGavs ❤️\"\n It's straightforward and to the point, but with a sprinkle of emoji customization.  You know within a split second that this is the welcome email you from someone you were expecting.\nFirst person voice\n‍\nAt its core, a welcome email is a transactional email. But it doesn’t have to be dry and impersonal. \nRight off the bat, the first line in Gavin’s email hits you over the head with the first person: “Hey! Look, it’s me!” She uses the word “you” a lot, which highlights that this one-to-one human interaction. The gratitude feels genuine. And lastly, it’s a little unhinged, a little surprising, and very thoughtful; especially the line about showing up to your work!\nThis is not default transactional copy. You can really feel she wrote this. It feels direct.\nThe “looking into your eyes” picture\nSeeing a human face literally sets off a veritable electromagnetic storm in the human brain. It’s evocative, it’s primordially social, and dare I say, beautiful.\nAnd if the subject line wasn’t obvious enough, its now stupidly obvious that this email is from someone you trust; even if you didn’t bother to read any words before, after, and around the face.\nWhat’s more, her eyes are looking directly at you. \nPsych Studies have shown\n that people unconsciously comply when being “watched” by a pair of eyes… even if it’s a picture of a pair of eyes and the real person being “watched” is actually alone. Which is convenient, because you’re about to ask for one more thing…\nInvitation to reply\nPay attention to this simple little CTA:\n“Please keep in touch (you can email me directly)…”\nThis is the welcome email chef’s kiss right here.  Though AshGavs drops the invitation for a reply casually—almost as an afterthought—I can guarantee it’s very intentional. Getting a subscriber to reply has numerous tactical advantages for the sender:\nThe reply alone signals to Gmail’s AI that AshGavs is an important contact\nA reply initiates a private 1-1 connection between subscriber and AshGavs.\nThis 1-1 connection has a few important implications of its own:\nFor the fan, the existence of this connection feels sacred and scarce, compared to the all-eyes-on-me interactions of social media.\nThe fan who had replied and established a 1-1 connection will see a blast arrive in their inbox “from:AshGavs”, and harbor a hint of possibility in their mind that that email is a direct 1-1 email from AshGavs. This kernel of subconscious possibility will almost certainly lead to a greater probability of an open.\nAshGavs now has one very good signal/filter of her best fans. A subscription list alone is one concentric circle of her best fans; but subscribers who reply are an even smaller circle of her best-of-the-best fans. Someone as savvy as AshGavs will find a productive use for this information. And so can you!\nLast words: Help your fans find more of your content\nTo my creators who have made it this far: I hope you find the above useful and that it moves you to setup a real-time welcome email.\nOften an email marketing service like Mailchimp stands isolated from where your fans actually are.  No one on the internet is just loitering around a Mailchimp landing page for fun.\nBut, by definition, the folks who land on your Beacons profile are literally trying to get more of you. That’s where you should have your email signup.\n And now you can fire off a welcome email to those subscribes in real-time, for free! No technical knowledge required!\nOnce you’re done with your setup, tag us on our social (@beacons.ai on \nInstagram\n and \nTikTok\n) and we’ll give you some feedback.\nWant 1:1 tips, advice, or just a personal tutorial on setting up your real-time welcome email flow? \nSchedule a call\n to chat with an expert from our Email Marketing team—seriously, that's what we're here for!",

    "full_text": "Tips for working with other creators on TikTok\nWant to have a greater reach on TikTok? Collaborating with another creator could give you access to a whole new audience you wouldn’t have connected with otherwise. It’s a good idea to work with an established creator on TikTok because they’ve likely developed a loyal audience that trusts them and engages with their content. \nWhen it’s appropriate for your brand, it’s wise to take advantage of newer platforms like TikTok that have increased exponentially in popularity these last couple of years. Keep reading for tips on choosing the right creator to partner with.\nThings to consider before you reach out\nIt’s important to choose the right person to collab with. That way you have a better chance of increasing your target audience while building a quality relationship with a creator who can help you (and vice versa). It’s tempting to dream of working with mega influencers, but smaller creators can often be a much better fit for your brand. \nHere are three tips to consider before reaching out to TikTok creators.\nKnow your audience\nThis applies to both demographics and content that does well on TikTok overall — as well as what works for your specific niche. Let’s look at TikTok as a whole first. In contrast to other social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok has more experimental content. It started with dance trends, but TikTok’s now home to businesses, musicians, and others who are establishing a niche online. The content that succeeds on TikTok is organic and authentic. Whatever your niche is, make sure you’re aware of the overarching principles that guide successful content on TikTok overall. \nTikTok demographics also come into play when developing ideas for your collab. Most users are part of Generation Z. They’re skeptical of traditional advertising, so be aware of this especially if you’re a brand looking to work with a creator. Tailor content so that it looks as engaging as the rest of TikTok and doesn’t stand out as something to avoid. \nNow that we’ve looked at TikTok overall, let’s talk about knowing \nyour \nspecific audience. This is more than facts about your followers’ ages and locations. It’s about knowing what kind of content and creators your audience favors and interacts with. When choosing a person to work with, consider whether they’ll appeal to your audience and whether you have something to offer theirs.\nHave a goal for the collaboration\nMake sure you know why you want to work with a creator before you reach out. Would their product complement your brand perfectly and give you both a larger audience? Do they have a trusted audience that would likely be interested in your content or products? Whatever goal you establish, there has to be something in it for you and for them or the collab probably won’t turn into a long-term partnership. \nFor your collab, think about whether you’re trying to promote brand awareness or increase sales. If you’re trying to get your brand or content to more people, consider an influencer with a big audience. However, if you’re trying to increase sales, you might have a better shot at reaching out to a smaller influencer or creator with a more engaged audience. This kind of audience is more likely to invest in you and your content if what you’re posting aligns with their interests and goals.\nChoose a partner carefully\nAnd finally, choose a partner for your collab carefully. As we mentioned before, an influencer with a big audience may not be the right fit for you. They might reach a lot of people, but it’s unlikely everyone in that group is aligned with your content. \nIf you have an influencer or creator in mind already, think about how their content ties into your own content or brand. Do their videos complement yours? Are they considered thought leaders or authorities in their niche? Even if someone is considered a “nano influencer” with fewer than 10k followers, they can still be a valuable person to collab with, especially since they often have closer relationships with their followers. Also, consider how active creators are on other platforms. Sometimes it’s beneficial to connect with someone who started on TikTok first rather than someone who’s famous on Instagram and then moved to TikTok. \nTake a look at your possible collab partner’s followers, too. Ideally, your target audience should be the majority of your potential partner’s followers. How engaged are the creator’s followers? The more engagement the better. Even if an influencer has high engagement rates for certain posts, a creator with more consistent engagement across multiple posts is typically better to collab with. You can rely on an audience that’s constantly engaged rather than an audience that’s only engaged with a certain portion of content.\nWays to collab with other video creators\nIf you have the perfect partner in mind, the next step is to brainstorm content you can create together. Here are six ideas for your next video!\n1. Create a series\nIf you want to maintain a long-term partnership with another creator, do a series for your collab. Maybe you can tie it in with current events or issues in your niche. For example, if you’re a clothing brand looking to partner with a TikTok creator, the creator could post your newest dresses, tuxes, and pantsuits leading up to and during prom season (which also appeals nicely to TikTok’s younger demographic).\nA series is a good way to track audience engagement. If your first post attracts attention and the following posts get comments and likes, your collab is spot-on for your audience. If it’s not, it’s a good time to pay attention to audience feedback. But don’t beat yourself up, and don’t be afraid to try something else.\n2. \nInvite them to do a live stream\nA live stream is a great way to introduce yourself and/or the person you’re creating with to a different audience. By connecting with your audience in real-time, you’ll build more trust with people who follow you already and virtually introduce yourself to your partner’s followers. There’s no shortcut to showing your own face to build trust. TikTokers can tell whether you’re being genuine about your product and content. Let them see your authenticity by opening up on a live stream or doing a demo of your product with your partner’s support. \nlive streams have a couple of limitations to be aware of: You need to be over 16, and you need to have 1,000+ followers. \nIf you’re over 18, you can earn gift points from people who are watching your live stream. These points convert into real funds after the stream, so both you and your partner can monetize your time and efforts (as long as you meet the criteria).\n3. Host a giveaway together\nGiveaways incentivize audience engagement while promoting your content and/or brands. They’re particularly useful to tie in with holidays, events, and other special occasions applicable to your niche. For example, if you’re a food TikToker who’s partnered with a kitchenware company, you might post Christmas-themed desserts and other recipes using the company’s kitchenware. Then you could encourage users to post videos of themselves following one of your recipes. The winner of your choice gets some of the kitchenware to use for future recipes. \nGiveaways use both your and your partner’s creativity to reach as much of your target audience as possible. They’re good ways to establish your partnership and make it more noticeable in your niche, driving more traffic to both your pages.\n4. \nGuest post on each other’s accounts\nIf your partner’s more knowledgeable about an aspect of your niche than you are, have them guest post on your account and vice versa. You build a presence on TikTok more organically this way. Rather than relying on traditional advertising methods that Gen Z dislikes, you’re demonstrating your knowledge and how your content benefits your audience. As you do more guest posts with your partner, you’ll build your network with other TikTokers and gain more connections that help you and your partner both become more visible.\n5. \nFilm a podcast episode\nPodcasts are one of the most popular options for entertainment and education today. Listeners decide when they want to tune in, making podcasts a convenient and accessible option for on-the-go users. \nWith your collab partner, you can film a podcast episode and post a preview on TikTok that gets your audience excited. The preview doesn’t have to be the podcast content itself either. TikTok users are drawn to fun, experimental, relatable content. Show your audience a movie-style teaser or a couple of bloopers to get them engaged. If you’re promoting a product, talk about how that product fits into your podcast topics. Fitness influencers could post TikToks of themselves using their co-creator’s new products. Then both creators discuss the importance of physical health and mental well-being in their new podcast episode.\n6. \nPromote on other channels\nOnce you’ve established a solid partnership, promote your new collab on other influencers’ and creators’ channels. Look for people in your niche with audiences who’d enjoy or benefit from your content, and reach out to them to see if they’d be willing to promote you. \nPromotion goes for other social media channels too. While you don’t need to overstretch yourself to be on every platform, promoting your content on a few other platforms can make other people aware of the quality content you’re producing.\nCreating a win-win partnership\nIf you’re ready to collaborate with a creator, brand, or influencer, reach out! You’ve gone through the work of making sure your target audiences match and that there’s something in it for both of you. These things are key to a win-win partnership, where each person’s audience gains something from interacting with you and your partner. \nAn authentic, collaborative relationship can be one of your biggest assets in growing your audience on TikTok.

    "full_text": "How to create an attractive landing page design\nWant to draw users in with your online presence? An aesthetically pleasing landing page is the right tool for expanding your audience and providing users with a strong CTA so they convert.\nThe importance of web design\nThe design of your landing page is just as important as the content on it. A landing page is a page a user arrives on after clicking a link in an email or ad. It could be your website’s home page, another page on your site, or a page created specifically for a certain event, sale, or product. \nLanding pages are found through keywords and high-ranking search results. They exist to convert users, so how you design them is critical to whether you’ll succeed in reaching new users.\nTips for designing your website\nHere, we’ll look at six tips for designing an attractive landing page, plus an example of a great landing page.\n1. Use your brand colors\nTo keep consistency across your social media platforms and your landing page, use your brand colors. If users recognize the colors from your social media or other online spaces, they’ll be more likely to trust your landing page. The colors can create a familiar, engaging space for users, which makes them more likely to convert. \nNow is also a good time to evaluate your brand’s colors and common associations with them. Check out CoSchedule’s \ncolor graphic\n that lists common positive and negative associations for colors. (These differ across cultures, so be mindful of that, especially with a large international audience.) We have a built-in response to certain colors, so it’s important to be aware of those associations and see whether they’re helping or hurting your content. For example, purple is often associated with royalty, ambition, and wealth. Many brands selling luxury products incorporate purple because their products make people feel like part of the elite upper class. \nLet’s look at our example landing page from fitnessblender.com, a workout site with hundreds of videos (paid and free) for people at all fitness levels. FitnessBlender has videos from physical therapists, personal trainers, yoga experts, and more to accommodate different training styles, fitness levels, and body capabilities.\nThe colors here are an aesthetically pleasing mix of blue that transitions to green. FitnessBlender starts with blue as they describe the workouts they offer to benefit body and mind. Blue is one of the most well-liked colors across the world, which speaks to FitnessBlender’s international audience. It’s also associated with dependability and mental peace, reassuring users they can trust FitnessBlender to deliver on promises of better health. \nThen, as the page transitions to pictures of the workout instructors, the color fades into turquoise. Incorporating green here reinforces positive associations with the brand’s color, such as balance, wellness, and peace — exactly what FitnessBlender provides with its workouts. \nBrand colors are too often overlooked as the powerful tools they are. Work them into your landing pages to reinforce positive associations and build consistency across your content. Let tried-and-true associations do the work for you instead of reinventing the wheel.\n2. Make sure fonts are easy to read\nIt’s tempting to use decorative or elaborate fonts, but easy-to-read fonts are the best options for your landing page. They keep things simple for users and don’t distract from your landing page’s main goal, which is to get users to follow your call to action or CTA. \nFitnessBlender uses a simple white font so the words stand out against the blue-green background. The headline is bolded so it catches users’ attention. The subhead is the same color and font (but unbolded) and elaborates on the promise made in the headline. Finally, the CTA button has white text, but the button itself is black so the words stand out even more. There’s nothing fancy about the text itself, but the accessible font conveys the message beautifully and makes the CTA hard to miss.\n3. Add related graphics and beautiful images\nPictures and graphics are the first thing users will be drawn to on your landing page. Our brains process images 60,000 times faster than words. If users will absorb more information faster from one picture than all your text, that picture should be excellent!\nLet your images take up space on your landing page. They should be high quality and reflect who you are or what you’re selling (the same goes for graphics). A cosplayer on Instagram wouldn’t want a photo of themself in a business suit on their landing page. Instead, one or two of their best cosplays would do a much better job at capturing users’ attention. Those images also multitask by immediately showing users’ the cosplayer’s skill and content. \nIf you’re selling something, your images should connect to your product. If you’re offering a service, your images should demonstrate how that service is relevant to the people visiting your landing page. For example, a creator sharing gardening hacks on TikTok could have a landing page with cute graphics of unruly gardens along with a headline that offers help fixing this problem. This allows the creator to demonstrate their relevance while enticing users to keep reading and follow their CTA (more on this later). \nKeep your images high quality so you make the best possible impression on users. This is probably the one area FitnessBlender could improve on. The pictures of the different trainers are noticeably different in quality. Still, they provide transparency for users and demonstrate that they value diversity because they themselves are diverse. Even though the quality isn’t the best, the images still do a good job of emphasizing how accessible FitnessBlender is for everyone.\n4. Have a clear call to action\nDon’t let anyone click away from your landing page because they don’t know what to do or where to go next. Even if users are interested in you and your content/products, if you don’t direct them to a clear next step, they’re less likely to stick around. \nA good way to emphasize your CTA is to have clear, powerful, and engaging headlines and subheadlines. While these aren’t your actual CTA, they’re important for getting your audience interested so they’re more likely to follow the CTA itself. \nLet’s look at a few tips for good headlines. They should: \nGet the reader’s attention,\nTell them what you and your content are about, and\nBe short (preferably 10 words and never more than 20). \nHeadlines make it clear who you are and what you’re offering, whether that’s content, products, or something else. If you want to advertise yourself or your brand on your landing page, consider a headline that summarizes your brand rather than specific content, a product, or an event. \nAnd what about subheads? If a headline’s the hook that gets users intrigued, a subhead is a reel that draws them in and pushes them to convert. Both elements are critical in guiding your user towards that CTA. Subheads should elaborate more on your headline so users know what you’re offering and what problems you can solve with your content or products.  \nBy the time users reach your CTA, you want them to have a good idea of what they’ll be missing out on if they don’t follow the CTA \nand \nwhat they’ll gain from following the CTA. As humans, we naturally seek out ways to avoid pain. If you set up a problem on your landing page that’s solved by you and your content or products, you’ve given users the perfect solution. If you tap into the emotional fulfillment behind your brand, you’re appealing to what users will gain. Even products and brands that don’t seem emotional can do this! \nFitnessBlender uses excellent headlines and subheads to push users toward their CTA. They have a short headline “Feel Great. Body and Mind.” to emphasize their holistic approach to fitness. The subhead gives users all the things they’ll gain from using FitnessBlender’s videos that culminate with better physical and mental health. Conversely, users understand that they’ll be missing out on these benefits if they don’t join FitnessBlender, which is why putting the CTA button right under the subhead is perfect. \nYour CTA is the most important part of your landing page. It allows users to connect with you — starting a relationship you can build on in the future.\n5. Keep your page clean and organized\nLess is more. \nIt’s tempting to stuff your landing page with all your content, products, events, and merch, but if you give users too many options, they’re likely to not act at all. A strong CTA gives them one choice to make and an easy way for you to track whether your landing page is effective based on how many users follow that CTA.\nDon’t feel like you need to crowd your landing page with tons of images and graphics. If it feels overstuffed or confusing, users are more likely to click away. And your CTA won’t be as clear if it’s overwhelmed by too many images. The simpler your page is, the more user-friendly it is — and the more likely users will convert. \nUltimately, there’s no single formula for creating the perfect landing page, because so much of it depends on you, your content, and your audience.

    "full_text": "How to market your online shop and increase sales\nYour eCommerce shop can be one of the most valuable tools to gain new customers and increase sales. That’s why it’s key to spend a bit of time making sure your shop is as high quality, user-friendly, and engaging as possible. Well-written web pages and high-quality images and videos can direct customers back to you for years to come. \n10 tips for growing your eCommerce website\nUnfortunately, putting time and heart into your eCommerce website doesn’t guarantee sales. The “if you build it, they will come” mentality usually doesn’t work for creators, though it would be nice. That’s why it’s critical to build your website for the best user experience possible since customers are what drive your sales and what bring other people to your shop. \nHere are ten tips for growing your eCommerce website.\n1. \nBuild your email list\nEmail marketing has been around for a while, and it’s still here because it works. Make sure there’s an easy way to collect email addresses when customers are on your site. You could use a pop-up box that encourages users to type in their email for a discount or free shipping on their first product. Whatever technique you use, you want to collect as many emails as possible so you have a wide audience to reach out to with new content or products. \nYour emails are a chance to connect with new or existing customers, so be consistent and authentic with them. Every email is a chance to build more trust with a potential customer, so it’s important to be as user-friendly as possible. \nTry following some of these email design principles that draw readers in:\nUse a clear subject line so people know what you’re offering right from their inbox. \nUse an \ninverted pyramid design\n to guide readers toward action.  \nDesign content with people with visual impairments in mind (use color contrast, avoid flashy images, etc.).\nMake sure emails are mobile-friendly.\nUse images intentionally and sparingly. \nYou can use your emails to update users on promotions, new content, events, and other info that leads them back to your site. Every email is a chance to connect and be as personal as possible with your readers so they’re encouraged to visit your site.\n2. \nConsider paid Google ads\nGoogle Ads is Google’s equivalent to pay-per-click advertising. Businesses bid on keywords for the chance to advertise their site next to relevant web searches. Every time someone clicks on your ad, you pay Google, so this might not be an option if you’re just starting out. But for sites that are a bit more established, this could work well. Your brand gets exposure to customers who are looking for something in your area of expertise.\nYou can also tweak your ads anytime to reflect what you’d most like to communicate, like a new product, update, or seasonal promotion. Google Ads also reach thousands of websites in the Google Display Network. You can choose specific sites to run ads or let Google create a list for you based on the groups you want to reach.\n3. \nPrioritize SEO\nSEO (search engine optimization) involves being strategic about the words you use on your site so you can show up more often in relevant searches. It means putting yourself in your audience’s shoes and thinking about what terms they might type in to find your product. In your titles, descriptions, blog pages, and other content, you should be including these words to boost your chances of ranking higher in search engine results. But don’t feel like you need to overdo it. Balance including keywords with remembering the people you’re writing for. Your content should come across as natural and trustworthy rather than overstuffed with keywords just for SEO. \nRemember to be selective with your titles and meta descriptions. Meta descriptions are short summaries of each page. Along with the title of your page, these descriptions are the first things that show up in search results. They’re the perfect way to inform and bring customers to your site using just a few choice words. And don’t forget to include mobile users when you’re designing your site. The number of people who shop on their phones is increasing quickly, and you risk losing a huge portion of your audience if your site isn’t mobile-friendly. Making tweaks to organize your content can help keep your site friendly to mobile shoppers.\n4. \nCreate a blog\nA blog on your site informs, entertains, and guides your users back to your products. Worried you don’t have the expertise or skills to maintain a blog? Start with a roundup of expert opinions in your niche. Then post whatever they contribute to give your audience helpful and engaging content, making them more likely to return to you. \nYou can also guest post on other blogs to kickstart your audience online. Find a blogger in your niche whose audience would appreciate your product and what you have to share. Then offer to write a guest post that gives the audience quality info while pointing them back to your site.  \nYour blog can help you capitalize on events, issues, and FAQs in your niche. Release articles that speak to what your audience is interested in and problems or issues they might be looking to solve. For example, here on Beacons we have articles on how to monetize your social media accounts because we work with creators looking to grow their businesses on social media.\n5. Grow on social media\nYou don’t necessarily have to be present on every platform, but social media is an invaluable tool when it comes to growing your audience. Establish a consistent, authentic presence across your accounts to build trust with your audience. By posting high-quality photos and videos of your products, you can accomplish in one post or video what it might take many articles to do: get people to your site. \nEach platform is different, and it’s important to understand where you most need to be to get your potential audience to your site. Look at other influencers, creators, and brands in your niche to see where they’re most active, and remember to tailor your content to the specific platform. For example, Twitter posts do better with a single strategic hashtag, while Instagram posts thrive with more hashtags.\nAnd don’t forget to ask your followers what they’re interested in to generate content. See which of your products they are most curious about, and create posts based on that to engage your community and make them feel appreciated. Beacons offers a link in bio tool so users can easily get from your socials to your site. From there, use our powerful built-in visual analytics to help you better understand your audience. You can track your page views to see which ones are most popular and track your link clicks to see where people are going.\n6. \nCreate videos that could go viral\nThere is a good reason apps like Instagram that started with pictures now have ways for you to post videos. Videos speak possibly the loudest in visually oriented cultures. And with eCommerce, you can do a product demo that shows your audience right away how well your product works or how easy it is to use. \nYou can publish video content on your shop’s site and then promote it on social media. Don’t forget to include links back to your site when you post the videos. And if you can organically jump on something that’s trending, that could boost your presence online and send more people to your site. Just like with your email list, every video is a chance to inform and connect with your users. Keep being genuine and transparent about what you’re selling so you build that trust with your customer base.\n7. Offer a giveaway\nEvery brand or creator’s audience wants to feel appreciated by whoever they’re supporting or following. A giveaway is one of the best ways to incentivize your audience to support your brand. \nWhat’s appropriate for you? If you’re an author who’s about to publish a new book, offer readers a free advance copy if they share a link to your book a certain number of times. Or have your followers contribute character fanart, choose your favorites, and then send a free copy of the next book in the series to the winners. If your users are satisfied with what you’re offering, positive word-of-mouth feedback is much more likely to spread, both online and in person. Give select members of your audience a chance to test drive your product in exchange for comments and reviews on your content. Also, consider promoting giveaways to your email list to engage potential customers.\n8. \nPartner with other brands\nIs there another brand in your niche whose product complements yours? Partnering with other brands to increase your audience is mutually beneficial, as long as both your goals and values match. For example, if you’re selling cookbooks, you could partner with a brand selling kitchenware. You could co-host mini cooking segments on social media, with links to the recipes and kitchenware used. That way, traffic goes back to your and your partner’s sites while providing both of you with a whole new audience. Co-branded gift guides are perfect for holidays and special occasions. Another easy way to cross-promote is to discount one product with the purchase of another. \nIt could be worthwhile to reach out to influencers as well. Since they already have a strong presence in your niche and established trust with their audience, they can help promote your product more successfully to a wider group. If you’re in a focused part of your niche, look out for micro-influencers who might fit your brand better. Either way, influencers can help promote your product as part of their own lifestyle so it appeals to others who want to incorporate it into their lives.\n9. \nCreate an affiliate program\nAn affiliate program is another good way to boost sales on your site. How does it work? You reach out to people in your industry you’d want to promote your product, and they put an affiliate code on their page, bio, or social posts. That code sends people to your site, where they get a discount for using the affiliate’s code. The person you partner with gets a commission from the sale, so both of you benefit! \nUsing affiliate programs is a cost-effective way to broaden your reach and receive endorsements from trusted creators in your industry. Check out some of your favorite creators’ profiles to see how they’ve used this strategy.\n10. \nEncourage product reviews\nPositive feedback not only brings more people to your site, it also strengthens your reputation and builds trust among your audience. That’s why once you have a high-quality product, it’s important to encourage reviews so others can in turn be encouraged to purchase what you’re selling. You can highlight these reviews and positive feedback on your landing pages and product description pages to build social proof and drive conversions, like the example landing page below for Sticker Mule's \nphone case stickers\n.\nOffer incentives for people who leave feedback on your product, and advertise those incentives across your social media platforms.

    "full_text": "Tips for Writing The Perfect Pitch Email\nIf you’re looking for ways to monetize your content or reach out to your favorite influencer, try the cold pitch strategy. It can be scary and a little uncomfortable, but reaching out and getting a response is worth it! A well-written pitch email makes people aware of your high-quality product or content.\nWhat Is a Cold Pitch?\nA cold pitch is when you email someone, usually a potential client or customer, unprompted. You can use it for actively marketing a product or service (including yourself and your skills) to someone who hasn’t asked to work with you. \nCold pitches are useful no matter what field you’re in or social media platform you’re on. If you want to work with someone but they haven’t reached out to you first, cold pitches can help establish that connection.\nWhen to Use It\nThere are a variety of situations when it’s appropriate to send a cold pitch. \nAre you looking to: \nConnect with potential customers?\nIntroduce yourself to a person or company?\nHelp a brand work on a marketing campaign or something they want to improve?\nBuild a relationship based on commonality?\nFollow up with people who’ve expressed interest?\nIf your goal is to do one of these things or something similar, it might be the right time for you to use a cold pitch. It can feel awkward to reach out to people you haven’t met, but it can open you up to opportunities you wouldn’t get if you hadn’t taken that first step. This could be how you connect with that brand or influencer you’ve been eyeing! Above all, be yourself and be honest about your product or content. \nHere are some tips on how to write the perfect pitch email.\nHave an Interesting Subject Line\nInfluencers and other top names at companies receive hundreds of emails or messages a day. To make yourself stand out, you need a good subject line that’s short and catches people’s attention. Be creative, but don’t exaggerate about yourself, your skills, or your product. Focus on building a positive impression from the subject line alone. \nYour subject line should be about three to five words. Use words that will appeal to your recipient and get them to open that email. Are there trends, issues, or current events going on in your field? See if you can organically work that into your subject line to demonstrate your knowledge in your field.\nCreate a Human Connection\nIf you haven’t connected previously with the person or company you’re reaching out to, this can seem tricky. But using your words alone, you can still be friendly and thoughtful and establish the exact connection you want — one that will make the email recipient more likely to follow up. Whether you’ve met the person or not, show that you’ve done your research. Make sure you’re informed about their company and products as well as their stance on trends or issues in your area. Then you can tailor your email to explain how you’re able to benefit or connect with them in these areas. \nIf you’ve messaged or met the person before, it’s a good idea to refer to that initial connection. Remind them how you met at a conference or event or how you connected over something in one of their previous posts. By establishing this human connection, you’re putting your best foot forward and drawing the recipient of your email in. Don’t underestimate the value of being polite and intentional when it comes to sending that pitch.\nMake It Personal and Relevant\nInfluencers, company leads, and other people you’re looking to connect with are busy. By immediately making it clear how you or your product will benefit them, you’re more likely to earn their attention and a follow-up email. \nThis is where research comes in handy again. Let’s say you’ve seen a company talk multiple times about something they’d like to address. You happen to have the tools or connections to do that, and you decide to reach out. In your pitch, let them see how you’ve been keeping up with their interests and goals by mentioning that issue. Briefly talk about why you’re the ideal person for this over your competitors. Keep it focused on how people will benefit from connecting to you or your brand. By focusing on how you can benefit others, you make yourself more marketable to the recipient of your email.\nKeep It Brief But Interesting\nBoth appearance and content matter when you’re pitching someone. Keep your paragraphs short so they’re easily readable. Adding subtle color, graphics, or other interactive media helps draw your reader in, too. Are you pitching a product or design? Include links or pictures so people can see the quality of what you’re pitching for themselves. This builds trust with your customers since they can see you’re being transparent about what you’re pitching. \nPitch emails aren’t the place for the entire history of whatever you’re pitching. Mention the most important points and how those apply to your customer. Let your product’s relevance speak for itself by explaining what problems it solves. Including data, customer testimonials, or other reviews that back up your claims strengthens your credibility and makes your reader more interested.\nHave a Call to Action\nNo pitch email is complete without a call to action. Just like any social media post, people want to know what to do if they’re interested in connecting with you. Close your pitch with a request for a call or meeting, or end with a link to your product, website, or another relevant page. End on a note that leaves a positive impression. Make it easy for them to connect so they don’t lose interest because the next steps aren’t clear.\nFollow Up\nDidn’t get a response to your pitch? Don’t be afraid to follow up! Write a short paragraph about how you contacted them recently and think you’d be a great fit for them. Politely ask if it would be possible to talk more about what you’re pitching. Even without a response, following up is an acceptable and expected step to take. \nIf you did get a response to your pitch, capitalize on that. Reassure the person you’re the right fit for their needs and offer to answer any questions they might have. Keep that human connection going, and let the quality of your products speak for itself.\nCold Pitch Examples\nReady to write your cold pitch? Take a look at the examples below. \nA BookTuber named Hannah follows a literary agent on Instagram who wants to work with influential YouTubers. Hannah’s developing a product based on her videos and decides to connect with the agent. \nHi [Agent Name],\nI noticed you’re interested in collaborating with BookTubers, and I would love to connect with you. I have [X] subscribers and many videos on [topics that fit with the agent’s interests or preferences]. Currently, I’m working on [Project Name] that fits with your interests and is exactly what you’re looking for. \nMy [Project Name] would provide you with a whole new audience on YouTube. In it, I cover:\n[several bullets on topics of interest to the agent] \n[keep them concise and relevant]\nI’d love to provide a sample chapter if you’re interested. I’ve included my link in bio below so you can easily access my YouTube content and other social media. \nBest, \nHannah \n‍\nA cosplayer named Leo meets a fashion influencer at a festival and decides to reach out afterward. He wants to see if the influencer could promote him and his work since they have similar interests. \nHi [Influencer Name],\nIt was great to meet you at [X Festival]! I really enjoyed talking with you about [something relevant to what they discussed]. You mentioned that you’d like to work with other creators, especially on [your upcoming project], and I think I’d be the perfect fit. \nAs a cosplayer, I’ve worked on [relevant projects] and developed my skills in [relevant areas]. I’ve worked with [names the influencer would recognize and appreciate] on multiple occasions to great success.

I’ve included a link\tbelow to my portfolio so you can see examples of my past work. Please email me at [email address] if you’d like to talk about this more. \nBest,\nLeo\nFollow-Up Emails\nWhat about follow-up emails? Whether you’ve gotten a response or not, following up is just as important as sending that initial pitch. \nA TikTok fitness star named Bridget emails a company she wants to get in touch with about the resistance bands she is developing. She didn’t get a response so she follows up later. \nHi [Representative Name], \nI recently emailed you about [Product Name], my new resistance bands that appeal to Pilates fans everywhere. Because of your focus on effective but low-impact exercise, I think my product would be a great fit for your business. \nIf possible, can you put me in touch with [title or name for person she needs to reach at the company]? I would love to discuss this more. \nThank you!\nBridget\n \nThis time, Bridget gets a response back to her original email and follows up to keep the connection going. \nHi [Representative Name], \nThank you so much for your interest in my new resistance bands. I’ve already received positive feedback from customers and know this product would be a perfect fit for your brand. I’ve included a link below so you can see a few of our rave reviews! \nDo you have any additional questions?

Likewise, if you create a video featuring trendy ways to wear popular clothing items, use #fashion. If your video features a popular TikTok challenge, include #tiktokchallenge in your video description. This simple and easy step will do wonders to ensure your video stands out from the crowd."

    "full_text": "How to Make a TikTok Video Go Viral\nIf you think you can’t go viral on TikTok just because you don’t have a ton of followers, think again! Anyone’s videos can blow up on TikTok, but it doesn’t happen by accident. If you want to go viral, you’ll need to be intentional about creating content that resonates with millions of people worldwide. \nA Brief Overview\nGoing viral on TikTok means your videos are shared and liked by thousands of people (or more) on the platform. It also means people are sharing your videos on other platforms too, like Instagram, YouTube, or Facebook.\nGenerally, viral videos on TikTok get 1,000 to 2,000 views in less than an hour, regardless of whether they have a significant number of followers. If your video goes viral, TikTok will also feature it on the For You page, where it’s likely to gain even more traction among TikTokers.\nOnce you go viral on TikTok, you may also have access to opportunities you didn’t have before. For example, many people who go viral on TikTok go on to become brand ambassadors and influencers. So if earning money on TikTok is your goal, creating viral videos is a great way to get there.\nHow Does the Algorithm Work?\nMuch like Instagram and Facebook, TikTok’s algorithm works by recommending videos similar to the ones a user has previously engaged with. For instance, if you tend to like and comment on videos about animals, TikTok will show you more of them on your For You page feed.\nEvery video you create on TikTok has the potential to go viral. When you first publish it, TikTok will show it to a small, curated number of users. If it performs well among those users, TikTok may boost it so it’s shown to a much larger audience, where it could gain more likes and comments and go viral.\nHowever, one thing TikTok doesn’t take into account is a user’s follower count or prior engagement numbers. As a result, you’re just as likely to see videos from popular influencers as you are from brand-new users.\nObviously, not every video you create will go viral, but you can still create content that’s primed to go viral by following the tips listed below.\n1. Keep It Short\nNot surprisingly, short videos perform better than long ones on TikTok. If your video is too long, you run the risk of people getting bored or losing interest before they make it to the end. Remember, TikTok is a highly scrollable platform that encourages people to browse quickly and easily. So you want your videos to fit that vibe. Plus, people are much more likely to rewatch short videos that pique their interest.\nTikTok limits its users to creating videos that are either 15 seconds, 30 seconds, or 3 minutes long. Feel free to fill up the entire 3 minutes you’re allowed, but always make the most of your time spent on camera! TikTok’s time limits for videos almost force you to be more creative, so this actually works in your favor. Depending on your personal or professional brand, 15-second or 3-minute videos may work better. Don’t be afraid to experiment and find what works for you.\n2. Cross-Promote on Social Media\nTikTok’s popularity has blown up in recent years. And not surprisingly, social media users on all platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, and even YouTube, are now following the trend of creating short and snappy videos that resonate with other users. As a result, one of the best ways to increase your reach is to cross-promote your video content on other social media channels. Not only will this get your content in front of more social media users, but it will also improve your chances of going viral.\n3. Pay Attention to the Latest Trends\nTikTok is incredibly trend-driven, and although the trends only last for a few days, they are king for those days, driving the viewing habits of millions of users worldwide. If you want to get your content in front of more users, you’ll need to watch for the latest trends and hop on the bandwagon quickly before they lose traction. For example, there might be trending audio or a dance that everyone is doing. Take these trends and apply them to your own videos. Of course, you’ll want to add your own creative spin to them, but their familiarity will empower you to create relevant and timely content that resonates with more people.\nTo find current trends, just hop on your For You page and watch for things that are popular. Whether it’s a specific song, video text, or a general theme, take note of any repeating patterns and create your own content using them to enhance your chances of going viral. If you stay on top of the trends, you’re much more likely to gain the attention of TikTok users and score a viral video.\n4. Incorporate Hashtags\nHashtags are so important if you want your content to go viral. Including hashtags in your video description will help TikTok make sure that the video gets in front of the right viewers. For instance, if you create a video about how to make your own version of your favorite Starbucks drink, use a hashtag like #DIY to boost its performance. Likewise, if you create a video featuring trendy ways to wear popular clothing items, use #fashion. If your video features a popular TikTok challenge, include #tiktokchallenge in your video description. This simple and easy step will do wonders to ensure your video stands out from the crowd.\nNot sure which hashtags to use? Find trending hashtags using the Discover tab. Here, you can see which hashtags are used most often and what types of content creators are using them.\n5. Engage Your Viewers\nTo go viral on TikTok, it’s not enough to just post videos and leave them there. Instead, you’ll need to intentionally interact with your viewers by responding to comments on your videos, writing engaging video captions, and using the Duet and Stitch features to encourage other content creators to collaborate with you.\nThe more you interact with the community on TikTok, the more its algorithm will reward you for it. Ask your followers to share their opinions in the comments, encourage people to make their own response videos, and focus on creating content that others will want to share and interact with. You can even collaborate with other content creators and boost your profile that way. Start small at first by liking and commenting on their videos. Then, once you establish a relationship, ask about collaborating.\n6. Duet Popular Content\nBy leveraging TikTok’s Duet feature, you can create side-by-side videos that allow you to respond to other peoples’ content and increase your content engagement. When you create a Duet, the original video is placed on the right side of the screen and your video is on the left. Both videos play at the same time so you can follow along with the original video in yours. You can also enable the feature option on your content to encourage others to reply to your videos.\nYou can Duet popular content in several different ways to boost your video’s likes, views, and comments. For instance, you can record your reaction to a popular video, or you can show a before and after. Alternatively, you can even Duet your own video by showing viewers what it looked like behind the scenes from your perspective. These are all fantastic ways to use TikTok’s Duet feature.\n7. Use Trending Audio\nTrending audio can be a particular song, an audio clip from a movie or show, or just a mixture of sounds that have gained popularity among TikTokers. Using trending audio is a great way to garner attention from new followers because it’s familiar and engaging. Better yet, there are countless ways to put your own spin on a video featuring a trending audio clip.\nThe best way to discover trending audio on TikTok is to explore your For You feed and pay attention to any recurring audio you hear.

Just be sure to use that audio to create your own content right away, because trends change very quickly on TikTok, and before you know it, people will be sick of the trending audio you’re using!\n8. Add a CTA\nGoing viral on TikTok is an exciting achievement that can lead to plenty of great opportunities to grow your brand or business. But having one video go viral isn’t a guarantee that others will too. One of the best ways to keep viewers coming back to your page is to add strong calls to action, or CTAs, to your video descriptions that encourage them to check out your upcoming videos.\nDepending on the type of video content you create, adding an enticing CTA could be as simple as writing something like, “Follow me for more life-changing financial tips,” or “Follow me for more easy and effective workout routines.” Simple phrases like this will signal to your viewers that you’re a reliable source of useful information.\n9. Consistently Post\nTikTok’s algorithm favors users who bring lots of traffic to the site. That means the more content you create, the better off you’ll be! Although you don’t have to publish new content several times a day, it’s ideal if you want to grow your following quickly. In fact, social media experts recommend posting one to three times per day — or even more if you can manage it!

Whether you post once a day or three times a day, staying consistent is critical, because it ensures that your followers know what to expect from you.\n10.

    "full_text": "How to Make Your Instagram Reels Go Viral\nCreators dream of having their Reels go viral, and there are steps you can take toward accomplishing that. It takes hard work, planning, and effort, but by being yourself and making high-quality content, you’re already on the right track. \nA Quick Rundown\nInstagram used to be just for posting pictures, but now you can post Reels and stories, do livestreams, connect with brands, and much more. Reels are one of Instagram’s newer features. Inspired by TikTok, Reels are vertically formatted videos that are 15 to 60 seconds long. You can scroll through the Explore page or look at the Reels that pop up in your own feed. \nInstagram’s algorithms look at users’ interests and preferences and then suggest Reels to them based on that. There are many ways to tailor your content to both your current and potential audience and increase your followers. Going viral can bring more viewers to your page, which makes it easy for you to direct them to your other platforms, content, and merch. \nHere are ten tips to help you go viral and accomplish your goals!\n1. Share Them to Your Feed\nWhen posting your Reels, don’t forget to click the option that says “also share to feed.” This is an easy way to get your Reels onto both the Reels feed and your own feed. That way, you’re boosting your content to your audience along with making it easier for people scrolling through Reels to find. \nThe more visibility you have, the better the chance you have of getting more shares, likes, and comments, which can boost the placement of your Reel on Instagram’s Explore page. Combine that with using the right hashtags, and you have an even better shot at getting noticed. Because fewer people are posting and sharing Reels compared to regular Instagram posts, you have more space to top the charts in this feature. The more your followers like and share your Reel, the higher placement it could get in the Reels feed, boosting your chances of going viral even further.\n2. Grab Viewers’ Attention From the Beginning\nAs a creator, you know how important it is to get viewers interested right from the start. No matter what kind of post you’re creating, if you don’t get people invested immediately, they’re likely to go elsewhere for entertainment or information. Your followers’ time and attention are valuable, especially because they’re the people who can reach out to others and get you a bigger audience. So start your Reels off with a hook to grab viewers’ attention right away! \nHooks can be something surprising, exciting, or interesting. Do some research to see what’s trending and whether you can organically tie your Reel in with that. Either way, many Instagram users see hundreds of videos every day. For yours to stand out and go viral, it has to start with content that makes viewers’ time worth it. And it needs to have that surprising/exciting/interesting side so it’s worth sharing for the viewer. Instagram tracks the time people spend on your content, so the more people who watch your whole Reel, the better. Maybe you’re posting fitness Reels. Your hook could be something like “\nThis \nis how I worked out like [popular fitness name here].” Then give more information after you’ve already pulled your audience in.\n3. Use Trending Audio\nWhat better way to go viral than to tap into what’s already popular and put your own authentic spin on it? As a creator, you have limited time and energy, so it’s a good use of your time to research what’s popular. That way you’re aware of trends and can think about using them to bring your content to a new audience. \nLook for popular or trending songs or other audio that you can include in your Reels. Don’t force yourself to fit into every trend, but if you see one that’s perfect for your content, go for it! Plus, you can see what other influencers in your niche are doing for their Reels. Building off their content can help you establish a relationship while boosting your Reels’ popularity. And it inspires creativity and camaraderie between creators as you tweak the audio to reflect your content and have fun seeing what other people do with it too.\n4. Make Sure It’s High Quality\nThe good news is that you don’t need to be a professional photographer or video editor to make high-quality Reels. Smartphones have such good cameras that Reels can often be filmed with them. Be sure your Reels have good lighting and are high resolution. Ring lights soften the shadow and produce a better image for your Reel, so it might be worth investing in one if you’re shooting indoors.\nQuality also applies to the content itself. No one likes to have their time wasted, and unfortunately, that’s how low-quality content makes followers feel. Rather than trying to go viral with every new trend, focus on creating high-quality content that \ncould \ncoincide with the most popular hashtag or audio piece. Your followers will be able to tell if you’re making content simply to gain popularity, and you run the risk of losing their trust and then having a smaller base to build your audience on. It’s just not worth it to churn out cheap quality Reels for the potential views.\n5. Include Captions\nClosed captions make your Reels accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Also, many Instagram viewers scroll with the sound off, so putting text in your videos is a way to have them pause and watch your whole Reel. If your Reel pops up in their feed but they aren’t watching with sound, chances are they won’t stay engaged without some form of text or captions. \nTo really draw in your audience, be mindful of where you place text in the video. When people see your Reels in their feed, they’ll only see 4:5 size of the 9:16 full-screen Reels format. If you have text outside that safe middle zone of your video, people won’t see it unless they go full screen. Keep your Reels as viewer-friendly as possible by putting text in that safe zone. That way, people scrolling through Reels can get excited about your content and follow what you’re saying even without sound. This makes them much more likely to watch your whole Reel, giving you a better chance of going viral.\n6. Keep It Interactive and Engaging\nThe more users feel like they can interact with your content, the more likely they are to do so. There are many ways to make your Reels interactive to the point of going viral. If you’re a fashion designer, post your newest design on your Reel and ask your audience which celebrity they could see wearing the outfit to a special event. The effort you put into making content user-friendly makes your followers feel appreciated and welcomed in your online space, meaning they’re more likely to stay longer and interact thoughtfully.\nAs more people leave comments on your Reels, Instagram algorithms will notice, and you’ll have a better chance of popping up in people’s feeds and being noticed on the Explore page because of your audience engagement. Although it takes more time to create posts that generate user engagement, it’s worth it.\n7. Use Hashtags\nHashtags are tools to get you noticed if they’re used correctly. Do some research on what’s trending in your field or niche and see which hashtags apply to your Reels. Or if it feels authentic, build your next Reel off a popular hashtag. Instagram users typically make fewer Reels than other posts, so there’s less competition overall to reach the top of the hashtags for Reels. If you can match the number of interactions a popular post is getting for a certain hashtag, you’ll have a good chance of reaching a high spot for that hashtag. \nDon’t forget about the smaller hashtags in your mission to go viral. By putting out top content for small hashtags, you’ll gain more exposure to a wider audience, who can help you by sharing your content. When you want to tackle a large hashtag, you’ve got a better base to build on.\n8. Have a Good Thumbnail Image\nHow often have you clicked on a YouTube video because of the eye-catching thumbnail or interesting title? The same principle applies to your Reels. You only have seconds to catch a user’s attention, so be sure you’re putting your best content forward to do so. Even though it takes a bit of extra time to create an appealing cover for your Reel, it can draw in many more people than the Reel might have without it. \nSites like Canva can help you create eye-catching graphics for your Reel cover. If you don’t have the time to do that, no worries; just focus on using a good screenshot of the first few seconds of your Reel. Be sure to add text so users have a good idea of what your video is about. There are places where your thumbnail won’t show up, but users scrolling through the Reels feed will be drawn to creators like you who’ve taken the time to catch their attention.\n9. Pay Attention to the Best Viewing Times\nIt’s really frustrating to have content you’ve worked hard on get fewer views and shares than you’d hoped. Take some time to analyze when your content gets the most interaction from your audience. Posting at the best viewing times gets you more views, likes, and comments, which boosts your chances of going viral. \nIf your brand or niche has an upcoming event where your potential audience is more likely to be online, consider timing your Reels to fit with that, or look at other influencers’ posting schedules to see how they’ve maximized viewing times for audience engagement.\n10. Focus on a Niche\nWhen you’re trying to go viral, it can be tempting to join every trend that comes along. You might think the more trends you’re part of, the better chance you have of being noticed. But this might end up disappointing your audience if the trends you’re posting aren’t related to the content you promised. And if you’re flooding people’s feeds with your posts, they might get frustrated, making them less likely to engage with you. \nStay true to yourself and what you’re interested in or knowledgeable about.

    "full_text": "Current TikTok Trends in 2022\nTikTok trends change quickly, and keeping up with them can seem like an impossible feat. Regardless, keeping up with the latest trends can help you grow your business or personal account, so it’s important to stay on top of it.\nHow to Leverage the Latest Trending TikToks for Your Account\nAlthough it’s ideal to be genuine and create your own unique content for your account, it’s also beneficial to hop on the bandwagon and join the current trends. Why? Because people are familiar with them! Certain types of videos, sounds, or music are instantly recognizable to TikTok users, and because of that, your content will automatically resonate with them. And as a result, you could end up with more money in your pocket.\nGetting started is the hardest part, but there are plenty of trends you can take part in no matter what type of personal account or business account you have on TikTok. First, look for trends that are based on current events — for example, the infamous Will Smith slap at the Oscars or halftime show blunders at the Super Bowl.\nYou can also browse the Discovery page to find out what’s currently trending, although these trends are typically already oversaturated and are likely to only last for a few days before people start getting tired of them. So you’ll have to be quick about creating your own content! If you spot any repetitive actions, video text, music, or other features as you browse, these could indicate an up-and-coming trend.\nSo, instead of dismissing the idea of using trending content to grow your brand or personal account, embrace it! Learn how to put your own spin on some of these top TikTok trends for 2022. Make them your own and connect with your audience in a fun and personable way. Leveraging these trends will help you blend into your followers’ feeds and capture their attention.\nStart Dancing!\nTikTok is well known for its talented dancers and creative dance moves, but you don’t have to be a pro to capture your followers’ attention with a dancing video. Hopping on this trend is as simple as learning the moves and adding your own flair to it. For example, if you own a cookie shop, dance while you indulge. Or if you’re a parent, invite your kids to do the dance with you. Better yet, wear something completely ridiculous to show off your moves. However you make the dance your own, just be sure to have fun and leave a lasting impression! That’s how you’ll keep followers coming back for more in the future.\nIf you’re not sure which dances are trending, scroll through TikTok by tapping Discover to see what other TikTokers are up to. Learning popular dances may be easier than you think, and there are often tutorials out there if you search for them.\nKeep It Funny and Lighthearted\nTikTok is geared toward the under-30 crowd, and they tend to love funny videos, especially edgy ones. Deadpan, self-deprecating humor is the way to go on TikTok, but don’t get so stressed out about nailing the humor that you forget to have fun. Your audience will like your videos more if they see that you’re having fun making them, so enjoy the process. Just remember to be yourself and keep it lighthearted. The more authentic your funny videos are, the better!\nIf you’re not sure which topics to poke fun at in your videos, consider relatable struggles that everyone has, such as being motivated to get your life together, resisting the urge to eat fast food after spending $200 on groceries, finding normal people to date, or adjusting to parenthood.\nPractice Your Transitions\nWith TikTok’s video editing tool, you can easily switch from one video clip to another, opening up a variety of fun ways to recreate trending videos. This doesn’t have to be a complicated process, either. Sometimes it’s as easy as leaving your camera in the same spot and shooting two videos with the same lighting. Most trending transition videos also have tutorials, so you can easily learn how to do them yourself. And if you can create a seamless transition video that looks like magic, your followers will have a really hard time looking away! In fact, they’ll likely watch your video more than once, which is what you want.\nBe Open, Transparent, and Honest\nIt should be no surprise that most social media content is heavily edited. From unrealistic “makeup-free” pictures to catfish video filters that make users look like someone else entirely, it can be hard to find accounts that are genuine and real. If you feel this way, you’re not alone! All the editing and filters are getting old, and people are starting to seek out more real content instead, which means there’s a big opportunity for you to connect with followers on TikTok.\nWhether you have a business account or a personal account on TikTok, your followers will reward you for creating real content and being open and honest with them. Sometimes, getting vulnerable on TikTok might mean sharing a difficult journey or a challenging real-life story. However you choose to get vulnerable, be your authentic, real self, and others will take notice. Getting honest is a great way to create content that resonates with people, and it will also help your followers relate to you in a way that’s more personal and genuine.\nShow a Day in the Life\nAlthough your daily routine may seem like nothing special to you, you might be surprised to find how many people are curious to know more about it! Whether you’re a teacher, a blogger, or a stay-at-home parent, making day-in-the-life videos is a great way to invite your TikTok followers into your world and show them what you do every day. For example, consider sharing your morning routine or your method for cleaning your home, or give them a peek at what it looks like to make your company’s products. Whether you’re a professional, a student, a parent, or something else, there’s almost always a way to incorporate these types of videos into your content strategy on TikTok.\nDay-in-the-life videos are especially great if you tend to get a lot of questions in your comments. Not sure what to make a video of? Refer back to those questions and answer them! Your followers will be more engaged and are likely to continue asking you questions that you can answer with day-in-the-life videos.\nDon’t Take It Seriously\nYou don’t have to be a professional videographer to create great content on TikTok. It just needs to be relatable, trendy, and genuine to capture the attention of your followers. Of course, you’ll want to use a high-quality camera and good lighting to make your videos more engaging, but that’s really all you need to find success with TikTok videos. Other than that, just take the time to learn how to use all features provided through the video editing tool, and don’t be afraid to experiment with your content to find what works best for you.\nShow Off Your Glow Ups\nA glow up on TikTok is essentially a before and after video showcasing someone as a younger, less confident version of themselves followed by a stunning and confident photo or video of themselves now. These types of videos tend to generate a lot of positive feedback. They’re also great for getting viewers to stick around till the end of the video, because obviously, they want to see the final image! \nHowever, a glow up doesn’t have to feature your own personal transformation. Depending on your brand or business, this type of video could also feature other things, like a before and after of an art project, your family, a home renovation, a product you make, or the growth of your small business.\nHome in on a Niche or Subculture\nTikTok subcultures and niches cater to a certain group of users who are looking for a specific type of content. Subcultures range widely in topic, from gametok and gymtok to dadtok and more, providing endless possibilities for your content creation. \nTo find a niche, ask yourself what you’re into and what type of content you would enjoy creating. Obviously, you should also consider how it will impact your business or personal brand if your goal is to earn money through TikTok videos. From there, you can search for keywords like momtok or runningtok, or simply scroll through the app and like and comment on content that you enjoy. Doing so will ensure your For You page shows you the type of content you want to see and replicate with your own videos.\nEntertaining Educational Videos\nTikTok also has a surprising amount of educational content that’s great for all ages. For example, if you tap Discover at the bottom of your screen, you can search for educational videos with the hashtag #learnontiktok. You’re likely to find tons of videos of teachers offering fun mini lessons, animal experts teaching about various types of animals, cool how-to science experiment videos, and so much more.\nWhatever your career or passions, you can always find a way to create entertaining educational videos that TikTok users will enjoy and find useful.\nGrow With Beacons \nIf you want to grow your presence on TikTok and leverage current trends to do it, Beacons can help you succeed.

When you’re making quality, authentic content, it’s worth adapting and tweaking for multiple platforms. \nRepurposing also helps you target certain audiences using keywords and hashtags, which can give you an SEO boost and grow your audience. By adapting your content to different platforms, you’re automatically reaching out to more people than you would have by staying on one platform. As your influence grows, you’re more likely to become an authority in your field and connect with top creators. \nHere are eleven ways you can do just that.\n1. Convert Listicles Into Individual Blogs\nIf you have popular content with multiple parts, expand it to increase traffic on your platform. Let’s say you have a film blog with a list of the best animated shows to watch. You’ve gotten a ton of clicks on this article, so why not expand it to give each show its own article? This way, you’re using the framework of what you’ve already created to generate more interest in a topic you know people care about. Consider timing the release of these individual pieces with important dates, like when the next season of a show is coming out. Whatever topic you’re working with, it’s important to take audience interest and optimal timing into account. \nYou also have the opportunity to expand on things you touched on in the original listicle. This gives your readers an opportunity to learn more about the original content if they were previously engaged and already looking for more material. The opposite strategy works, too. Have a collection of articles you think would make a great post? Condense them and put all the links in one place so your audience knows where to go for more content.\n2. Make a YouTube Video\nYouTube is the ideal gateway for reaching new viewers. As a culture, we often prefer watching videos or other audio-based media over other means of communication. On many social media platforms, videos automatically start playing as you scroll past. The ones that grab your attention make it difficult to pull away. Videos can make your content more accessible for visually impaired followers, too. \nHow-to content is particularly good to adapt from a written piece to a video. Seeing a product or demonstration of your skill convinces viewers of your credibility. It might take a lot more words to get across the same message! For example, let’s say you’re an Instagram artist looking to post videos of your drawing process on YouTube. Try compiling some of your most popular art into a YouTube Short and use that as a base to attract followers. Then you can build on that exposure to explain how you created those pieces in longer videos (which your audience will now be more likely to watch).\n3. Create an Infographic \nLike videos, infographics speak to our visually minded culture. If you’re a fashion influencer looking to point out the pros and cons of certain brands, an infographic can break that down and make your information more accessible to any audience. \nViewers are much less likely to scroll past an infographic, even if they haven’t otherwise been engaged by the post yet. Using color and graphics strategically to catch their attention will make them pay more attention to the post itself. They’re also more likely to look at your other content if they find the infographic helpful, engaging, or relatable. Not a designer? Don’t worry. Tools like Canva, Piktochart, and Visually make it easy for anyone to make infographics, regardless of skill level.\n \n4. Write an Ebook \nCreating an ebook may seem overwhelming, but you’d be surprised at how many started off as compilations of high-quality blog posts or articles. Ebooks are a convenient way to compile the valuable information on your site in one place. They can attract new subscribers and create new revenue channels. They’re accessible no matter where you are and have helpful features like highlighting and note-taking that promote audience engagement. \nTake the time to make your ebook worth your audience’s investment. Add pictures, make the layout consistent and appealing, and give extra links or resources so your readers can investigate more on their own.\n5. Tweak Old Posts\nWe talked about this a bit already with expanding or compressing listicles, but there are so many other ways to repurpose old posts. Try doing some research into current affairs involving your topic. Is a new season coming out for a show you’ve done cosplay for? Is a thought leader in your field writing a book that relates to your video essays? Once you’ve searched for new updates, tweak your old content to tie it in. \nA good way to decide what posts to tweak is to evaluate whether they’re evergreen content. Evergreen content is applicable and relatable no matter what year it’s read in. For example, posts about how to strengthen your relationships will never go out of style! Simple tweaks like using more SEO-friendly headlines or posting at optimal times for your audience help attract viewers too.\n \n6. Make a Post on Quora\nYou’ve likely thought about posting on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, but what about Quora? This social answers site makes it easy for you to answer a question and demonstrate your expertise so readers head back to your blog or social media for more. \nOn Quora, you can post your content as replies to users’ questions. You can also have your own user blog where you post on relevant topics as you see fit. Either way, it’s a good opportunity to increase your online presence by interacting with the site’s audience. The opposite is also true. If you’ve posted on Quora and gotten a lot of interest, consider expanding what you did there into a series of articles or videos.\n7. Use Your Social Media\nUse your different platforms to grow your audience. If you have a YouTube video, put a snippet of it on your Instagram or TikTok to hook viewers into your channel. Beacons makes it super easy for your followers to find your other platforms. Our link in bio tool puts all your content in one place so your audience doesn’t have to look far to find more great material. \nTry reposting content from one platform to another. Repost old images or infographics to quickly catch your viewers’ attention, or try using a screenshot of a post from one platform against an aesthetic background on another platform. If you have content with quotes from thought leaders in your field, extract those quotes and post them on social media to bring attention back to your longer content.\n8. Guest Post on Other Websites\nIf you have enough expertise on a topic, consider guest posting on another website. This is a great way to get your content in front of an audience you might not reach otherwise. It also secures more backlinks to your content and gives you more of an established presence online.  \nUse your original post as the core. What can you expand on? If you have an article with multiple sections, take a new approach to each section so the content is original enough to be posted elsewhere but still reasonably leads back to your original post. Lend your expertise on fashion, baking, fitness, or another topic to other respected creators’ posts or videos. This demonstrates your character while pointing people toward your platforms for more high-quality content.\n9. Start Podcasting \nPodcasting makes your content accessible to a whole new spectrum of listeners. People might not have time or energy to read an article, but they’re far more likely to listen to podcasts while doing things like driving, cleaning, or working out. Podcasts let people choose when they want to tune in, and that convenience makes it likely they’ll come back for more if they’re hooked by the content itself. Podcasts also make your content more accessible to visually impaired individuals. \nKick off your podcasts with your original content, and expand on it by conducting interviews or discussing big events in your field. A podcast can also be repurposed into a blog post and vice versa.\n10. Transcribe Your Video Content \nHave an old video you’re dying to update? Transcribe your video into a blog post, article, or several social media posts. Not only does a transcript make your content more accessible to a wider audience, but it also creates greater consistency between your platforms. Beacons is the perfect tool to maintain that consistency. Our free website builder lets you put all your links in one place so your audience has a one-stop place to go for content, merch, and interaction. \nFor example, let’s say you’re reviewing the hottest fashion trends. Your videos get lots of views, but you’d love to pull in more social media influencers and grow your audience. Transcribe snippets of your videos and post them on social media, like Twitter or Instagram. Or take short snippets from your videos and make them the ideal length for TikTok. Either way, use what you have in video form to attract an audience from a different perspective, then lead them to your other platforms with your Beacons link in bio.\n11. Write Follow-Ups \nWhatever your niche, there are always opportunities to repurpose content by following up. Paying attention to local, national, and international happenings can give you the right inspiration and timing for posting follow-ups to your content. \nIf you have a popular post that’s been getting more attention recently, think about how you can make the most of that attention. What expert opinions can you draw from to add credibility to your posts? Don’t forget to ask your followers what they’d like to see more of. Posting some user-generated content is another great way to draw your audience in and get a better idea of what content is worth revisiting.\nGrow With Beacons \nIf you’re looking for a platform that supports you as a creator, join Beacons today!

    "full_text": "Ways to earn an income on TikTok\nTikTok has quickly become one of the most popular social media platforms in the world. This popularity also means there are income opportunities for influencers and creators. If you’ve been thinking of trying to earn an income on TikTok, there are some things you need to know.\nIn this guide, we’ll give you some tips for starting your income stream on TikTok and how to maximize the money you bring in.\nCan you\n \nearn extra cash\n \non social media?\nYou definitely can earn money on social media, but it does take more hard work than many people assume. It’s more than just posting pictures or videos of trending dances. You need to make an effort to set yourself apart in a saturated market, you need to create good content that can stand up with the quality of top creators, and you need to produce content often. It can be a full-time job! But it gives you a lot of freedom and allows you to be creative, so if you can make money doing something you love, why not give it a try?\n6 ways to make money on TikTok\nIf you’re looking to make money on social media, it’s best to diversify your income streams on every platform. There are multiple ways to make money on TikTok, so if you want to increase your opportunities, you should use two or more of these methods. \nWith that in mind, here are some of the best ways to make money on TikTok.\n1. Partner with brands\nPartnering with brands is one of the most common ways a TikTok creator can make money. This is known as sponsored content, and it involves you marketing a product or service for a brand on your TikTok account. You and the brand will discuss the terms of the agreement, meaning it could be ongoing or a one-off deal. You could make a lot of money from it or just a decent paycheck. It all depends on the size of the brand and your level of reach.\nThese are some quick tips for partnering with brands:\nReach out to brands you actually like or that fit with your online persona: You don’t want to turn your loyal followers off by sponsoring a bad product or one that doesn’t align with your audience’s interests or beliefs. A brand collaboration should feel natural for both you and the brand.\nGet a brand’s attention by making videos featuring their product: If you’re still working your way up, you can make some quality posts featuring a brand you like. They may take notice and reach out to you.\nLet your followers know it’s a sponsored post: There’s a branded content toggle on TikTok that marks a post as sponsored. Make sure to use it so your followers know it’s an ad that you’re getting paid for.\n2. Advertise your products and services\nIf you already have your own products and services, make sure you’re using your TikTok platform to get the word out. You can also include calls to action in your videos and captions encouraging your followers to visit your online shop.\nEven if you don’t have your own merch yet, you may work your way up to that level. Always keep that in the back of your mind if you want to diversify your income streams further. Once you have a real following and loyal fans, they’ll be willing to buy products and services from you. Having an established TikTok will make it easier for you to market those products and services.\n3. Partner with an influencer\nLet’s say you have a business, but you’re not looking to make money from creating TikTok videos; you just want to use the platform for a marketing campaign. In that case, you’re going to want to reach out to an influencer or creator who aligns with your brand audience and collaborate with them.\nInfluencer marketing campaigns can be highly effective. These creators appeal to very specific niche audiences. If they have the same audience as your brand or an audience that would be interested in what you’re selling, you can instantly drive awareness by having a TikTok creator post a video that features your product or service.\nA good way to find influencers to collaborate with is the TikTok Creator Marketplace. It allows any brand in the US to join, and it makes it easy to connect with reputable creators who might be a good fit for you. You can also scroll the app and search hashtags to find potential connections. Depending on the size of your brand and your budget, you’ll want to target influencers with a small to medium-sized following. They will have a more focused audience, so you can tailor your campaign to make a bigger impact.\nRemember, you want to make sure the collaboration is a good fit. If you just choose an account randomly, you’re not going to get the maximum return on investment for your marketing dollars.\n4. Apply to TikTok’s Creator Fund\nOnce you have a decent following, you can apply to TikTok’s Creator Fund and get paid by the platform directly. This fund rewards you for your views and for creating quality videos that get engagement. Of course, there are some stipulations if you want to be eligible for the TikTok Creator Fund. \nBefore you apply, make sure you meet the following criteria:\nYou must be a resident of the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, or Spain.\nYou must be at least 18 years of age. \nYou must have at least 10,000 authentic followers.\nYou need to have at least 100,000 views in the past 30 days.\nYou must adhere to TikTok community guidelines and terms of service.\nAlso, to apply for the Creator Fund, you’ll need to upgrade to a Pro account.\n5. Accept virtual gifts\nOf course, your fans can also support you through donations and gifts. Followers can purchase gifts and coins and send them to TikTok creators; these can then be exchanged for real money.\nTo get virtual gifts, you’ll need to hold a TikTok Live. TikTok Live is a livestream feature that allows creators to stream in real-time for up to 60 minutes at a time. During this stream, you can engage with your followers, show off your talents, or do anything else you think might get people interested in watching your stream (within TikTok’s community guidelines, of course). If your fans are enjoying the stream, they can send virtual gifts. It’s a good idea to plan out some streams, so you can potentially earn money from your fans and connect with them on a deeper level.\n6. Use affiliate links\nFinally, you can use affiliate link programs to earn some extra money. When someone clicks on your affiliate links, they’re sent to a product page from your unique URL. When they purchase that product, you get some compensation for referring them.\nThe best place to put affiliate links is in your captions or in your bio. You can even mention the links in your videos so people know to go to your bio or your description to click on them.\nHow much can you make?\nThe amount of money you can make on TikTok can vary wildly from person to person. It all depends on your following and the income streams you’re using. Followers and views are the most important metrics on TikTok, so the more you get the better. Some people make a few hundred dollars per month on TikTok, while the biggest creators can make millions per year. If you want to maximize your TikTok income, you’ll have to be consistent, put in the work, and have a good strategy. Let’s jump into some quick tips for helping you get paid.\nTips for getting paid as a creator\nNow you have an idea of where your money will be coming from, but how do you get a big enough following and a sufficient number of views to start making a decent income? We’ve got some tips to get you started.\nBe consistent:\n If you’re looking at the top creators for inspiration, you’ll notice one thing they all have in common. They post \na lot\n. You need to upload engaging content consistently to keep followers interested. The more quality content you post, the more likely one or more of your videos will take off and increase your reach. Don’t be afraid to include some calls to action in your description asking your audience to follow you, share, and like your videos.\nGrow your following:\n Again, the key to TikTok success is getting a huge number of followers. The more followers you have, the more money you’ll be able to make. Being consistent and creating quality content will help with this, but you also need to market yourself and collaborate with other influencers and brands that can help boost you to the next level.\nBe true to yourself:\n People want their creators to be authentic and genuine. It might be something you don’t see a lot on social media, and that’s what makes it so much more refreshing when you do see it. If you can find a dedicated audience and carve out your niche, you’ll be able to open up a lot of opportunities for monetization.\nEngage with your audience: \nIf you have a dedicated following, don’t let that go to waste. Make sure you’re engaging with your fans in multiple ways. Respond to their comments, talk to them in livestreams, and shout them out on occasion. If they’re asking for specific content, see if you can accommodate those requests. Fans love it when the creators they follow pay attention.\nBe upfront with your audience:\n Your audience wants to see you succeed, so make sure you’re being transparent with them. When you’re doing a sponsored post, switch the branded content toggle on to let them know. You don’t need to hide the fact that you’re collaborating with brands. It comes with the success you’re gaining.\nParticipate in trends if they make sense:\n There are tons of TikTok trends that come and go. It’s a good idea to jump on a trend if it makes sense for your online persona, but don’t think you have to take part in every single trend that comes along. That could quickly backfire and will come across as inauthentic. Besides, if you only follow the trends everyone else is already doing, it doesn’t really set your profile apart much.\nGo for multiple income streams:\n As we mentioned before, the more income streams you have the better. If you can do brand collaborations, be on TikTok’s Creator Fund, and sell merch, you’re going to make a lot more money than just doing one of those things. More is better on TikTok.\nUse other social media platforms:\n Most TikTok creators have other channels that they can cross-promote and that can get them more followers. Make sure to let followers on all of your platforms know about your TikTok, your Instagram, your Twitch, etc.\nKeep in mind that these are just some general guidelines for increasing your followers, views, and income. These strategies won’t work for everyone, but if you are able to find a way to create content people are interested in, they can work for you.\nGrow with\n \nBeacons today!\nIf you’re looking to monetize your TikTok presence and grow your audience, Beacons can help.
