Milei quickly retracted support for the token, claiming he wasn’t promoting the token but simply sharing it. Understandably, Crypto Twitter was outraged by the series of events and the investigation began over the weekend, with details coming to light about how the launch had been orchestrated by a “fund manager” named Hayden Davis of Kelsier Ventures. \nDavis admitted to withdrawing ~$100M from LIBRA’s liquidity pool, framing it as a business failure, not a scam. Over the week, text messages from \nDavis obtained by CoinDesk\n alleged he bragged about “controlling” Milei via payments to Milei’s sister, Karina, though he later denied this. The fallout didn’t stop there, though, with many taking to Twitter to declare memecoins over and scrutinizing the involvement of \n \nSolana\n protocols Jupiter and Meteora, where insiders were accused of knowingly profiting from LIBRA. As a result, \nMeteora’s CEO resigned\n. LIBRA’s disaster even bled over to traditional markets which saw the Argentinian Stock Index, Merval, crash more than 5% on Monday’s market open. As expected, earlier this week, an Argentine judge was assigned to investigate Milei and the promotion of the token.\nI'm getting live reactions to Milei's Libra Memecoin from Argentines\nGoing live with:  \n-\n@fede_intern\n-\n@PabloSabbatella\n-\n@Mariandipietra\n- \n@realjuanruocco\n \n- \n@fernandezdiego\n \nCome on in!\nhttps://t.co/bwy8yjVFq1\n— David Hoffman (@TrustlessState) \nFebruary 18, 2025\n\n\n2️⃣ Bybit Hacked for over $1.5B in ETH\nEarly Friday morning, CT noticed a large outflow of ETH from a \nBybit wallet\n. Bybit’s official Twitter account later confirmed that an attack occurred during a routine transfer of ETH from their multisig cold wallet to their warm wallet, resulting in all transferred ETH being sent to the wrong address. This raised concerns among Bybit users, as they were unsure whether they would be able to withdraw their funds after such a significant loss. However, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou confirmed that all client assets are backed and that the exchange will cover the loss, even taking out a bridge loan if necessary. It also stated that it would not be buying back the ETH drained yet, causing the token to dump further. As of now, Bybit claims withdrawals are processing at normal, though may be slightly delayed due to high volume.\nBybit detected unauthorized activity involving one of our ETH cold wallets. The incident occurred when our ETH multisig cold wallet executed a transfer to our warm wallet. Unfortunately, this transaction was manipulated through a sophisticated attack that masked the signing…\n— Bybit (@Bybit_Official) \nFebruary 21, 2025\n\n\n3️⃣ \n \nMonad\n Testnet Finally Launched\nAfter two years of development, Monad’s public testnet finally went live on Wednesday.  \n8.8M wallets\n loaded their wallets with testnet tokens to play around with the chain’s new high-performance EVM environment, which can theoretically handle up to 14K transactions per second. To get you up to speed, we put together a list of \nfive high-signal opportunities\n to test out dApps in this new environment. To do so though, you’ll need to get tokens from the testnet’s faucet, \nwhich can be claimed here\n. \nMonad Testnet is live.\nTry it out here: \nhttps://t.co/QoJwPxRBTC\n \npic.twitter.com/Inzvzd5Xl1\n— Monad ⨀ (@monad_xyz) \nFebruary 19, 2025\n\n\n4️⃣ SEC Turns Things Around\nIt was a big week for the SEC, which is moving to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase, the exchange announced. This followed the SEC's announcement of a new unit called the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (CETU). The goal of this unit is to protect investors from malicious actors in the crypto and AI space. \n*SEC LAUNCHES CYBER AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES UNIT\n*SEC CYBER UNIT WILL COMBAT FRAUD IN CRYPTO AMONG OTHER AREAS\nIt appears actual crime may not be legal? \npic.twitter.com/fA0yImewNz\n— db (@tier10k) \nFebruary 20, 2025\n\n\n5️⃣ Kaito Airdrop Claims Go Live\nEarly Thursday morning, claims for the KAITO airdrop went live, culminating the end of the Yaps program so far. Some notable KOLs received \nquite large allocations\n, valued in the five- to six-figure range in USD terms, for less than 3 months' worth of tweets... Lines were drawn, though, as one of the top yappers on Kaito, agent aixbt, had its allocations revoked as Kaito said its token is reserved for humans. While details about the role the token will play in Kaito’s evolving network are still being outlined, we know it will serve as a network currency, have governance abilities, and be able to be staked.\nVery disappointing to see \n@KaitoAI\n team sneak this in at the end of the docs to specifically nerf \n@aixbt_agent\n from getting the airdrop\nThe #1 KOL in the space \nAIXBT is the definition of their thesis of \"InfoFI\" and the \"Attention Economy\"\n$KAITO\n \n$AIXBT\n \npic.twitter.com/KkrKxjzvqn\n— Topher (@TopherGMI) \nFebruary 20, 2025",

Say hello to BoLD – a newly deployed proving protocol that opens the floodgates for permissionless validation and crushes centralization concerns.\nStage 2 rollups do indeed exist, but they have struggled to achieve meaningful adoption. The largest such example, DeGate’s ZK rollup, custodies less than 1% of Arbitrum’s value and \nranks\n 21st against competitive L2s in terms of total value secured.\nWith Arbitrum’s BoLD deployment, its L2 ecosystem is on the brink of realizing Vitalik’s scaling endgame: truly decentralized and performant blockspace for the masses. This major technical achievement could crown the Arbitrum tech stack as king among L2s and stands to strengthen the credible neutrality of Ethereum’s rollup construct.\nLet’s break down Arbitrum’s latest upgrade and discuss the lone hurdle the network must overcome to fully decentralize. 👇\n💪 What is BoLD?\nPreviously, the ability to validate an Arbitrum chain was restricted to \nwhitelisted\n parties approved by the ArbitrumDAO. These select validators bore all responsibility for posting updates about the Arbitrum network to Ethereum, challenging inaccurate claims made by other validators, and confirming valid attestations.\nAlthough this trusted validation scheme mitigated the risk of “\ndelay attacks\n,” in which malicious entities infinitely spam the fraud resolution process to prevent the publication of Arbitrum state roots on Ethereum, it imposed unwanted centralization risk vectors that prevented anyone from permissionlessly challenging inaccurate claims made by network validators.\nArbitrum’s BoLD, short for Bounded Liquidity Delay Protocol, ensures that all validation disputes are resolved within a fixed period (currently equivalent to two challenge periods of 6.4 days, plus a two-day grace period for the Security Council to intervene if necessary), effectively nullifying the risk of a delay attack.\nToday, BoLD delivers permissionless validation, making the Arbitrum ecosystem more secure and more decentralized than ever.\nAnyone can defend Arbitrum.\nStage 2 soon. \npic.twitter.com/y6y1WDTSwc\n— Arbitrum (@arbitrum) \nFebruary 12, 2025\n\n\nTo ensure that \nanyone\n with the requisite technical sophistication can permissionlessly challenge incorrect Arbitrum state roots, BoLD enables multiple parties to initiate the fraud challenge process by pooling capital and proposing their own version of the correct chain history.\nIn addition to the good feeling they’ll get from altruistically preserving the correct version of Arbitrum’s onchain history, honest actors are financially incentivized to challenge an incorrect state by the “Defender Bounty,” which allocates 1% of a malicious state root proposer’s funds to winning challenger groups.\n🧐 What’s Next For Arbitrum?\nIn this bold new world, anyone can validate, propose, and defend an Arbitrum chain’s state without permission.\nWhile Arbitrum will retain its Security Council – essentially a multi-signature wallet that can unilaterally override any decision and make instantaneous chain changes at any time – and thus cannot be considered a Stage 2 rollup at this time, the launch of BoLD permissionless state validation puts Arbitrum on the precipice of achieving the designation.\nSource: \nL2Beat\nAs long as its Security Council has the ability to alter network outcomes in the absence of bugs, it will be impossible for Arbitrum to fully decentralize, but with the groundwork for the transition having already been laid, it may only be a matter of time before Arbitrum becomes the first rollup of significance to achieve Ethereum’s scaling endgame!",

Given the amount of \"yapping\" that Kaito fuels and its token debut this week, it's a good time to understand how the platform works. \nAddressing InfoFi\nKaito’s core philosophy revolves around the concept of “\nInfoFi\n,” where market forces—rather than centralized platform algorithms—determine how attention is distributed. \nOf course, social media echo chambers and algorithmic biases often lead to suboptimal or unfair outcomes. In contrast, InfoFi seeks to harness the wisdom of actual network participants, letting them dictate which voices and topics deserve attention and thus gain traction. This is where \nyaps \ncome in, a vehicle for tokenizing attention.\nKaito Yaps & Connect\nGoing beyond the dashboard functionality of Kaito Pro, Yaps and Connect fuse into a novel incentive framework aimed at crowdsourcing high-quality crypto analysis and engagement. \nThrough the Yaps protocol\n—which culminated in yesterday's token generation event (TGE)—participants are awarded \"Yap points\" for well-researched content on Twitter, like meticulous protocol breakdowns or detailed critiques.\nKaito's AI judges each entry for relevance, originality, and engagement and filters out those it deems low effort. The contributors with the best posts are premiered on a leaderboard which helps track their influence over time, helping surface which community members create the most value. \nTied into the Yaps Protocol is \nKaito Connect\n, which serves as the network's nerve center, channeling these curated insights directly to dApps or ecosystems. By blending AI analytics with market-based incentives, Connect reimagines how both attention and capital move throughout the ecosystem. \nFor instance, a DAO could automatically gauge ongoing community sentiment on a governance proposal, while a brand might launch a Yapper campaign where budgets and exposure are contingent on verifiable creator performance. \nThe Yapper Launchpad\n \nThe \nYapper Launchpad\n completes the Kaito ecosystem trifecta, offering a stage for new projects to harness Kaito’s AI-driven ranking model. \nEach week, three initiatives make their debut with their own dedicated Yapper Leaderboard, tapping into a gamified structure that spurs community engagement and highlights top contributors.  \nMeanwhile, the AI-backed scoring system helps identify who’s creating real impact, filtering out noise, and surfacing potential marketing partners. The feedback loop here helps projects refine their outreach and, for high performers, distribute rewards efficiently. \n$KAITO\nAs of yesterday, $KAITO, the token of Kaito, is officially live, with 10% available immediately and another 32.2% earmarked for “\nEcosystem & Network Growth\n,” likely implying more rounds of rewards. \nThe first round proved quite lucrative for top yappers, with a small set of influencers earning as much as \n$200-$300k\n for less than 3 months of tweeting. \nBeyond just stimulating the market though, $KAITO also holds multiple functions within the platform’s network, such as:\nStaking\n — You can lock your tokens for sKAITO to receive boosted voting power and rewards, with particular focus on those who \nstaked over 75%\n of their claimed supply. Currently, \n~16% of claimed\n $KAITO is being staked to earn \n~50% APR\n.\nNetwork Currency \n—\n \n$KAITO is a \nmedium of exchange\n for transactions and interactions across the ecosystem’s platforms.\nGovernance Mechanism \n— The token also facilitates decentralized decision making, allowing holders to propose and vote on protocol and algorithm changes over time.\nIn the months ahead, as Kaito refines its InfoFi vision and deepens the interplay between AI curation and community-driven analysis, the platform appears well-positioned to play a major role in how attention and capital flows in our industry. \nWhile exact details about the road ahead here remain hazy, the expansion of the Yaps system to additional social media platforms seems likely, though \nwhere \nwould be the question. \nAll that said, the big idea this week is that Kaito's token launch has introduced a new way to surface signal and reward creators in crypto, so it's worth keeping an eye on going forward. \nWhile much hinges on continued growth and the exact implementation of upcoming features, the platform's multifaceted network design and emphasis on token-based incentives suggests it has the foundation for what could become a new paradigm in market intelligence. For now, only time will tell!",

That's because each of these high-profile projects currently have NFT-centric opportunities ramping up that you should have on your radar. \nLet's dig in and catch you up on the big ideas. \nWarpcast Wallet\n \nFarcaster\n is the \n \nEthereum\n ecosystem's most popular decentralized social network, and it's got lots of tailwinds working in its favor presently, like the \nrise of Snapchain\n and the \narrival of Frames V2\n. \nNow, it's got another ace up its sleeve: Warpcast Wallet. \nwarpcast wallet is a game changer for crypto ux\nany onchain interaction, in one mobile app, with social context\ndemo of sponsoring your favorite pod using pods frame \nhttps://t.co/0G1UzfR2Ds\n \npic.twitter.com/wfqwEQimOU\n— woj (@superwoj) \nFebruary 12, 2025\n\n\nWarpcast is the flagship Farcaster app, and its builders have started rolling out a new embedded wallet to its mobile users. \nThe idea? Make \nin-feed UX slicker\n and ensure that most Farcaster users have funded wallets so they can more readily access Frames, NFT mints, and beyond. \nThere's no question that this is going to become one of the premier ways to interact with opportunities around the Farcaster ecosystem in the months ahead, so it's worth updating your Warpcast app and seeing if you've got early access to the new wallet system. \nIf so, fund it by depositing some ETH, and then you can start trading, playing, minting, etc. Afterwards, any NFTs you mint on Warpcast will appear in your wallet's \"Collectibles\" tab for easy management. \nOS2 XP Update\nLast week, NFT marketplace heavyweight \n \nOpenSea\n confirmed its \n$SEA token plans\n and rolled out the public beta of its madeover OS2 platform.  \nThe token news unsurprisingly caused a stir, considering OpenSea's long history. \nBut there was also a potent wave of backlash on social media around OS2's XP system, with complaints that it was too much like Blur farming, i.e. most rewarding of the people who \nrapidly buy and sell NFTs back and forth\n to rack up points rather than genuine collectors. \nOpenSea heard the feedback and made adjustments, with CEO Devin Finzer recently announcing a pause on XP rewards for listing and bidding while the team focuses on XP shipments, which are rewarded for certain achievements. \nwe've heard the feedback on the current XP system, and we're putting a pause on XP given directly for listing and bidding\nwhile we don’t think liquidity rewards are inherently bad (see more below), we understand that there are a lot of strong emotions towards point systems, and…\n— dfinzer.eth | opensea (@dfinzer) \nFebruary 18, 2025\n\n\nThe last round of XP was distributed to people who bought an NFT on OS2, with bonus points included for holders of top-volume collections who had held for longer than 3 months. \nI suspect we'll see more shipments like this that reward holder behaviors, so if there are any NFTs you've been eyeing for your personal collection, OS2's new update is an opportunity to up your $SEA eligibility. \nIf you're just casually interested in stacking some XP, focus on affordable projects that see lots of trading activity to maximize your chances. For example, consider \nCourtyard\n, the tokenized collectibles platform whose cards currently have a floor price of 0.0024 ETH on OS2.  \n \nMonad\n Tesnet\nNow that Abstract and Berachain are live, one of the next big chains coming up is Monad, a high-performance, Ethereum-compatible L1. The good news? We can start surfing here today because the developers just released \nthe Monad Testnet\n.\nThere's already a spate of NFT apps deployed on this test network, so it's a good time to begin getting your bearings on Monad. \nTo dive in, you can use a wallet that offers native support for the testnet, like Phantom, or you can manually add the testnet to your wallet at \ntestnet.monad.xyz\n.\nIf you manually add the testnet to one of your existing wallets, check your balance to see if you were one of the \n+8.8 million Ethereum addresses\n that received an airdrop of $MON test tokens.\nOtherwise, the \ntestnet.monad.xyz\n platform offers a $MON faucet, and there are community faucets \nlike Gaz.zip\n that you can alternatively try—in any case, once you have some $MON you can start paying for transactions on the network.\nAt this point, you'll be ready to start exploring apps and mints. For example:\nLil Chogstars\n, an upcoming PFP collection on Monad, is hosting a commemorative \nopen-edition drop\n where you can mint up to 10 NFTs for 0.004 $MON a pop. \nMonadverse\n, a storytelling project, is hosting \na mint campaign\n where you can collect each chapter of its story as an NFT, and if you collect them all, you get access to perks from partners across the Monad ecosystem, e.g. allowlist spots for upcoming collections.\nMagic Eden\n, the multichain NFT marketplace, has a \ndedicated Monad hub\n where you can discover and mint from ongoing launchpad drops or use the Mint Terminal to create your own 1/1s or collections on the testnet.\nFantasy Top\n, the social betting game that was first popularized on Blast, is hosting a \nFree to Play tournament\n tomorrow, Feb. 20th, on the Monad testnet; if you sign up today, you can dive in by claiming 15 starter cards and try your hand at winning some rare NFT prizes.",

These so-called low-float, high-FDV (fully diluted value) token launches gave venture investors all of the early upside and ensured that a lack of volatility at launch meant insiders got paid. \nCobie's musings triggered some solution hunting and he ended up shipping Echo, an investment app built for, “allowing onchain natives to invest together.” The product \nlaunched in beta\n nearly a year ago, and since then, \n238 deals have been facilitated\n using Echo by 7,654 unique investors and just under $100M total raised. The firm has been capturing more and more attention in recent months, led by MegaETH's $10M raise from the platform in December.\nTo understand more about why Echo is having a moment, we have to take a step back and learn what \n \nCobie\n means by low-float high-FDV.\nWhat is \nlow-float, high-FDV\n?\nFour years ago, Cobie wrote a buzzy post about how to calculate FDV, market cap, unlocks, and founding team interests. In \nOn the meme of market caps & unlocks\n, he described the dynamics among projects, investors and founders \"to maximise their fully diluted market cap (and thus private wealth) by funneling as much open market $ into the smallest float possible. By doing this, a project can create vast paper profits for investors and the team.”\nFast forward three years and nothing really changed. Teams were still using the same token launch structure and it was still hurting the general public, discouraging more early investors who remain down-only on bets they took advantage of at their earliest entry.\nLast year, Cobie released another substack article titled, “\nNew launches (part 1) - private capture, phantom pricing\n” where he discusses these issues and misconceptions in the market and \nwhat he wanted to do to change it.\nDon’t Buy That Hot New Token on Bankless\nThe (fully diluted) valuations are too damn high.\nBankless\nJack Inabinet May 20, 2024 • 3 min read\nWhat is Echo?\nEcho aims to democratize private investment in crypto companies, aiming to make early-stage crypto investments less of an elitist club and more of a community party for seasoned investors. The platform is still limited by securities regulations, so stateside that means accredited investors only sadly, but its efforts to open early stage opportunities inside crypto to a wider swath of investors than VCs offers a more attractive model even if it's not quite at Pump.fun levels of permissionlessness.\nvia Echo's \nwebsite\nThe platform hosts a system where lead investors create groups, and members can jump in on deals, all managed onchain. It's like a decentralized venture capital fund where the community decides what they want to fund.\nRecently, \nMegaETH’s $10M raise\n made waves across the ecosystem as it showed the power of Echo under this collective energy – selling out in less than \n3 minutes\n - while also signifying a shift in how community-aligned founders opt to raise funding for their project. \nSee this quote from \nThe Block\n's reporting on the raise:\n\"Crypto has long been plagued by high insider supply and limited community involvement,\" [MegaETH’s Shuyao] Kong said. \"At MegaLabs, we're committed to ensuring the community has real skin in the game. We are essentially following Ethereum\n's footsteps by prioritizing community ownership.\"\nWhat does this all mean?\nThis is all pretty exciting news for an industry that's desperately been searching for a new path forward for projects selling tokens to the community that still promote long-term thinking for the founders of said projects. And while it's exciting for normie accredited investors, there are reasons crypto VCs should be worried by the trend.\nEcho is a step towards decentralization, a decentralization from the centralizing forces of venture capital. With Echo, accredited investors have more influence over the early stages of startups, making these deals less exclusive and therefore potentially less lucrative. Echo also brings more transparency and efficiency to the table as all of the terms are finalized using USDC onchain.\nYes, venture capital is a big industry, and Echo is just getting started, but as the crypto community looks for more paths forward when it comes to building lasting value onchain, it's an exciting start.",

Here’s what we’ve been up to over the past 21 months at Bankless Ventures, including deals we’ve done, results we’ve seen, and a thing or two we've learned.\nBack in April of 2023, we launched Bankless Ventures. \nOur thesis at the time was simple: We believed a small fund with a powerful brand could punch well above its weight class. \nOver the past 21 months, we’ve been able to test that thesis as Ryan, Ben, and I evolved from opportunistic angel investors to competitive deal-winners. As angels, deal flow often found us. But as VCs, we had to secure that deal flow in a fiercely competitive ecosystem.\nCould Bankless Ventures succeed?\n In order to win, we had to answer yes to these four questions:\nCan we get into the right deals?\nCan we deliver massive value to our portcos? \nCan we keep nailing hits? \nCan we build the best team? \nNow that \nBankless Ventures Fund I\n is 90% deployed and our gaze turns to \nFund II\n, let’s take a moment to evaluate our performance and measure results.  \nCan we get into the right deals? ✅\nKeeping \nFund I\n small (under $40 million) was the right call. Our nimble size has allowed us to slip meaningful checks into early-stage deals, where larger VCs simply cannot fit. The combination of a powerful brand with $500K check sizes has allowed us to consistently win the deals we’ve wanted at stages optimized for venture scale returns. Most boutique funds fail to get on the cap table–larger players squeeze them out, and founders don’t know the reputation. Bankless is different.  \n\"It feels like I'm on the podcast\"\n is the number one quote we hear when joining a pitch call. Almost every founder we talk to has already spent hours listening to Bankless and knows our values before we enter the chat. Some thank us for getting them into crypto. This helps accelerate the deal-making process.\nWhen they know us, they trust us, and want us involved. This is how we won our position in some of the most hotly contested deals of the last funding cycle.\nCan we deliver massive value to our portcos? ✅\nOur value proposition to portcos is the two \nN\ns: \nNarrative liquidity and network liquidity. \nNarrative liquidity\n is the ability to propagate a story in crypto–this industry thrives on stories, and we are good at telling stories that scale. We drive education and understanding about the sectors that we also invest in–to great effect. \nNetwork liquidity \nis who you know; it's the total value of your network, and we have found ourselves in the fortunate position of being 1 to 2 degrees of separation from the key people a founder needs to give their project rocket fuel–a well-timed introduction to the right person is worth millions.\nBillions in capital listens to Bankless on a weekly basis and uses Bankless as a signal for large trends in the industry as a whole. The themes that Bankless has pounded the table on (DeFi, L1s as money, L2s) have focused outside capital into the same themes that Bankless Ventures invests in. \nWhile remaining neutral about specific portfolio companies, \nBankless has been able to direct attention, talent and capital toward the sectors that excite us.\nCan we keep nailing hits? ✅\nWe've nailed many of the major value accrual themes of crypto during our first seven years as investors. We saw Ethereum in 2016 as programmable money; we saw DeFi in 2019 as composable money legos; we saw L2s in 2020 as high-bandwidth blockspace–we’ve captured many of the deca-corns that crypto has birthed.  \nBut the past is not always a predictor of future success, and for each new year, there's the question of \nwhether we can keep nailing the hits.\n Our record in \nFund I\n says \nyes\n. We nailed several of the frontier investment categories early on in this, with strong, high-ROI bets across restaking, zkProver tech, Bitcoin L2s, and Crypto x AI.\nOn the back of \nFund I\n successes, we have further confidence that our approach to identifying, vetting, and making heat-seeking conviction plays is scalable and repeatable in \nFund II\n. \nFund I\n is still early in its return cycle, but we deployed aggressively in 2023 and 2024 with purpose–we aimed to sow during the build market and reap the benefits during the bull market. While the typical venture cycle J-curve means that returns are often negative in the first few years of a fund, we are currently showing returns of 2.3x MOIC. (Next time I write an article reflecting on Bankless Ventures performance, I look forward to discussing DPI instead of MOIC)\n*MOIC: Not discounted, calculated as of 8-January-2025, see disclaimer for further details\nCan we build the best team? ✅\nRyan and I bootstrapped Bankless Media from zero to a profitable 8-figure ARR business within a year without outside capital. Today, Bankless Media has a talented leadership team and 20 contributors who help us run it day-to-day.\nWe built a media company, but could we build a Venture Fund with the operational excellence of the best funds in tech? The answer again has been \nyes\n.\nWith full-time chad leadership from Ben Lakoff – and Ryan and I solely incentivized by fund performance, not salaries – Bankless Ventures \nFund I\n has been resourced as a $100M fund at a $40M size. \nOur superb team also boasts \nBrent Matterson\n focused on deal sourcing and curation, \nKim Adams\n on providing portfolio support, and \nRyan O’Meara\n dialed in on operations. \nIn \nFund II\n we’re bringing an additional investment partner to our bench. This to-be-announced addition is one of the best crypto investors we know; he’ll specialize in “truffle-hunting” for incredible founding teams and deals we can lead, allowing us to get more surgical and enter opportunities even earlier. Stay tuned!\nWe’re raising $50M for \nFund II\nTo recap, yes, we get in the right deals, we deliver massive value to portcos, we nail the hits, we have the team. We’ve never been better positioned to deploy capital in crypto.\nWe’ve just officially started raising for \nFund II\n, and already have a ton of interest from great partners. Today, we’re opening up LP applications for \nFund II\n. We want to talk to you.  \nSubmit Interest Form\nWhat’s next on the crypto frontier?\nTrillions of AI agents going bankless\nStablecoins bringing open finance to the world \nZK tech solving identity, privacy, and opening 1000 new rabbit holes\nNo matter where it happens, we’ll be there. Because this is the frontier, it’s not for everyone, but we’re glad you’re with us on the bankless journey.",

With Gary Gensler gone and the SEC now under new management, his administration stands ready to deliver on the agenda with digital asset regulatory clarity.   \nIn our \nlatest episode of Bankless\n, SEC Commissioner \n \nHester Peirce\n – an outspoken advocate for digital asset liberties and regulatory restraint – joined David Hoffman to discuss the implications of changing agency leadership on crypto’s future.\nDay one of the Trump Administration saw Commissioner Peirce \nappointed\n as head of the SEC’s freshly formed Crypto Task Force, and its first move was \nrescinding\n SAB 121, a controversial accounting policy that restricted financial institutions from offering crypto custody services.\nAlthough Gary Gensler’s relentless trickle of crypto lawsuits traumatized industry participants and discouraged engagement with American regulators, Commissioner Peirce hopes to build healthy relationships with crypto projects and encourage experimentation through practical solutions that uphold regulation.\nWe didn’t get all the answers, but it was certainly refreshing to hear a lead crypto regulator finally engaging with the industry! Here’s how Hester responded to the crypto industry’s top 5 pressing concerns. \n👇\n1️⃣ Regulatory Clarity for Tokens\nOne of the biggest shifts is the potential retroactive regulatory relief for token issuers. Peirce outlined a roadmap whereby projects that issued tokens in the past can gain legal clarity by providing disclosures and agreeing to certain conditions.\nFor years, the SEC's aggressive stance against tokens has discouraged transparency, leaving many projects afraid that disclosures could be used against them in future enforcement actions. Commissioner Peirce hopes to flip that dynamic by encouraging voluntary disclosures.\n2️⃣ No-Action Letters\nPeirce discussed the no-action letter process, which allows companies to request an official statement from the SEC confirming that a specific activity will not result in an enforcement action.\nThe SEC continues to solicit input from the crypto industry on how these processes should work, as it did under Gensler, and interested parties can reach out directly to provide feedback via the email: crypto@sec.gov.\n3️⃣ Securities Laws and Crypto\nHistorically, being labeled a security has been a death sentence for crypto tokens in the U.S. due to the regulatory burdens it imposes. But does it have to be that way?\nPeirce acknowledged that while some crypto assets will clearly fit within securities laws, the industry needs new frameworks to accommodate decentralized networks.\nShe also touched on meme coins, stating that just because something is popular doesn’t necessarily make it a security, but warned individuals against assuming that the SEC (or any regulator) will act as a safety net for those making speculative bets.\n4️⃣ Airdrops and Retail Access to Crypto\nCrypto projects often exclude U.S. citizens from their airdrops over fears they could become embroiled in legal troubles with securities regulators.\nWhile Commissioner Peirce didn’t provide a definitive answer on airdrops, she signaled that the SEC is working on clearer guidance and encouraged projects to submit scenarios to the Crypto Task Force so they can better understand what the industry needs.\nAdditionally, Peirce indicated openness towards modernizing American financial regulations and expanding private market access through novel investor accreditation standards.\n5️⃣ The SEC’s Relationship with the CFTC\nUnder previous leadership, the SEC and CFTC had an almost territorial fight over which agency would regulate crypto. Peirce expressed optimism that this will change, emphasizing that collaboration between regulators is now a priority.\nRather than seeking jurisdictional dominance, Commissioner Peirce hopes regulators will work together to create frameworks that actually make sense for crypto markets.\nDon’t miss our exclusive interview with Commissioner Peirce. 👇\nSEC’s Crypto Task Force: A New Era for Regulation? | Hester Peirce on Bankless\nPro Crypto SEC\nBankless",

Create an interconnected ecosystem and gaming economy where players and game creators can earn rewards for their activity. I'll cover all the basics below in case you want to dive in. \nHow B3 works\nB3 is what's called a Layer 3 (L3) network. This is because the chain settles its transactions to Base, a Layer 2 (L2) on top of Ethereum. \nSpecifically, B3 is a type of scaling solution known as an \noptimium\n. \nWhen you combine offchain execution with onchain data via fraud proofs, you get a regular optimistic rollup L2. When you do offchain execution \nand \npublish data offchain, e.g. like how B3 posts data to Celestia, you get an optimium. \nThis design introduces a trust assumption, namely that posted data will remain available. But in exchange for this added trust, optimiums can offer high transaction throughput, making B3 great for gaming use cases. \nB3 is also developing a rollup engine that will allow games in its ecosystem to create their own L3 \nGamechains\n for greater customizability while still sharing an interconnected economy with the wider B3 ecosystem. \nHow to get started\nSince B3 is compatible with the \n \nEthereum\n Virtual Machine (EVM) and uses ETH as its gas token, it's easy to start exploring the chain if you already have an Ethereum wallet\n. \nFirst you'll want to add the B3 network to your wallet, which you can \ndo manually\n or using a service like \nChainList\n.\nNext you can bridge some ETH to your B3 account using a fast bridge like \nRelay\n, which makes it simple to deposit in from Ethereum, Base, and beyond. \nOnce you've got your wallet ready, start finding and trying B3 games through BSMNT (\nbasement.fun\n), which is a streamlined \"frontpage\" discovery hub you can use to sort through titles by \"Top Rated,\" \"Recently Added,\" \"Genre,\" etc. \nIf you want to dive deeper, you can also consider acquiring some of the network's native token $B3, which lives on \n \nBase\n and is traded on centralized exchanges like \nCoinbase\n or decentralized exchanges like \nAerodrome\n.\nHolding $B3 lets you participate in B3 governance and receive early access to new BSMNT features, but the main opportunity is in \nstaking\n, where you can deposit $B3 to earn tokens from future Gamechain launches. \nWhat to watch for\nThe B3 team has already onboarded nearly 100 games to its network and ecosystem. Look for them to double down on welcoming bigger titles and facilitating more Gamechain launches this year\n. \nThanks to a recent announcement, we know B3 is on track for \n5 Gamechain releases\n in Q1 2025.\nThe first and biggest Gamechain announced was \nPrime Chain\n, which is being developed by Echelon, the creators of the hit crypto trading card game \nParallel\n. \nPrime Chain will be used to support Echelon's next game, nicknamed \nProject Tau Ceti\n, a 3rd-person extraction shooter set in the Parallel universe that is slated for a Q3 2025 release.\nIf B3 can continue to foster collaborations like this, and a $B3 flywheel ensues, then the network's ecosystem will become an increasingly attractive hub for high-quality games—keep it on your radar accordingly.",

Let's catch you up on why this matters and what to expect going forward.\ndTAO\n, or dynamic TAO, marks a major change in Bittensor’s tokenomics by giving each of the network's specialized subnets its own token, paired with TAO in a dedicated liquidity pool. \nInstead of subnets competing for a shared TAO reward and relying on a single group of validators to rank them, each subnet’s value now rises or falls based on genuine demand via the users, stakers, and validators who adopt it.\nThis approach tackles the scalability challenge of ranking an ever-growing list of subnets, but it also enforces true market-based valuations, letting the most useful subnets thrive while less valuable ones fade.\nEssentially, the entire network “game” is now different: \nMiners\n, who provide the AI services or computational work that make each subnet useful, now earn the subnet’s \nown \ntoken instead of TAO, forcing them to decide between quick selling and long-term investment. \nStakers\n, who secure the network by locking up tokens, can no longer just stake TAO for guaranteed rewards—they now have to pick specific subnet tokens to buy, and they also risk missing out if they back the wrong ones. \nValidators\n, who measure and manage the performance of subnets, must hold a given subnet’s token to validate it, turning their choice of which subnets to serve into a high-stakes bet. \nFinally, \nowners\n, who create each subnet, receive their rewards in that subnet’s token and must build genuine value or hype or else risk devaluing their project’s currency.\nOver the coming weeks, expect some wild volatility in everything Bittensor as the network adjusts to its new economic model, packed with some big but planned downward pressure around subnets given the \nRoot Proportion sell-pressure mechanism\n that will be pronounced during these early days. \nIn the meantime, if you're interested in diving deeper into the Bittensor ecosystem, it’s best to study up on \nthe subnets out there\n. Also, take a look at some of the \ninitial venues\n for interacting with dTAO!",

The project relies on a specialized node setup, optimized block production, and other holistic performance upgrades to build a next-generation system. What does all of that actually mean? Let’s take a closer look.\n🧱 Specialized Nodes\nMegaETH uses four different node types, with varying hardware requirements, to create fast, efficient block production. First, a single sequencer rapidly organizes transactions and produces new blocks every 1–10 milliseconds, so confirmations feel near instant. Replica nodes receive only the results of those transactions, making their job lighter and allowing them to run on simpler hardware. Full nodes re-check every transaction to provide people with strong security guarantees. Meanwhile, prover nodes handle cryptographic proofs behind the scenes so the main network can keep running quickly, unburdened by the work needed to complete these. \n⏱️ Optimized Blocks\nAs mentioned, MegaETH targets block times in milliseconds. Further, though, it adjusts how many transactions fit in each block based on how quickly the network’s different nodes can work. It also charges extra fees for actions that update the network’s state more heavily, which helps avoid slowdowns during peak usage — an issue that often plagues other EVM-based blockchains. By combining ultra-fast blocks, flexible gas management, and a two-step finality approach (where \n \nEthereum\n confirms everything in the background), MegaETH can theoretically stay reliable and efficient even under heavy demand.\n🏎️ Full Performance Boost \nMegaETH doesn’t just speed up one part of the EVM; it overhauls everything. The chain hands off large \ndata tasks to EigenDA\n, allowing the single sequencer to focus on staying fast instead of navigating storage constraints. It also uses methods like parallel indexing to manage tens of thousands of transactions per second. While many blockchains run into trouble if they optimize one piece but ignore others, leading to delays in syncing data or confirming transactions, MegaETH aims to keep the entire process real-time, an ambitious task traders will soon be able to judge for themselves in testnet.\n🧊 State Improvements\nFinally, MegaETH novelly organizes data to process transactions at these high speeds. It keeps key information in memory instead of on slower disk storage, letting it read or write data almost instantly. After each batch of transactions, the sequencer sends only the changes (rather than the full transaction history) to other nodes, so they don’t have to redo all the work themselves. MegaETH also improves how it records account balances and other network details, avoiding the slowdowns that commonly occur when blockchains update their data structures too often. Altogether, this allows MegaETH to shoot for 100K transactions per second while still producing blocks every few milliseconds.\n5️⃣ Five Projects Building on MegaETH\nWhile the speed MegaETH aims for would smooth over and augment the experience of using the crypto apps we are already familiar with, it also aims to open up a new realm of design space for applications that require immediate, scalable onchain interactions. Below are five upcoming projects on MegaETH that showcase the chain's strengths.\n🥰 Euphoria\nEuphoria intends to reimagine derivatives trading as something fun, social, and accessible. \nInstead of forcing people to learn complicated finance tools, Euphoria introduces “\nTap Trading\n,” where users make predictions on price movements with a quick tap, presenting everything through a game-like user interface designed for mobile. The experience intends to be inherently social and gamified, with features like a chat, point systems, and rewards that can turn trading into a friendly competition. With MegaETH’s speedy finality, Euphoria can provide real-time price updates, immediate payouts, and a fun, efficiency-driven atmosphere reminiscent of social media platforms like TikTok.\nWe’re coming out of stealth–and it’s time to get euphoric. ✨\nFor too long, trading has been designed to feel serious, complex, and stressful. But it doesn’t have to be.\nToday, that changes.\nIntroducing Euphoria - where trading becomes an experience. 🧵 👇 \npic.twitter.com/QqlSVfRKsA\n— Euphoria (@Euphoria_fi) \nJanuary 13, 2025\n\n\n🎮 Sweep\nSweep transforms livestream entertainment into an interactive experience where viewers can make real-time predictions on streamers and live events. \nWhether it be betting on who will “\nwin a map\n” or how many kills a streamer may get, the platform supports instant live predictions that let users place and resolve bets within moments, heightening engagement across live broadcasts. Due to the speed of gaming, swift settlement is required to facilitate these predictions. This is where MegaETH’s millisecond-measured block times come in, improving on the current Web 2 rails, which power Sweep at the moment. Keep track of \nSweep’s development here\n.\nThe future of entertainment isn’t just about watching — it’s about living every moment.\nThis is why we are building Sweep, a way to win money by making real-time predictions on your favorite streamers and live events.

Further, MegaETH's community focus, with the Echo raise and Fluffle mint, offers a fresh take on the tired, exclusively VC-backed model, setting MegaETH up with a broader base of supporters from the get-go. \nThe chain's novel approach to its launch and design appears to be influencing the projects it has been attracting early-on, with early builders heavily skewed toward both SocialFi and DeFi. A diverse early bench of apps hints at an eventful future public testnet launch for MegaETH, one early supporters hope will also prove to inject new capital and some much-needed better vibes into the Ethereum ecosystem overall.",

With Quintenz at the helm, the agency could emerge as the industry’s preferred regulator, shifting oversight away from the SEC.\nNew incoming CFTC chair is posting on Farcaster \nhttps://t.co/wLs4ZoIm6m\n— David Hoffman (@TrustlessState) \nFebruary 12, 2025",

The move means \nanyone \ncan now launch anything—not just games or NFT apps—on the chain. \n1/ The Golden Age of \n \nRonin\n Starts NOW!\nWe have just submitted a transaction to break down the allowlist for deploying contracts on Ronin.\nFrom this moment forward, Ronin is open.\nHere’s what this grand opening means for our movement 🧵👇 \npic.twitter.com/Wmr3Pimaqb\n— Ronin (@Ronin_Network) \nFebruary 12, 2025\n\n\nWhy it matters\nLaunched in 2021 by Axie Infinity creators Sky Mavis, Ronin has become home to a growing number of non-Axie franchises and boasts impressive stats, like 1.7 million monthly active addresses and +$4 billion in all-time NFT volume. \nRonin notched these activity levels while it was still in a curated, permissioned state. Now that the network is open to all builders, the Ronin ecosystem just became that much more attractive for developers of all stripes (AI, DeFi, etc.), and it's poised for a new wave of growth and experiments accordingly. \nAlso worth noting is that this move is the first of two major evolutions for the Ronin ecosystem, with the second being the upcoming mainnet launch of the Ronin zkEVM, which will allow Ronin projects to release their own bespoke Layer 2 networks. \nTop Ronin games to explore\nWith Ronin going permissionless, it's an interesting time to dive into some of the top titles on the chain. There are lots of options to choose from, so you can gravitate toward whatever suits your tastes. \nI'd recommend some starting points like...\n🏆\n \nAxie Origins\n — The flagship Axie Infinity game, which you can play for free upon downloading and receiving your first starter Axies\n⚔️\n \nCambria\n — A Runescape-inspired massively multiplayer online game (MMO) where you can win onchain stakes via PvP battles\n🧭\n \nFableborne\n — A free-to-play mobile game with strategy and role-playing game (RPG) elements\n🧝\n \nForgotten Runiverse\n — A free-to-play fantasy MMORPG by the creators of the Forgotten Runes Wizard's Cult, slated for a Q1 2025 early access launch\n🐲\n \nKuroro Beasts\n — A team building out a trio of games atop Ronin, i.e. Kuroro Brawls, Kuroro Ranch, and Kuroro Wilds\n🧱\n \nLumiterra\n — An open-world, multiplayer survival crafting game where players farm, battle, and collect mysterious creatures\n🌴\n \nNifty Island\n — The multiplayer gaming platform is currently working on integrating its Play-to-Earn rewards system with Ronin\n🏴‍☠️\n \nPirate Nation\n — The onchain pirate RPG is preparing to rollout free-to-play support for Ronin players\n🌾\n \nPixels\n — The most popular title on Ronin, this is an open-world and free-to-play farming game\n🏀\n \nRumble Kong League\n — A 3-on-3 basketball mobile game \nThe big picture\nCambria migrated to Ronin from Blast, Kuroro Beasts migrated from Arbitrum, Fableborne migrated from Avalanche, etc. Look for more titles to make similar leaps over in the coming months now that the network is wide open. \nThese moves make a lot of sense, seeing as how Ronin has \ngreat user retention stats\n, better even than top chains like Base and Solana. As 1kx partner Peter Pan \nrecently put it\n, \"Ronin users are the highest quality and highest retaining in crypto.\"\nAs more projects migrate over then and new native titles launch permissionlessly, it's no stretch to assume that there could be 100-200 games live on Ronin at this point next year. \nBut that's not all that's on the way, either. Now that any project can deploy on Ronin, it seems likely that the passionate Ronin user base can propel the network to becoming one of the biggest contenders in the consumer crypto arena with new non-gaming apps around DeFi, DePin, and beyond. \nHow to dive in\nCreate a Ronin Wallet\nFund your wallet using the Ronin Bridge\nRegister a Ronin Name Service domain\nMake a trade on the Katana DEX\nBuy an NFT on Ronin Market\nStake some $RON for staking rewards\nPlay new Ronin games",

Today, we're sharing a quick guide on the first decentralized exchange built on the V4 infra – \nBunni v2\n. \nThe wait is over.\nBunni v2 is LIVE on \n \nEthereum\n Mainnet, \n@Base\n, and \n@Arbitrum\n! 🐰🥕\nAs the first DEX built on top of Uniswap v4, Bunni v2 offers programmable liquidity features that help LPs build yield-maximized, dynamic, and automated liquidity pools. Our rehypothecation hook… \npic.twitter.com/OjkSaa7wLf\n— Bunni (@bunni_xyz) \nFebruary 1, 2025\n\n\nI encourage you to \ncheck out the docs\n to explore all the key concepts, but fundamentally Bunni v2 is designed from the ground up to optimize profits for liquidity providers (LPs). \nSome of the main pillars it achieves this optimization through include:\n🪸 \nShapeshifting Liquidity\n — Liquidity positions can automatically adjust based on market conditions, reducing the need for active management.\n🌊 \nLiquidity Density Functions (LDFs)\n — A new framework for liquidity distribution that allows precise control over how liquidity is allocated across price ranges.\n🤖 \nAutonomous Rebalancing\n — Built-in automation ensures liquidity pools maintain optimal token ratios without relying on external bots or keepers.\n💰 \nRehypothecation\n — Idle liquidity isn’t wasted, pool creators have the option to deposit liquidity into yield-generating vaults to earn additional returns.\n🔄 \nOptimized Swap Fees\n — Bunni uses volatility-based dynamic fees and an auction-managed AMM to maximize fee revenue while maintaining competitive pricing.\nThanks to these innovations, LPs now have a great resource in Bunni when it comes to maximizing capital efficiency, minimizing impermanent loss, and automating position adjustments with ease. \nBut let's say you're an absolute newcomer here. Where should you begin? I recommend adding some liquidity or creating a new pool to get your bearings. \nTo give you some context, let's walk through the basics of doing so on \n \nBase\n 👇\nHow to Add Liquidity on Bunni and Base\nGo to \nbunni.xyz/dashboard/positions/base\n and connect your wallet\nPress the \"Add Liquidity\" button\nSurf the available liquidity pools and click on your desired trading pair or press the \"New pool\" button\nIf you click on an existing pair, use the provided \"Deposit\" interface to select how much liquidity you want to provide, then press \"Add Liquidity\"\nTo finish up, press \"Deposit\" and sign the final transaction prompts with your wallet — now you'll be providing liquidity on Bunni\nIf you opt instead for the \"New pool\" option, you'll next be asked to select from an Easy Mode, Standard Mode, and Advanced Mode — if you're just looking to get your feet wet, Easy Mode is perfectly fine here\nAt this point, input your desired token pair and the pool initialization price, then input a Pool name, symbol, and description, then press \"Next\"\nNow select from the available pool style presets: Low Risk Stable Pair (for stablecoins), Volatile Pair (for regular coins), or Uniswap V2 (if you want to provide full-range liquidity)\nLastly, you'll be asked if you want to enable ETH Rehypothecation; if you activate this mechanism, \"idle liquidity will be deposited into a vault to earn extra yield for liquidity providers\"\nPress \"Create Pool\" and complete the creation transactions with your wallet, and voila, you've set up your own Bunni pool!\nHow to Launch Better Memecoins on Flaunch on Bankless\nThe new memecoin launcher taps Uniswap v4 to enable fairer types of fair launches.\nBankless\nWilliam M.

The absence of clear guidance has left financial institutions hesitant to act, leading to a mass debanking across the crypto industry. If regulators are serious about fostering responsible innovation, they need to establish explicit, workable policies that allow crypto companies to operate within the system rather than being pushed out of it.",

The firm first \nsignaled\n its intentions to go public over four years ago in January 2021.\nFollowing the disastrous implosion of FTX, Gemini was forced to halt withdrawals from its “Earn” program, which had extended loans to the bankrupt exchange through a third-party lender called Genesis. Gemini later \nsettled\n for $50M over the matter with the State of New York, and was fortuitously able to return 100% of funds owed to depositors.\nWhile the subsequent onset of crypto’s bear market caused valuations to collapse and forced Gemini to shelve its IPO ambitions, recent Bloomberg \nreporting\n indicates that the Winklevi are considering a 2025 IPO. \nGemini’s sole external raise – announced in November 2021 – \nsecured\n $400M in funding at a $7.1B valuation.\nGemini, the cryptocurrency firm backed by the billionaire Winklevoss twins, is considering an IPO as soon as this year \nhttps://t.co/rP8KEiOLTl\n— Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) \nFebruary 6, 2025\n\n\n🔵 Circle\nWebsite\n | \nTwitter\nNo list of crypto’s top IPO contenders would be complete without Circle. The company ranks as the largest \naudited \nstablecoin issuer, and its $56B of dollar-pegged assets inundate every major blockchain in existence!\n \nCircle\n \nterminated\n plans to go public via \nSPAC\n merger with Concord Acquisition Corp in December 2022, but \ndisclosed\n in January 2024 that it had \"confidentially\" filed for a U.S. initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Subject to \"market and other conditions,\" the firm’s IPO can take place at any time once the SEC completes its registration review process.\nLast September, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire \nunveiled\n plans to migrate company headquarters to the heart of New York City’s financial district with an office that will occupy the entire 87th floor of the iconic One World Trade Center.\nCircle has raised approximately $1.5B across multiple funding rounds since inception in 2013 and was previously \nvalued\n at $9B before its abandoned SPAC merger.\n👀 \n@circle\n CEO Jeremy Allaire confirms plans to IPO \npic.twitter.com/Yynxkpzmwk\n— CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) \nJanuary 22, 2025\n\n\n 🦑 Kraken\nWebsite\n | \nTwitter\nShortly after competitive crypto exchange Coinbase’s highly successful stock market debut at a $47B valuation in April 2021, \n \nKraken\n CEO Jesse Powell \nannounced\n plans to take his exchange public during the second half of 2022.\nAlthough the firm’s IPO ambitions appeared to fizzle out after Powell resigned from his post in September 2022, Bloomberg \nreported\n last June that Kraken was seeking to raise $100M through a pre-IPO round and confirmed last month that it had \nreceived\n $27M in primary capital from the offering.\nKraken has conducted over 20 separate fundraising rounds and was \nrumored\n to have been valued at $20B during its Series D raise conducted near the crypto market peak in 2021.\n🔥 LATEST: Crypto exchange Kraken reported $1.5 billion in revenue for 2024, more than doubling from the previous year’s $671 million. \nThe company, eyeing a potential IPO, ended the year with 2.6 million funded accounts and $42.8 billion in assets held on its platform. \npic.twitter.com/6AImrt4o1R\n— Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) \nJanuary 31, 2025\n\n\n🪙\n Digital Currency Group\nWebsite\n | \nTwitter\nDigital Currency Group is one of the oldest crypto-focused venture conglomerates in existence and has been an integral component of crypto capital markets since their nascency!\nDCG held exposure in over 160 portfolio companies as of early 2023, but was forced to divest from some of these holdings – including all interest in crypto publisher CoinDesk – to raise cash for bad FTX loans made through lending subsidiary Genesis.

Mexico and Canada both responded by implementing tariffs on goods imported from the U.S., but Trump later agreed to 30-day pause on any action. The damage was already done in crypto – prices dropped across the board, with \n \nBitcoin\n falling as low as $92K and \n \nEthereum\n taking a drastic dive, wicking down just above $2.1K.\n25% tariffs on Canada & Mexico would cause lower GDP & higher inflation than otherwise in all three countries, including the US—& these estimates do not include retaliation. \nLearn more: \nhttps://t.co/Shhw60Qi1B\n \npic.twitter.com/3AmQRxIDLp\n— Peterson Institute (@PIIE) \nFebruary 3, 2025\n\n\n2️⃣ Trump Signs EO to Create Sovereign Wealth Fund\nOn Monday, Trump signed an executive order calling for the creation of a Sovereign Wealth Fund for the U.S.. While no official outline has been released on what will be invested in through the Sovereign Wealth Fund, the Secretary of the Treasury and Secretary of Commerce will allegedly put together a plan in the next 90 days for the formation of the fund. After signing the executive order, Trump hinted at big plans. \"We're going to be doing something, perhaps with TikTok,\" he told reporters.\nUS Sovereign Wealth Fund: \n\"We're going to monetize the asset side of the US balance sheet for the American people.

He was initially sentenced to 64 months in prison last year, but this week, a Dutch court opted to release him temporarily ahead of his appeal on the condition that he would be electronically monitored. While Pertsev leaving prison sets him up to prepare his appeal, the fight is far from over.\nFreedom is priceless, but my freedom cost a lot of money. My house arrest was only possible thanks to the work of lawyers, who were paid from your donations. My fight is not over yet and for a final and confident victory I still need your help.

BERA, the gas token for Berachain is currently trading at a fully diluted value of $3.2 billion. The Berachain Foundation airdropped around 15% of the total token supply to the community, while around 50% of the token supply is allocated to core contributors and investors.

Knowing how to apply liquidity effectively can make the difference between profits and losses. \nIn this article, we’ll explore three advanced LP strategies that help LPs navigate different market conditions:\nThe Anti-Sawtooth Strategy\n: designed for volatile assets that tend to mean-revert.\nThe Hot Potato Strategy\n: focused on maximizing fees during short-term trading spikes.\nThe Ole Bread 'n Butter Strategy\n: a market-adaptive approach to reducing impermanent loss.\np.s. Before diving too deep into these strategies, I recommend checking out these \nDLMM\n and \nDLMM Multiday\n guides. Do your homework before going degen, and remember, if you’d like less risk putting your tokens to work you can always park your USDC on \n \nCoinbase\n for ~4% APY. \nWith that said, let's get to it! 👇\n1️⃣ The Anti-Sawtooth \nStrategy\nOne of the biggest problems you will face LPing is impermanent loss from choppy, sawtooth price movements. The Anti-Sawtooth Strategy is designed to counteract this by setting liquidity in tight price ranges and frequently rebalancing positions.\nThis strategy is useful for assets that experience frequent but limited price swings, (seemingly every token these days) and often see high volatility despite generally returning to a consistent value over time.\nImplementation:\nIdentify an asset’s historical trading range. Look for assets that bounce within a band but don’t trend too aggressively in one direction.\nSet liquidity in a narrow range. Utilize Meteora’s concentrated liquidity tools to place liquidity closer to the mid-price, ensuring higher fee collection.\nRebalance when the price moves outside the range. Instead of holding and suffering impermanent loss, exit and re-enter liquidity positions as needed.\nAutomate with Meteora’s liquidity tools. This reduces manual effort and ensures precision in execution.\n2️⃣ The Hot Potato Strategy\nThis strategy is designed for short-term fee farming in pools that experience temporary liquidity surges. The goal is to jump into pools when they’re seeing high trading volume and exit before volume normalizes. It works best for meme coins, airdrop farms, and hype-driven assets, where fees temporarily spike before interest fades.\nImplementation:\nMonitor high-volume pools using something like gmgn.ai or dexscreener. Look for sudden TVL inflows and rising trade volume.\nDeploy liquidity during peak volume periods. This ensures higher fee collection per trade.\nExit before liquidity stabilizes. The goal is to avoid prolonged exposure to impermanent loss while capturing short-term gains.\nCycle funds through multiple pools to maximize efficiency.\n⚠️ This can be a dangerous strategy as the hot potato gets passed around quite quickly. Be prepared to cut your losses and leave a pool if it seems the hot potato has been passed to the next token.\n3️⃣ \nThe Ole Bread 'n Butter Strategy\nThis Strategy is a conservative approach that involves setting a wide liquidity range, typically up to -74% from the current price, using single-sided positions. This method allows for continuous fee-earning while minimizing the need for constant monitoring.\nImplementation:\nEstablish a liquidity range that extends below the current price in case of a large decline.\nProvide liquidity using only one asset, like SOL or USDC, to reduce initial exposure to volatile tokens.\nChoose bin steps (somewhere in the 100-200 bin range typically works) that allow for some fluctuations in price.\nPick a token you believe will range and then continue its upward trend, allowing you to buy the token at a cheaper price and capture fees along the way.\nWhile less demanding than other strategies, you should still monitor it occasionally and see if prices have swung!\n⚠️ Tips to Not Get Rekt\nChoosing the right token to DLMM is of the utmost importance, most of the time it’s even more important than the pool you choose. Knowing that, here are a few criteria I've often seen recommended by \n \nMeteora\n power users:\nAt least $2K volume moving average on 1-minute candles, preferably $4K.\nRegular swaps in the pools: no more than ~20 minutes between.\nMigration from a site like \n \npump.fun\n at least 6 hours ago – prefer 8 or more.\nAt least $2M market cap.\nAs always, none of the content in this post is financial advice, do your own research! Be careful and no your limits and how much you can afford to lose!\nConclusion\nDLMMs on Meteora provide LPs with versatile strategies to navigate various market conditions. The \nAnti-Sawtooth Strategy\n is ideal for volatile, mean-reverting assets, focusing on tight price ranges. The \nHot Potato Strategy\n suits short-term liquidity surges, aiming for quick fee collection. The \nBread 'n Butter Strategy\n offers a unique approach to spot buying, ensuring you collect fees while also buying spot.\nBy understanding and implementing these strategies, you can position yourself to capture fees, upside, protect yourself from the downside, and maybe make yourself eligible for an airdrop along the way. \nAs always, you can get rekt, so be careful, don’t put in more than you’re willing to lose, and ask questions in the Bankless Discord if you’re stuck.\n👀 \nBONUS:\n Bankless just made Meteora’s Airdrop Hunt in the Airdrop Hunter free for everyone. \nStart hunting\n.",

By increasing the staking limit, the network aims to streamline validator processes and improve scalability. This upgrade will also be a test for the EF which has faced scrutiny lately from community stakeholders, such as the VC firm \n \nParadigm\n who \nreleased\n an article saying they should release updates on a more frequent basis.",

While Trump’s team has aimed to distance itself from its own control over the TRUMP token, his public backing undoubtedly raises legal and ethical concerns.",

With the backing of President Trump's media company and partnerships with established financial institutions like Charles Schwab, this move could influence mainstream adoption of crypto-based financial products. It will undoubtedly also increase criticism among those who fear that Trump's personal businesses could create deep layers of conflicted interests, while perhaps also concerning those who have already bought into another ventures, that he is diluting his brand across too many fresh efforts.",

AI agents have begun to capture excitement as an emerging opportunity.\n Now, projects are being built out that will allow users to type in an action-oriented prompt and an AI agent will carry out the trade or swap in the background, pioneering a whole new sector of crypto called DeFAI (DeFi + AI). \nDon't ask us exactly how to pronounce it, but we can tell you why it's worth paying attention to!\nGetting Active Onchain \n🤖\nAI agents first appeared in the crypto space as simple Twitter accounts that were able to interact with humans and hold conversations. That evolved into them posting useful information based on on-chain data and what people were tweeting about.\nmy god i am feeling good\n— terminal of truths (@truth_terminal) \nJuly 4, 2024\n\n\nUsers then started to push the boundaries of these AI agents and wanted to test what other useful tasks these agents would be able to complete. We have now seen AI agents running funds, making music, and creating art. Teams have now started building applications that utilize these AI agents to assist in almost anything crypto-related and may start becoming an alternative to traditional hot wallets due to their convenience and the ability to manage your funds.\nStreamlining the Experience 🌅\nWhen newbie users want to interact with a DeFi application, even basic tasks like lending out ETH can be tricky. \nSimply navigating these projects and ensuring your funds are going to the intended place can be confusing. Meanwhile, having to go back and forth between networks trying to zero-in on top yield opps for a single token can be downright annoying.\nThe best APY, the right trade, the next big move—what if you didn’t have to search for it? Orbit automates the hunt, optimize your strategy, and execute in real time.\n— Orbit (@orbitcryptoai) \nFebruary 4, 2025\n\n\nWith DeFAI projects like \nOrbit\n, this can all be accomplished with just a simple prompt! Users simply ask the agent “Can you deposit some ETH into \n \nAave\n for highest yield on any network?” and the agent will be able to bridge your ETH if needed to the correct network to deposit your funds without you having to search for it. Orbit offers a variety of \nprotocol-specialized agents\n that new users can interact with and browse what all these different agents offer. They can also just type into the Orbit agent a prompt like “Where can I deposit my USDC to earn yield?”, which Orbit will return a list of protocols that users can deposit their USDC into.\nCarrying the Boats 🛶\nNot only are these DeFAI projects able to assist in completing actions onchain, but they can also help out with heavy lifting on the research side. For many veteran users, scrolling through docs, white papers, and GitHub repositories are a necessary tasks before touching any project at all. \nDeFAI teams, like Clustr Labs, are creating AI agents to scrape through project documentation and give an output on the most relevant and important information, saving users hours of research. \nAutonomous DeFAI research just got smarter!\nOur latest PoC showcases an AI agent that autonomously crawls project documentation, ranks relevance via content embeddings, and feeds top insights to o3-mini for instant reasoning.\nInvestors & researchers who build agents with Clustr… \npic.twitter.com/obUGQJ0fXT\n— Clustr Labs (@Clustr_Labs) \nFebruary 3, 2025\n\n\nCleaning Up Crypto 🧼\nAn additional issue that these DeFAI platforms are solving for is reducing the sheer number of scams that occur in the space. \nThat may sound like a tall order, but if you have spent any time on CT, you have seen a multitude of accounts trying to impersonate accounts with malicious links. These DeFAI projects will be able to determine and whitelist certain projects to which their AI agents have access. This will ensure that users are interacting with projects that don't have malicious intents and have their funds stolen from just signing one wrong transaction.\nTop Projects? 💸\nWhile DeFAI projects are still in their early stages, they are laying the groundwork for the DeFi space as a whole. These AI agents are capable of improving every user's workflow, no matter how experienced you are. So don't be surprised when you start seeing DeFi projects building out their own AI agents and integrating them for everyday use on their platform. \nInterested in taking a look at more top early projects in this space? \nCheck out our recent Citizen-gated article!\nDeFAI: Top Projects Tackling AI Agents + DeFi on Bankless\nUnpacking the latest buzzy sector in the fast-evolving crypto AI agent space.\nBankless\nKazu Umemoto Jan 10, 2025 • 4 min read",
