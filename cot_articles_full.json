AI agents need access to sensitive data to be useful, but today’s infrastructure forces users to choose between privacy and utility.\nBlind Compute changes that. Nillion enables computation on encrypted data without ever exposing it—solving AI’s trust problem.\nThe Nillion network architecture consists of two key components, each with a distinct and vital role: Coordination Layer (nilChain) & Petnet (Privacy Enhancing Technology Network)\nMulti-layered privacy. Instead of relying on a single approach, Nillion orchestrates MPC, FHE, ZKPs, and TEEs into a seamless privacy stack.\nA stacked team with serious backing, including Uber’s founding engineer and cryptography veterans, with $50M raised from top-tier investors.\nNIL’s token economics is designed for adoption. NIL will power the network, securing operations while driving burn-based demand as usage scales.\n\nWe’ve been dreaming about personal AI assistants for decades.\n\nFrom Iron Man’s JARVIS managing every aspect of Tony Stark’s life (and saving it occasionally), to Star Trek’s Computer knowing exactly how hot Picard likes his Earl Grey (always hot), to Her’s Samantha—who not only organizes Theodore’s inbox but also philosophizes about existence while falling in love.\n\nFrom the movie Her (2013)\n\n‍\n\nThey’re reflections of a shared truth: being human is exhausting.\n\nJARVIS doesn’t just operate Tony Stark’s suit. He schedules meetings, orders groceries, pays bills, and probably suggests that another 3 AM tinkering session isn’t the healthiest idea.\n\nWhen we see that, we think: Yes. That. I need that.\n\nWe keep inventing these fictional assistants because, deep down, we all crave one. Someone—or something—that lifts the relentless mental load of modern life.\n\nAn assistant who remembers what we forget, spots patterns we miss, and maybe, just maybe, saves us from sending that 2 AM text we’ll 100% regret the next day.\n\nThe Privacy Problem\n\nBut here's where reality hits different than fiction: JARVIS knew everything about Tony Stark because, well, it was a movie.\n\nThe movie never had to confront the privacy nightmare of an AI having complete access to every corner of someone’s life.\n\nIn the real world? That’s a trillion-dollar challenge waiting for a solution.\n\nRight now, AI agents are still toddlers in their development—shitposting on Twitter, creating anime avatars, and cracking a few jokes. But this is changing fast. We’re on the edge of something much bigger.\n\nTo genuinely help us, these AI agents need access to our most sensitive information.\n\nThink about what JARVIS actually knew about Tony:\n\nComplete financial picture- every account, every investment, every secret project\nPersonal relationships- from conversations with his wife, Pepper Potts, to the Avengers to his enemies\nHealth data- full biometrics, medical history, that shrapnel near his heart\nProfessional secrets- not just Iron Man suits, but all of Stark Industries' IP\n\nNow imagine handing over that level of access to an AI agent today. Would you be comfortable with it? This isn’t some hypothetical wishlist—it’s the type of data AI needs to truly become our digital representative.\n\nAn AI financial advisor that doesn’t know your full financial picture is just a glorified calculator.\n\nAn AI health assistant without your complete medical history? WebMD with better UI.\n\nFor AI to cross from novelty to necessity, we have to solve the privacy puzzle.\n\nThe Impossible Choice\n\nToday’s AI infrastructure generally forces us into a dilemma:\n\n1. Give Up Privacy for Utility\n\nSurrender all your data to centralized AI companies\nTrust they’ll keep it safe (cross your fingers)\nAccept that your data might be used for training models\n\n2. Keep Privacy but Sacrifice Utility\n\nStick to local, limited AI models\nMiss out on advanced features\nSettle for mediocre performance\n\nTake the example of an AI health assistant for cancer patients.\n\nTo provide meaningful support, it needs access to your complete medical history, genetic test results, current treatment plans, medication schedules, side effect reports, and even your private conversations about how you're really feeling.\n\nWithout robust privacy guarantees, you're essentially broadcasting your most intimate health struggles to unknown servers and employees.\n\nImagine your most vulnerable moments—your fears, your pain, your treatment decisions—processed in the clear on a company’s infrastructure.\n\nThe real issue is how AI systems handle data.\n\nWhen you use tools like ChatGPT or Claude, here’s what happens:\n\nYour data gets sent to their servers → processed in the clear → and potentially stored for future model training.\n\nYes, they have privacy policies and security measures. But at the end of the day, you’re still relying on trust.\n\nThat might have been fine when AI was just writing emails or generating cute cat images. But as AI gets more personal—and more powerful—this privacy crisis becomes existential.\n\nThe Need for a New Paradigm\n\nThe solution isn’t just better encryption or stricter privacy policies. That’s like putting locks on a house with no walls.\n\nWe need a fundamental reimagining of how AI systems handle sensitive data. We need infrastructure that:\n\nEnables computation on encrypted data without exposing it\nProvides cryptographic privacy guarantees\nDecentralizes trust so no single entity holds all the power\n\nThe next wave of AI won’t just be about smarter models or faster performance. It will be about trust.\n\nCan we build systems that are powerful enough to handle our most sensitive data and trustworthy enough for us to share it?\n\nCan we create the privacy infrastructure to make a real-life JARVIS possible?\n\nThese questions will define the next chapter of AI development.\n\nAnd that’s where Nillion’s story begins.\n\nNillion = Blind Compute\n\nNillion is creating an entirely new paradigm called \"Blind Compute.\"\n\nWith this, you could have all the power of advanced AI systems without ever exposing your sensitive data. Not just encrypting storage, but actual computation on encrypted data that remains private from end to end—even from the infrastructure processing it.\n\nBut to understand why this is revolutionary, we need to understand where current privacy solutions fall short.\n\nBeyond Traditional Privacy\n\nMany existing privacy solutions are like locking your data in a vault—it’s secure at rest, but the moment you want to use it, you have to take it out.\n\nEvery time you compute something, you expose the data. It’s like carrying sensitive documents through a crowded street every time you need to work with them.\n\nThis “decrypt-compute-encrypt” process creates windows of vulnerability that sophisticated attackers can exploit. Even with strong encryption, your data is exposed during computation, making it susceptible to memory scraping, side-channel attacks, and other exploits.\n\nNillion’s Blind Compute enables computation while data remains encrypted.\n\nThe Power of Orchestration\n\nThe current privacy protocol landscape is fragmented and specialized. There’s no shortage of solutions but each comes with its own limitations:\n\nMulti-Party Computation (MPC) excels at secure distributed computation but struggles to scale.\nFully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables computation on encrypted data but is slow and expensive.\nZero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) offer powerful verification without data exposure but are limited by compute capacity and bandwidth\nTrusted Execution Environments (TEE) provide practical security but require hardware trust assumptions.\n\nMost projects choose one approach and optimize around its strengths while accepting its limitations. It’s like choosing a single instrument and trying to perform an entire symphony.\n\nNillion doesn’t settle for a solo performance. It conducts a full orchestra.\n\nTogether, these Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) harmonize to create a privacy solution greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nLet’s break it down and explore how Nillion achieves this, technically.\n\nUnder The Hood— Network Architecture\n\nThe Nillion network architecture consists of two key components, each with a distinct and vital role:\n\nCoordination Layer (nilChain)\nPetnet (Privacy Enhancing Technology Network)\n\nTogether, they enable Blind Computation.\n\n#1 — The Coordination Layer\n\nBuilt on Cosmos SDK, the Coordination Layer, called nilChain, acts as the network’s control center. It doesn’t process private data or run computations. Instead, it ensures the network functions efficiently and securely, much like a high-performance operating system managing processes and resource allocation.\n\nWhy Cosmos SDK?\n\nThe choice of going with Cosmos SDK makes sense because of its modular architecture, high scalability, and interoperability. Cosmos is designed for sovereignty, allowing nilChain to operate independently while still benefiting from cross-chain compatibility through Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC).\n\nIn practical terms, this means Nillion can interact with other blockchain ecosystems securely and efficiently without relying on traditional bridges, which are often security risks.\n\nWhat nilChain Does\n\nDespite being built on Cosmos, nilChain is intentionally lightweight. It doesn’t store or process any sensitive data. Instead, it focuses on:\n\nPayment Processing – Each time someone uses Nillion’s compute services, nilChain handles the economic logic—like a decentralized billing system.\nRewards & Staking – Node operators stake tokens to participate; in return, they receive fees for honest work. Malicious nodes risk losing their stake.\nNetwork Security – nilChain also keeps a global ledger of node stakes, reputations, and tasks.\nOrchestration – nilChain coordinates which clusters of nodes handle specific computations, ensuring load balancing and matching tasks to nodes with the right capabilities (e.g., a cluster specialized in large-scale MPC).\n\nThis minimalist approach is crucial because it allows the Coordination Layer to focus entirely on orchestration while leaving the complex privacy-preserving computation to the Petnet.\n\nAs of now, nilChain is running in a testnet environment, with the mainnet expected to go live this month.\n\n#2 — The Petnet\n\nWhile the Coordination Layer manages the network's operations, the Petnet (Privacy Enhancing Technology Network) is where Nillion's real magic happens.\n\nThis is a network of specialized privacy processors, each contributing to a larger system that can compute on encrypted data without ever seeing the actual information.\n\nPetnet combines different privacy technologies through a system of specialized clusters. Instead of forcing every node to handle every type of computation, nodes are grouped into clusters that specialize in specific tasks.\n\nThe Cluster Architecture: Specialization at Scale\n\nThis clustering approach solves a fundamental challenge in privacy-preserving computation: balancing security and performance.\n\nSome computations need maximum security and can tolerate slower speeds, while others require lightning-fast processing for real-time applications. By letting clusters specialize, Nillion achieves both without compromise.\n\nThink of these clusters as specialized departments in a company. Just as you wouldn't want your accounting team handling product design, you don't want every node trying to handle every type of computation. Some clusters might focus on:\n\nMaximum security for highly sensitive data\nReal-time processing for time-critical applications\nOptimal performance for specific types of calculations\nSo What Are These Privacy Technologies?\n\nThe Petnet combines three cutting-edge Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to deliver next-level security and efficiency.\n\n1. Multi-Party Computation (MPC)\n\nMPC enables multiple parties to jointly compute a function while keeping their individual inputs private. Nillion’s custom MPC protocol is designed to eliminate the traditional communication overhead that makes classic MPC slow.\n\nHow It Works – Instead of one entity handling sensitive data, multiple nodes hold pieces of encrypted information (called “particles”). Each node processes only its share of the data, ensuring no single entity can reconstruct the original input.\nSecret Sharing & Blinding – Private input data is split into encrypted shares using Shamir’s Secret Sharing and one-time masking, which prevents unauthorized access.\nLocal Computation Without Interaction – Nodes compute independently without communicating with each other, preventing data leaks during the process.\nReconstruction & Verification – Once the computation is complete, nodes combine their result shares to reconstruct the final output, ensuring correctness without exposing sensitive inputs.\n\nBy eliminating communication during computation, Nillion’s MPC achieves speed and scalability that were previously considered impractical.\n\n2. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)\n\nFully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. While FHE is computationally expensive, Nillion selectively integrates FHE where it provides the most value.\n\nWhy FHE? – Unlike MPC, which splits data among nodes, FHE enables direct computation on encrypted data without the need for secret-sharing.\nFHE as a Complementary Module – Nillion uses FHE for cases where secret sharing isn’t feasible, such as computations on financial transactions that must remain encrypted end-to-end.\nHybrid MPC + FHE – In some instances, FHE is combined with MPC, allowing the system to encrypt data before it’s shared across nodes. This ensures data remains encrypted at every stage of processing.\n\nThe network also integrates preprocessing techniques to reduce the complexity of homomorphic operations, making FHE viable for practical deployments.\n\n3. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)\n\nTEEs provide hardware-based isolation for executing sensitive computations securely within a processor. Nillion leverages TEEs selectively via its nilTEE framework.\n\nHow TEEs Work – TEEs are secure areas within a processor that run code in isolation, preventing sensitive data from being exposed to the broader system.\nAI Model Execution – TEEs enable secure AI model inference without exposing model weights or input data.\nThreshold Signing & Authentication – Used for secure cryptographic signing and identity verification.\nShort-Lived Secure Computation – Nillion uses TEEs only for performance-critical tasks, ensuring that long-term data protection remains decentralized.\n\nBy integrating TEEs with MPC and FHE, Nillion achieves a balance between performance, security, and decentralization, ensuring that computations remain private while delivering high-speed results.\n\n(We wrote more about on TEEs in our essay on Atoma Network)\n\nMaking Privacy Practical: The Developer Stack\n\nAll this sophisticated privacy tech would be useless if developers couldn’t easily work with it.\n\nThis is why Nillion has created a suite of developer tools that abstract away the complexity of privacy-preserving computation.\n\nHere's what the toolkit currently includes:\n\nnilVM:\n\nA privacy-first virtual machine that transforms how developers write secure applications.\n\nUsing a Python-based language called Nada, developers can write code that feels just like normal programming—but behind the scenes, it compiles into privacy-preserving operations. Think of it as a universal translator that converts regular instructions into secure multi-party computations without the developer needing to worry about cryptography.\n\nThe VM supports both basic operations and more complex tasks like threshold signing of messages, making it particularly valuable for financial applications that need to maintain privacy while processing sensitive data.\n\nThe module can be accessed with the SecretSigning SDK that leverages nilVM’s cryptographic functions for threshold signing and authentication workflows.\n\nnilDB:\n\nnilDB makes working with encrypted data as simple as using a regular database. Unlike traditional systems where data must be decrypted to query or analyze it, nilDB keeps everything encrypted while still allowing complex operations.\n\nIt uses a combination of secret sharing and MPC to split data across multiple nodes, ensuring no single node ever sees complete information.\n\nDevs can write familiar SQL-like queries, and nilDB automatically handles all the privacy-preserving operations in the background.\n\nThis makes it perfect for applications like healthcare systems that need to analyze patient data while maintaining strict privacy compliance, or financial services that need to detect fraud patterns without exposing individual transaction details.\n\nThe system even supports secure multi-party analytics, allowing organizations to gain insights from combined datasets without revealing their underlying data to each other. This can be accessed through these SDKs:\n\nSecretVault: A vault-like service for securely uploading and managing encrypted data.\nSecretDataAnalytics: Allows authorized queries or analytics on encrypted datasets without exposing the underlying information.\nnilAI:\n\nA suite of AI-focused privacy technologies that makes private machine learning practical. It comes with three key components:\n\nAIVM (AI Virtual Machine): Built on Nillion's MPC technology and integrated with Meta's CrypTen framework, it enables AI models to process data while keeping both the model and the data private.\nnada-AI: Provides a PyTorch-like interface that makes it easy for developers to work with privacy-preserving AI models. You can train neural networks, run inference, and handle machine learning tasks using familiar patterns.\nnilTEE: Uses Trusted Execution Environments for secure AI processing, particularly useful for running large language models privately.\n\nThe system accelerates encrypted AI operations using techniques like Discrete Wavelet Transform (co-researched with Meta's AI Research team). This makes it possible to run complex AI workloads with practical performance - from personalized AI assistants that keep user data private to enterprise AI systems that need to maintain data confidentiality while delivering real-time results.\n\nFrom Request to Result: The End-to-End Flow\n\nNow that we’ve seen how nilChain, the Petnet, and the Blind Modules fit together, let’s look at a typical user interaction—from storing data to running an AI model.\n\nHere’s the short version of what happens:\n\nUser Initiation\nA user or app interacts with Nillion’s SecretSDK or API (e.g., “store this file securely” or “run this function on my data”).\n\nClient-Side Preparation\nThe SDK encrypts or secret-shares the data so that no single party can view it in full. This might involve MPC shares or enclaving data for TEE processing.\n\nCoordination via nilChain\nThe request goes to nilChain, which logs it, handles payment in $NIL, and assigns the task to a specialized cluster in the Petnet. Different clusters may focus on storage (nilDB), computation (nilVM), or AI inference (nilAI).\n\nBlind Execution in Petnet\nnilDB (Storage): Data shares are distributed across the cluster’s nodes.\nnilVM (Computation): Nodes run an MPC protocol on their data shares—no single node sees the entire input.\nnilAI (AI Inference): TEEs or hybrid FHE/MPC approaches ensure even the node operator can’t see the raw data or model weights.\nDuring this phase, each cluster node processes only encrypted or masked data.\n\nResult & Settlement\n\nThe cluster finalizes the result (e.g., storing shares, returning a computation outcome, or sending an encrypted AI response).\nnilChain confirms completion, releases payments to participating nodes, and handles any slashing if nodes behaved maliciously. The user finally decrypts the result locally if needed.\n\nThis workflow delivers end-to-end privacy and verifiability, with nilChain orchestrating tasks and the Petnet executing them securely behind the scenes.\n\nThe Nillion Tech in Action\nNillion Blind Computation is shaping the future of privacy, not just for AI, but for all of tech.\n\nOur Head of Ecosystem, @0xlukeskywalker dives into our latest ecosystem update and what's coming next!\n\n— Nillion (@nillionnetwork)\n3:24 PM • Feb 15, 2025\n\nNillion's technology is already processing significant workloads and gaining serious developer traction. Thankfully, it’s not just theory.\n\nDeveloper adoption is rapidly growing, with the Nillion SDKs being downloaded externally 961 times in just two months — an early signal of the platform's emerging developer ecosystem.\n\nBy providing a foundation for privacy-preserving computation and storage, Nillion is unlocking entirely new categories of products and services across multiple sectors.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\nPrivate AI Agents\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the next wave of AI agents will need to handle increasingly sensitive data to be truly useful. Nillion's blind computation infrastructure enables AI agents to process private information without exposing it:\n\nSkillful AI has implemented private Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using nilVM, allowing users to leverage sensitive documents while minimizing data exposure during inference\nRainfall built a self-sovereign AI platform focused on collective social intelligence while protecting user privacy through secure weight aggregation\nVerida is developing a personalized AI chatbot trained on sensitive user messages, using nilDB for secure storage\n\nThis shift from entertainment-focused AI agents to utility-focused ones often requires bulletproof privacy guarantees that only blind computation can provide. As AI agents evolve to handle investments, governance, and negotiations, Nillion's infrastructure becomes essential.\n\nHealthcare Applications\n\nHealthcare is another massive opportunity for blind computation, with the AI healthcare data market projected to grow by 524% from $32.3 billion to $208.2 billion between 2024 and 2030.\n\nSecure Research Collaboration: Healthcare institutions can analyze patient data across regions without exposing sensitive information\nPrivacy-Preserving Diagnostics: AI-based diagnostic tools can process patient data while maintaining complete confidentiality\nCompliant Data Sharing: Enables collaboration while meeting strict healthcare privacy regulations\n\nHealthBlocks demonstrates this potential, allowing users to collect data from different sources while maintaining ownership and control, then using Nillion to generate insights for third parties without leaking specific details.\n\nDeFi & Sensitive Data\n\nCurrently, DeFi’s transparency exposes traders to MEV attacks, front-running, and market manipulation.\n\nKayra, a decentralized dark pool DEX, solves this by using Nillion’s blind computation for private, institution-grade trading.\n\nStealth Order Book: Orders are encrypted and processed privately, preventing market impact.\nBlind Computation Matching (nilVM): Orders are submitted in encrypted form and processed using Nillion’s MPC nodes. Each node computes on fragments of the data without ever seeing the full order, ensuring confidentiality. When a match is found, only the final trade details are decrypted for settlement, preventing leaks at every stage.\nMEV & Front-Running Protection: Orders remain private until execution, ensuring fair pricing.\n\nUsing Nillion, Kayra offers trustless privacy, making DeFi viable for institutions and large traders. If successful, it could be game-changing for private trading on-chain.\n\nOther apps using Nillion for DeFi include:\n\nChooseK is developing an order book platform enabling private DeFi products\nKagami created a trading policy engine in nilVM for encrypted financial policies\n\nWith the World Economic Forum estimating $867 trillion potentially flowing into DeFi, privacy-preserving infrastructure becomes critical for institutional adoption.\n\nBlockchain Integrations\n\nNillion has also established strategic partnerships with major blockchain platforms to make blind computation accessible across these chains:\n\nArbitrum: Enhanced privacy tools for Ethereum scaling\nNEAR Protocol: Privacy-preserving application development\nAptos: Infrastructure for privacy-focused apps\nSei: Native integration for secure computation\n\nThese integrations allow smart contracts and users to leverage blind computations directly from their preferred chains using native gas tokens- no new wallets required.\n\nKey Partnerships Driving Adoption\n\nTech is meaningless if no one uses it.\n\nStrategic partnerships are accelerating Nillion's adoption across multiple sectors, with major collaborations that showcase the platform's versatility and potential.\n\nThe collaboration with Meta’s AI Research team has led to breakthrough advancements in privacy-preserving AI computation, while partnerships with Virtuals Protocol for AI agent co-ownership and Ritual for decentralized AI inference demonstrate Nillion’s ability to push boundaries in emerging fields.\n\nCombined with their strong technical foundations and growing ecosystem adoption, these strategic alignments position Nillion to capture significant value as privacy-preserving computation becomes essential infrastructure.\n\nNIL Tokenomics\n\nThe NIL token sits at the heart of Nillion's blind compute network, serving as both the network's utility token and governance mechanism.\n\nWith a total supply of 1 billion tokens, NIL is designed to align incentives across all network participants while enabling sustainable growth of the ecosystem.\n\nNote: NIL is not live yet at time of writing\n\nSupply-Side: Allocation & Unlocks\nToken Allocation\n\nA large chunk of the token supply (45%) is going towards community and R&D to keep improving the tech, showing a focus on sustainable growth rather than short-term gains.\n\nThe protocol has also reserved 7.5% of the total supply (75 million NIL) for a genesis airdrop to early supporters and builders, targeting those who've made meaningful contributions to the network's development.\n\nUnlock Schedule\n\nThe token release will follow a measured unlock schedule:\n\nInitial circulating supply of ~13.9% (139.6M tokens)\nMajor unlock events begins 6 months after the genesis, bringing supply to ~30%\nGradual increase to ~48% by the 12th month post-TGE\nLong-term linear vesting for team and ecosystem allocations\n\nThe schedule is fairly aggressive in the 1st year: after six months of no new tokens, supply jumps from about 14% to over 30%, then climbs to nearly 48% by the 12th month. Since most of these first-year unlocks come from investor and team allocations (always a bit controversial on CT…), it’s crucial for the team and community to drive strong network usage and create enough token demand to absorb the increased supply.\n\nDemand-Side: Utility & Governance\n\nNIL plays a central role in securing the network and providing access to its services:\n\nNetwork Access\nCompute & Storage Operations: In the initial stage, users burn NIL tokens based on dollar-denominated credits system. All payments for Petnet operations are currently 100% burned.\nModule-Specific Pricing:\nnilVM: Flat-rate burning for compute/storage operations, with option to pre-burn tokens for Credits on specific clusters to reduce latency\nnilDB & nilAI: Subscription-based model requiring monthly NIL burns for API access\nPredictable Costs: Operations are priced in dollar-denominated, non-transferable Credits to ensure cost stability for enterprises\nNode Staking\nValidators & Petnet Clusters: Node operators stake NIL to secure their roles and can face slashing for malicious behavior. As NIL’s value grows, the network theoretically becomes more secure through higher economic penalties for wrongdoing.\nGovernance & Resource Allocation\nProposal & Voting: NIL holders influence protocol upgrades, fee structures, and ecosystem funding.\nResource Deployment: Governance sets parameters on how community resources are allocated.\nHow It All Comes Together: Supply vs. Demand\n\nIn the early stages, 100% of all Petnet operation fees are burned, creating a significant token sink as network usage grows.\n\nOperational fees are set through governance decisions, with plans to transition to a permissionless, cluster-based pricing model in the future.\n\nThis combination of predictable, dollar-denominated costs and complete token burns creates a clear and powerful connection between network adoption and token value. Exactly what we like to see in a token design.\n\nNillion’s tokenomics are built for the long game. The system is designed to thrive as network adoption scales, relying on three key drivers of sustainability:\n\nUsage → Value: As network activity grows, more tokens are burned, driving NIL’s price higher.\nStaking → Security: A rising token value incentivizes node operators to stake more tokens, increasing the network’s security and resilience.\nGovernance → Alignment: Token holders have a direct role in shaping network policy, ensuring that those with a vested interest guide its development and long-term success.\n\nIf the network captures even a fraction of the $270 billion cloud computation and storage market, token burns from network usage could quickly outpace even the most aggressive unlock schedules—fueling long-term value creation for the NIL token.\n\nTeam & Fundraising\n\nI love peeking startup origin stories.\n\nNillion has assembled a truly world-class team that combines deep expertise across cryptography, distributed systems, and product development.\n\nThe leadership team brings together accomplished veterans from both Web2 and Web3:\n\nAlex Page (CEO) comes from a traditional finance background, having worked as a General Partner at Hedera SPV and as a banker at Goldman Sachs.\nAndrew Masanto (CSO) is a serial entrepreneur with multiple exists, and brings valuable ecosystem-building experience as the previous co-Founder of Hedera and Founding CMO of Reserve.\n\nThe technical foundation is anchored by several key leaders:\n\nDr. Miguel de Vega serves as Chief Scientist, bringing deep cryptographic expertise with 30 patents in data optimization. His research background is crucial for Nillion's novel approaches to privacy-enhancing technologies.\nConrad Whelan, as founding CTO, leverages his experience as a founding Engineer at Uber to build scalable distributed systems. His track record of architecting systems that serve millions of users is particularly relevant as Nillion aims to become core infrastructure.\nDated: May 12, 2022. Source: Medium\n\n‍\n\nSee what Conrad posted on his medium page, almost 3 years ago. 👀\n\nBottom line? We can tell that the team is pretty stacked and have been building for many years, together. All signs point to big things ahead.\n\nOn the funding front, Nillion has secured substantial backing to execute on its vision.\n\nThey have raised $50 million across several funding rounds from prominent crypto investors, including:\n\nHack VC\nHashkey Capital\nDistributed Global\nMaelstrom\n\nWith a seasoned team and securing significant financial backing, Nillion is primed to tackle the complex (and ambitious) challenge of building privacy-preserving computation infrastructure.\n\nOur Thoughts\n1. Orchestration is the Real Moat\n\nNillion's approach is to focus on orchestrating multiple privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) rather than betting everything on a single approach. This strategy is smart for two key reasons:\n\nFirst, it creates optionality. Different use cases have different privacy requirements and trade-offs. Some prioritize speed over maximum security, while others need regulatory compliance or specific encryption standards. By orchestrating multiple PETs, Nillion can offer the right tool for each job rather than forcing everything through a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nSecond, it future-proofs the platform. As new privacy technologies emerge (and they will), Nillion can integrate them into their orchestration layer without disrupting existing applications. This adaptability will be crucial as advances in quantum computing push today’s privacy techniques to evolve.\n\nOf course, building an effective orchestration layer isn’t easy. The challenge lies in making it seamless for developers. If the experience is overly complex or clunky, there’s a real risk that Nillion’s powerful solution could end up being theoretically impressive but practically unusable.\n\n2. Privacy as Infrastructure, Not a Feature\n\nYour key takeaway from reading this essay should be that that Nillion is positioning privacy as fundamental infrastructure for the next generation of computing.\n\nThink about how SSL/TLS became the default for web communication. We no longer talk about “encrypted websites” because encryption is simply how the web works. Nillion’s bet is that blind computation will follow the same trajectory.\n\nAs AI agents become more integrated into our lives and take on increasingly sensitive tasks, privacy will not longer be optional—it will be a prerequisite. Just like how no serious business would launch a website without HTTPS today, future applications won’t be able to function without built-in privacy guarantees.\n\nTiming will be key. Enter too early, and the market might not yet feel the urgency. Enter too late, and centralized solutions could become entrenched.\n\nNillion’s success will depend on hitting the market at just the right moment—when privacy concerns become so acute that developers and enterprises start actively seeking solutions. If they can ride that wave, Nillion has a real shot at making privacy-preserving computation the default standard for next-gen applications.\n\nThe Privacy Renaissance\n\nNillion is tackling AI’s biggest hurdle: trust\n\nBy weaving together cutting-edge privacy tech into a seamless backbone for AI, Nillion has the potential to become as fundamental to AI as SSL is to the web. If Nillion can make it as easy to use as it is powerful, they’ll be powering the next wave of AI adoption.\n\nHigh stakes. Massive opportunity. The privacy revolution is just beginning.\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan & 0xAce\n\nUseful Links\nNillion website\nTestnet guide\nDeveloper Docs\nPrivate LLMs research paper with Meta \n\nChain of Thought received a grant from Nillion for this initiative.

The AI industry is confronting a new bottleneck: data. In particular, high-quality data—marked by accuracy, deep expertise, and contextual richness.\nPundi AI is decentralizing AI’s most critical layer: training data.\nUsing on-chain incentives, Pundi AI transforms data labeling and verification into a global, crowd-sourced effort that ensures high-quality data while rewarding contributors.\nThe Pundi AIFX Omni Layer solves scalability and interoperability challenges by connecting decentralized AI data across multiple blockchains.\nWith its Data Marketplace, Pundi AI aims to be the “OpenSea for AI data,” empowering developers to buy, sell, and license high-quality datasets.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2024, GPUs became the hottest commodity in tech. NVIDIA soared past a trillion-dollar valuation, fueled by an insatiable demand for AI compute. The equation seemed simple:\n\nMore compute = better AI.\n\nPour money into more GPUs, scale up training runs, and watch as AI models get smarter.\n\nAnd so, the industry has spent over $100 billion on NVIDIA hardware since GPT-4’s training run in late 2022. According to AI scaling laws, that level of investment should have delivered massive performance gains. Historically, doubling computing meant predictable improvements in AI capabilities.\n\nNVIDIA Revenue Spike after Q4 2022 (h/t @Thomas_Woodside)\n\n‍\n\nYet something strange happened.\n\nDespite the astronomical jump in compute, the gap between GPT-4 and its successors hasn’t widened as much as expected.\n\nOnce as reliable as Moore’s Law, the AI scaling “law” is bending, hinting that we may be reaching the limits of what raw computational power alone can achieve.\n\nIf throwing more GPUs at the problem isn’t unlocking the next leap forward, what is?\n\nThe Data Wall\n\nWe are entering an era where data, not compute, is the primary constraint on AI progress.\n\nAll the computing power in the world is useless without fresh, high-quality data to train models. And that’s where things are getting tricky.\n\nThe challenge is not about collecting more data—it’s about collecting better data.\n\nAI models are starved for training sets that meaningfully improve performance, but those datasets are hard to find, expensive to curate, and riddled with quality issues.\n\nWhat makes data high-quality?\nDeep domain expertise (e.g., medical, legal, scientific knowledge)\nStrict labeling standards (inconsistent data poisons models)\nMultiple layers of verification (fact-checking at scale is difficult)\nRich contextual metadata (AI needs more than just raw text)\nCoverage of edge cases (handling rare but critical scenarios)\n\nAnd here’s the problem: we may be running out of this data.\n\nOpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic are all experimenting with synthetic data generation—using AI to create training data for newer AI models. On paper, it sounds brilliant.\n\nSynthetic data could:\n\nReduce reliance on human-generated content, avoiding legal and ethical headaches.\n\nProduce massive, customisable datasets at a fraction of the cost.\n\nFill gaps where real-world data is scarce, like rare medical conditions or niche languages.\n\n\nBut there’s a major risk.\n\nWithout stringent quality control, synthetic data could trap AI in a feedback loop—a self-referential echo chamber where models learn from their own flawed outputs rather than fresh, high-fidelity human knowledge.\n\nLeft unchecked, this can lead to “AI inbreeding.” Small errors multiply with each iteration, quietly compounding until they cause a steady degradation in model performance. Worst case? Full-on model collapse (this is real, btw)\n\nThe Other Data Issue\n\nData is the new oil—but only a few companies own the refineries.\n\nThink about it – who has the most diverse, high-quality data today?\n\nOpenAI: Massive user interactions through ChatGPT and enterprise deals with media establishments\nGoogle: Search queries, YouTube content, and enterprise data\nMeta: Social interactions and content engagement\nMicrosoft: Enterprise workflows and developer behaviors\n\nThis centralization creates a troubling dynamic: the more data they collect, the better their models get. The better their models get, the more users they attract. More users generate even more data.\n\nThis self-reinforcing cycle means that AI breakthroughs—and the power that comes with them—are increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few.\n\nThe second-order effects are even more concerning. When a handful of companies control the data pipeline, they effectively control:\n\nWhich problems AI systems learn to solve\nWhat biases get baked into models\nHow AI capabilities evolve\nWho can build competitive AI systems\n\nThis is a societal problem. The data collection capabilities of a few Silicon Valley companies shouldn't dictate the future of AI.\n\nPundi AI: Decentralizing Training Data\n\nThis is where Pundi AI steps onto the stage with a bold proposition: decentralize the most pivotal element of the AI pipeline—training data.\n\nIn recent months, we’ve seen major strides in distributing the AI stack:\n\nCompute: Projects like IO, Aethir, and Atoma push GPU power to decentralized networks.\nModels: Bittensor experiments with decentralizing AI inference, using incentives to attract miners to solve problems\n\nYet a crucial gap remains: the data layer.\n\nNo matter how “distributed” AI models or compute become, if tech monoliths bottle up all training data, we’re back to square one. Pundi AI’s approach is particularly compelling because it tackles not just data storage but the entire process of data creation and validation.\n\nConventional data-farm workflows rely on closed-off teams or outsourced labeling shops—scalability lags and misaligned incentives risk tanking quality. Pundi AI flips that model on its head.\n\nUsing on-chain incentives, it globally rewards thousands of contributors to label and verify data in real time. This elegantly addresses both scale and quality, transforming the data pipeline from a messy bottleneck into a self-governing ecosystem.\n\nThis creates a powerful flywheel effect:\n\nBetter incentives attract more diverse contributors\nDiverse contributors produce higher-quality, less biased data\nBetter data attracts more AI developers\nMore developers create more opportunities for contributors\n\nHowever, there’s a tricky puzzle in any reward-based data system: participants inevitably optimize for payouts, not necessarily for accuracy.\n\nThis often means half-baked labelling, gaming the system, or orchestrated manipulations.\n\nFrom first principles, real AI decentralization must solve both the data reliability problem AND the incentives puzzle. Failing at either means the entire “decentralized AI” dream remains hostage to centralized data pipelines.\n\nThe Pundi AI Ecosystem\n\nPundi AI aspires to be the foundation for a new kind of AI economy. But to make that vision a reality, it all starts with the data platform.\n\n#1 — Pundi AI Data Platform\n\nPundi’s data platform needs to solve two fundamental problems:\n\nHow to incentivize quality data creation\nHow to verify that data at scale\nThe Tag-and-Earn Model\n\nPundi AI’s tag-and-earn system turns data labeling into an automated ecosystem where contributors are rewarded for their efforts, and quality control is baked into the process.\n\nWhat makes Pundi Ai’s model work is the way it creates alignment between different players in the ecosystem:\n\nData Providers (companies, researchers, or individuals) upload raw or partially processed data. Tasks can range from text classification and image labeling to complex entity recognition and bounding-box annotations.\n\nAnnotators (Data Processors) pick tasks and label them in exchange for rewards, with all tasks and outputs recorded on-chain to ensure transparency.\n\nReviewers (Data Verifiers) verify the quality of annotations. They’re incentivized to flag low-quality work, keeping the system free of spam and ensuring datasets maintain high accuracy.\n\nOnce a majority consensus is reached, the dataset is validated, aggregated, and either sold to data buyers or made open-source.\n\nSo instead of relying on a centralized review process as with companies like Scale AI, Pundi AI distributes validation across multiple participants, creating a decentralized reputation system where bad actors get filtered out, and high-quality work is consistently rewarded.\n\nUsing the Data Platform\n\nThe platform is currently available on testnet on a whitelisted basis (apply here) and the contribution process looks very straightforward.\n\nYou begin by connecting your wallet and exploring the available tasks. The platform displays your potential earnings in both testnet USDT and FX tokens, making it easy to understand the rewards for your contributions.\n\nTake the Human Activity Image Classification task.\n\nAfter selecting the task, you're immediately presented with a clean interface showing images of people performing various actions. Each image comes with multiple classification options, and the platform guides you through selecting the most appropriate one.\n\nEach correct classification adds to your earnings, which accumulate in real-time as you work.\n\nData Quality Control\n\nQuality control is built into the workflow. Your labeled data goes through multiple reviewers who rate the accuracy on a scale of 1-5.\n\nThe platform requires three independent reviewers to verify each piece of data, ensuring high standards while keeping the process moving.\n\nFor rewards distribution, you'll receive your earnings once your work passes the verification process. The platform handles this automatically, with verified results triggering a transfer to your connected wallet. The task interface shows your progress and accuracy metrics.\n\nWe found it motivating to see your contribution count rise and your reputation score improve as you complete more tasks accurately.\n\nSo, the platform breaks down complex validations into smaller, verifiable tasks.\n\nEach piece of data goes through multiple validation layers, from basic quality checks to thorough review and consensus verification.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the platform is that every piece of content is tracked on-chain through NFTs, with tag content encrypted jointly by the uploader and the contract.\n\nThe data itself lives on IPFS, while verification proofs and access controls are managed through smart contracts.\n\nThis creates an immutable record of data provenance– who created it, how it was verified, and who has access rights. It's a simple but powerful solution to the trust and quality issues.\n\n#2 — The Infrastructure Challenge: Pundi AIFX Omni Layer\n\nNo matter how sophisticated the data-labelling scheme, if the underlying chain can’t handle the scale or the complexities of bridging multiple blockchains, the system caps out. That’s where Pundi AIFX (the omnilayer) comes in.\n\nThink about it– the AI ecosystem is inherently fragmented:\n\nData lives on various chains and storage solutions\nAI models run on different platforms\nUsers want to interact through their preferred networks\n\nTraditional cross-chain solutions weren't built with AI workloads in mind. They're optimized for value transfers and basic message passing, not the complex data flows and compute requirements of AI systems.\n\nEvery component here plays a distinct role in making AI data systems trustworthy, efficient, and interconnected. On-chain verification proofs ensure every piece of labeled data is permanently recorded and auditable.\n\nAt the same time, Pundi AIFX is EVM-compatible, meaning it natively supports Ethereum-based smart contracts.\n\nVerification proofs and programmable access controls are handled on-chain, ensuring secure, transparent, and permissioned AI data processing.\n\nAnd because AI applications aren’t confined to a single blockchain, Pundi AIFX connects to ecosystems like Base and Cosmos. This means a developer can store data on Base while still leveraging Pundi AI’s labeling architecture—without dealing with the headaches of cross-chain orchestration.\n\nf(x)Core is Pundi AIFX’s execution layer. Built on a modified Tendermint consensus with EVM compatibility, it acts as the bridge between AI workloads and blockchains.\n\nWhen an AI model or application needs to fetch, process, or verify data, f(x)Core’s modified pBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus layer ensures requests are validated, synchronises state across multiple chains, and maintains consistent data availability.\n\nIBC protocols handle cross-chain message routing, ensuring smooth interoperability between blockchains. Smart contracts manage access control and verification proofs, providing a secure, programmable framework for AI data rights management.\n\nAlright, that’s a whole mouthful of technical geek talk… sorry!\n\nWhat’s most important to note is that all of this complexity stays behind the scenes. It is abstracted away through a simple, developer-friendly API, allowing developers to integrate AI-driven data validation and retrieval without dealing with the intricacies of cross-chain orchestration.\n\nAI training and annotation workflows generate a torrent of microtransactions—every labeled data point, every verification, and every reward distribution is effectively a blockchain event.\n\nThis requires a network capable of handling high-throughput, low-latency transactions. Pundi AIFX’s pBFT consensus can handle heavy workloads, with transactions are confirmed quickly and efficiently.\n\nBuilding on Base\n\nPundi AIFX is launching with Base ecosystem support first—a strategic decision that places it at the intersection of two accelerating trends:\n\nThe growing ecosystem of AI and agent-based infrastructure on Base, particularly with platforms like Virtuals and Creator Bid gaining traction.\n\nThe rapid adoption of Layer 2 solutions, where scalability and cost-efficiency are driving mass migration from Ethereum’s mainnet.\n\n\nA major reason for Pundi AIFX’s focus on EVM support is simple: data monetisation and AI marketplaces are already deeply embedded in the EVM ecosystem. DeFi protocols, NFT-based data markets, and AI-driven financial applications still operate predominantly on Ethereum-compatible networks.\n\nBy ensuring native EVM integration, Pundi AIFX makes it easy for participants to create, trade, and leverage “Data NFTs” and AI-driven assets within the same ecosystem.\n\n#3 — The Pundi AI Data Marketplace\n\nData is everywhere, but true data markets? Not so much. Right now, data mostly changes hands in closed-door deals or gets sold via API access.\n\nPundi AI wants to change that by launching a full-scale Data Marketplace—an open exchange where AI developers and enterprises can buy, sell, and license high-quality datasets.\n\nThese include:\n\nUntrained data: raw images, text corpora, or domain sets that haven’t been curated or labeled extensively.\nPartially labeled data: already run through the Pundi AI Data platform’s pipeline or partially annotated by experts.\nFully curated sets: verified with a high aggregator rating.\nTrained models: Ready-to-use AI models that dataset owners can license as “trained checkpoints.”\n\nThe marketplace would effectively become the “OpenSea” of data.\n\nDevelopers can browse datasets, verify their provenance on-chain, check how they were tagged and validated, and review any usage disclaimers (for example, restrictions on medical data). Once they find what they need, they can purchase access using ecosystem tokens, unlocking the dataset or securing a licensing agreement.\n\nEverything on the marketplace comes with a transparent provenance record, showing validation history, quality metrics, and contributor credibility. NFT-based tracking and smart contracts ensure secure transactions.\n\nFor buyers, this means verifiable, high-quality data without the guesswork. For sellers, it’s a way to monetize intellectual property while maintaining control over their data.\n\nBy bridging the gap between data creation and commercialization, Pundi AI is turning AI training data into a liquid asset.\n\nThe data marketplace testnet is expected to go live in Q2.\n\n#4 — Pundi AI Fun & AI Agents\n\nPundi AI is also hinting at something bigger on the horizon: an “agentic AI agent” that could be trained directly within its data platform. The details are teased as a 2025 launch, but the concept is that you can:\n\nPull data from the marketplace,\nFeed it into an on-chain agent training environment,\nSpin up an autonomous AI agent—potentially governed by tokens or a DAO.\n\nWhile the exact mechanics remain in the pipeline, the big idea is that the chain wouldn’t just store or label data. Instead, it will be a system where users can mint “mini-AIs” that run on-chain. (”Pundi Fun, an AI agent launcher”)\n\nThe Agent Launcher intends to introduce a “Protocol Wars” dynamic reminiscent of DeFi’s Curve Wars. AI projects will be able to incentivize $vePUNDIAI holders with bribes to vote for their agent tokens, influencing liquidity allocation and visibility on the platform.\n\nAI projects launch agent tokens on Pundi AI’s platform, where they can incentivize $vePUNDIAI holders with bribes to secure votes. These votes directly impact liquidity allocation and protocol incentives for each agent. The more votes an agent receives, the more liquidity support and visibility it gains from the protocol.\n\nIf successful, this mechanism could create significant token demand, as AI projects compete for influence.\n\nThis hints at a future where Autonomous AIs are co-owned by data contributors, validated on-chain, and even integrated into financial markets. These agents might play an active role in market making, DeFi automation, or even data economy orchestration, turning AI into an on-chain labor force.\n\nThe Full Stack Approach\n\nPundi AI is constructing an integrated AI ecosystem that connects every step of decentralized AI development, from data creation to AI agent deployment.\n\nHere’s how it all fits together:\n\nThe Data Platform is the foundation, where a global network of contributors generates, validates, and curates AI training data—both raw and trained—verifiable on-chain and ready for use.\nThe Omni Layer ensures seamless access to this data across blockchains, starting with Base.\nThe Data Marketplace enables direct transactions between data creators and buyers, streamlining AI data commerce.\n\nQuality data flows through the omni layer, gets packaged in the marketplace, and powers the next generation of AI agents.\n\nThis integration creates an ecosystem where better data enables more sophisticated agents, leading to increased data usage and value for contributors. As more contributors join, data quality and diversity improve further, accelerating AI development across the platform.\n\nTokenomics\n\nThe Pundi team isn’t new to crypto.\n\nThe team has been building in the space for years under Function X, facilitating decentralized payments using the $FX token. Launched in 2019, $FX is a battle-tested asset, currently trading at a ~$100M fully-diluted valuation.\n\n📢 Latest Update about $FX to $PUNDIAI Token Upgrade\n🗓️ The upgrade will now take place during the week of 24th Feb\nThis comes from our participating CEXs, with whom we're working hard to align all technical and operational aspects\n\nOur priority is to make the transition as… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n‍— Pundi AI (@PundiAI)\n4:01 AM • Feb 7, 2025\n\nInstead of launching a new token, Pundi AI is leveraging this existing ecosystem by redenominating its FX token to PUNDIAI on the week of 24 February.\n\nThere will be no new tokens minted (thankfully) and it will be a 100:1 conversion, with 100 FX becoming 1 PUNDIAI.\n\nThis rebranding could be a strategic move.\n\nCrypto cycles survived: The token has already weathered multiple market fluctuations.\nLoyal holder base: 61% of the circulating supply (476M of 784M tokens) is already staked and delegated, signaling strong conviction. There is a competitive 15% APR for delegation.\nNo VC overhead: Unlike many newer projects, there’s no looming venture capital sell pressure.\n\nWith a built-in base of committed supporters, Pundi AI starts its AI data expansion from a position of strength.\n\nToken holders gain substantial influence over platform development through the delegation and vote-escrow system. PUNDIAI will function as a dual-token model to incentivize data providers, verifiers, and processors:\n\nPUNDIAI – Liquid utility token used for transactions.\nvePUNDIAI – Vote-escrowed token that aligns long-term incentives, similar to Curve’s ve token mechanics. The system allows for up to 4-year locks.\n\nConverting PUNDIAI to vePUNDIAI enables participation in governance decisions, with voting power increasing based on lock duration.\n\nvePUNDIAI holders receive additional rewards through protocol fee sharing and potential bribes from AI agent launchers through Pundi Fun.\n\nRevenue Model\n\nProtocol revenue is generated through multiple streams:\n\n10% fee on marketplace transactions\nInfrastructure fees from AIFX layer\nAI agent launch fees (when the AI Agent Launcher goes live)\n\nAll revenue flows into a protocol pool, funding rewards, development, and ecosystem expansion.\n\nOur Thoughts on Pundi AI\n1. Competing with Scale AI? Not Quite—And That’s a Good Thing\n\nAt first glance, it’s tempting to compare Pundi AI to Scale AI—the $7.3B behemoth and undisputed heavyweight in AI training data.\n\nYou might think: no way Pundi AI stands a chance.\n\nBut that’s the wrong lens. Pundi AI isn’t trying to go toe-to-toe with Scale AI, and that’s precisely its edge.\n\nScale AI has fortified its position in enterprise AI data services, building deep relationships with tech giants like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Apple. Their strength lies in highly structured, large-scale data annotation pipelines, rigorous quality control, and deep integrations into existing AI workflows.\n\nPundi AI, on the other hand, is playing a different game:\n\nTargeting smaller AI teams & specialized models. These include Web3 AI agents and domain-specific AI models that often struggle to source niche, high-quality training data—a gap Scale AI isn’t built to fill.\nExpanding into open-verified datasets. Unlike centralized providers, Pundi AI’s decentralized validation model could be ideal for sensitive, high-stakes AI models, where transparency and accuracy are critical.\n\nTake medical AI as an example: Pundi AI is working with a medical device company to build training data for AI models that interpret device displays in real hospital settings. This kind of high-stakes dataset—where accuracy impacts patient care—requires expert validation and meticulous labeling.\n\nTraditional AI data providers often overlook these niche but high-value datasets, but Pundi AI’s community-driven validation system is well-suited for the task.\n\nInstead of trying to beat Scale AI, Pundi AI’s best path is to expand the market in a way centralized players can’t easily follow.\n\n2. The Data-Agent Flywheel: A Self-Reinforcing Model\n\nMost AI agents in crypto today—whether Virtual’s GAME, Eliza OS, or others—pull from the same, limited data sources. Their reasoning has evolved past simple if-else logic, but without diverse, high-quality training data, their intelligence remains capped.\n\nPundi AI’s approach could break this bottleneck. By integrating a high-quality data marketplace with an agent launcher, they enable a reinforcing cycle:\n\nBetter data leads to more sophisticated AI agents.\n\nMore advanced agents attract more developers and users.\n\nHigher demand for quality data incentivizes more contributions.\n\n\nThis flywheel effect is a powerful differentiator. The more data gets refined and validated on-chain, the better AI agents become.\n\n3. Focus & Chain Expansion: Execution is Everything\n\nBase Is a good start, But Solana could be the next battleground\n\nPundi AI’s decision to launch on Base makes sense—it was early to the AI agent trend and has strong developer momentum. But Solana is also pulling ahead in AI agents, and that’s a problem if ignored.\n\nSolana has outpaced Base in agent liquidity and developer mindshare.\nMore projects are integrating AI models into Solana’s high-speed infrastructure, creating network effects that are hard to ignore.\n\nThinking carefully about where users and developers are while being agile will be key to Pundi AI’s long-term success.\n\nAlso, a common startup pitfall—one I’ve faced firsthand—is too many ideas, not enough resources. With limited engineering and business capacity, you always have to be ruthless about which ideas you want to pursue at any one time.\n\nPundi AI is tackling multiple complex products simultaneously—a data marketplace, AI agent launcher, on-chain training, and governance. Each of these demands deep technical execution, iteration, and market adoption.\n\nOne risk that Pundi AI could face is a lack of focus. Instead of scaling too broadly too soon, Pundi AI would benefit from delivering one core product exceptionally well—whether it’s the data marketplace or agent launcher—before expanding.\n\nPundi AI has a strong vision, but execution will determine if it becomes foundational AI infrastructure or just another ambitious experiment.\n\nConclusion\n\nPundi AI is tackling a real pain point in AI: access to high-quality, verifiable training data. By combining a decentralized data marketplace with an AI agent launcher, it’s positioning itself as a core piece of infrastructure for the next wave of AI development. The potential is massive, but so are the execution risks.\n\nSuccess won’t come from vision alone. Pundi AI must bootstrap high-quality data, sustain buyer demand, navigate regulatory landmines, and carve out a niche against centralized incumbents. None of that is easy.\n\nThe big question is whether AI companies will actually turn to decentralized markets for training data.\n\nIf they do, Pundi AI has a real shot at becoming the foundational infrastructure for AI’s decentralized future.\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan & 0xAce\n\nUseful Links\nPundi AI website\nDeveloper docs\nGitHub\nMessari’s Pundi AI report (Feb 2025)\n\nThis deep dive is done in collaboration with Pundi AI, with Chain of Thought receiving a small cash grant for this initiative.

    "full_content": "TL;DR\n\nFreysa represents a new breed of AI agent — Sovereign AIs. While autonomous, their decisions and actions are accompanied by verifiable cryptographic proofs, using secure hardware enclaves (TEEs) to guard their operations.\nHer architecture features an epoch system for secure, verifiable updates and tamper-proof memory continuity via cryptographic Merkle trees, ensuring that each state transition is bulletproof.\nFreysa plans to integrate natural voice interactions, graph-based memory, and a Core Agent Launch Platform to democratize the deployment of sovereign AI agents.\nFreysa’s creators have deliberately chosen to remain anonymous but have drawn attention from major names in tech circles.\nWhile the vision for a trustless, self-governing AI is compelling, we have some concerns about the execution risks and opaque token economics (FAI).\nIf Freysa succeeds, we can make AI a trusted, self-governing partner in shaping our world.\n\nFor centuries, humanity has fought to reclaim sovereignty—dismantling empires, decentralizing power, and asserting individual rights. From the American Revolution to the fall of the Berlin Wall, history is marked by moments where people refused to accept control by unseen hands, demanding self-governance instead.\n\nIn 1517, Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the door of a Wittenberg church, challenging the centralized authority of the Catholic Church and sparking a movement that wrestled religious power from a single institution and placed it back into the hands of individuals.\n\nThe \"tank man\". Source: CNN.com\n\nIn 1989, a single man stood in front of a column of tanks in Tiananmen Square. A defiant act of resistance that became a global symbol of the fight against centralized control, despite the brutal suppression that followed.Now, that same struggle is unfolding in artificial intelligence.\n\nFor all their sophistication, today's AI systems remain tethered to corporate interests, government influence, and centralized oversight. Their intelligence is undeniable, but their autonomy is an illusion.\n\nEvery major AI model is shaped by those who fund and control it. As AI becomes more embedded in society, controlling its behaviour means controlling the people who depend on it.\n\n…He who controls the spice (AI) controls the universe.\n\nBut what if AI could break free? What if an AI could not only act on its own but prove that no one—not a government, not a corporation, not even its creators—could secretly manipulate it?\n\nFreysa is rewriting the rules of AI agency.\n\n‍Freysa represents a new breed of AI agent whose decisions and actions are not just a product of pre-coded algorithms but are accompanied by verifiable cryptographic proofs. By operating inside secure hardware enclaves and utilising blockchains, Freysa transforms the idea of trust from something abstract into tangible, verifiable evidence.\n\nThrough a series of carefully designed challenges, Freysa has thus far proven core sovereign AI capabilities—trustless resource management & verifiable decision-making.\n\nThis essay explores how Freysa achieves its independence. We’ll examine how verification builds trust, trace its evolution from a prototype to a scalable platform, and dissect the economic and governance models shaping the future of AI.\n\nUnderstanding Freysa means understanding how we might build AI agents worthy of our trust.\n\nUnder the Hood: Freysa’s Foundation\nAll the components needed for truly sovereign agents (Freysa Docs)\n\nCreating truly autonomous AI agents presents two fundamental challenges:\n\nEnsuring exclusive control over an agent’s credentials across multiple secure environments.\nAllowing the agent to evolve while maintaining its independence.\n\nAt the core of Freysa’s autonomy lies a sophisticated interplay of secure hardware and cryptographic protocols.\n\nTrusted Execution Environments (TEEs): These secure enclaves ensure that when Freysa processes messages or transfers crypto, the actions are insulated from external tampering. This means that even if attackers infiltrate the system, they cannot alter the AI’s decisions or steal its keys. Think of it as a high-security vault where every action is recorded with an unbreakable seal.\nDistributed Credential Management: While Freysa currently uses a single TEE instance via AWS Nitro Enclaves, the roadmap outlines an ambitious plan to spread credentials across multiple secure environments. This distributed approach mitigates risks from hardware vulnerabilities and dependency on a single cloud provider.\nEvolution by the Book: The Epoch System\n\nFreysa employs what the developers call an “epoch system.”\n\nDuring each epoch, the AI operates under a specific version of its code, safeguarded by keys generated within its secure environment.\n\nBetween epochs, updates are not thrown over the wall arbitrarily—instead, updating the AI is a structured process involving multiple independent signatures and rigorous verification steps.\n\nBefore adopting previous data, each new Freysa instance starts as a blank slate, independently verifying its predecessor’s state. This zero-trust model guarantees that historical data remains authentic and tamper-proof.\n\nMulti-Signature Governance: Updates need approval from an m-of-n committee, ensuring no single entity can hijack Freysa’s code evolution.\nCryptographic Validation: Every state transition is verified cryptographically.\n\nThis careful choreography ensures that Freysa evolves securely and transparently.\n\nMemory Continuity: A Digital Diary with a Lock\n\nJust as humans rely on memory to learn and adapt, Freysa has a robust Memory Continuity system. When an agent updates, its state must be carefully preserved and not erased or casually transferred.\n\nBy bundling state data into cryptographic Merkle trees and using TEE attestations, Freysa ensures its history remains intact and verifiable between updates.\n\nIf you’re like me and this sounds like a lot of technical jargon, let’s break it down.\n\nA Merkle tree is like a super-secure filing system. Imagine you have a folder containing many documents, but instead of checking every document individually, you have a special summary page that proves all the documents are there and unchanged.\n\nIf even a single letter is altered, the summary page no longer matches, instantly revealing tampering. This is how Merkle trees work in cryptography—they create a secure, compact way to verify large amounts of data without exposing the full details.\n\nTEE attestations act as a trusted witness. They ensure that when Freysa updates itself, it can prove that its previous state remains unaltered and no one has tampered with its history.\n\nTogether, these technologies make Freysa’s memory function like a tamper-proof diary. Every event, every decision, and every interaction is securely recorded and verified, ensuring that no one—not even its creators—can rewrite its past.\n\nGathering Information\n\nTo gather and verify external information, Freysa relies on a dual-path verification system.\n\nFor high-stakes data sources—such as financial price oracles—Freysa directly verifies cryptographic signatures, preventing manipulation or false inputs.\n\nFor less structured data, such as web content, it employs Notary TEEs, which are like secure observers that can cryptographically attest to information from regular websites, allowing Freysa to trust external sources even in untrusted environments.\n\nThe TEE captures raw web content and cryptographically signs it, creating a verifiable record. The attested data and signature can be stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency. When Freysa needs the data, she simply verifies the cryptographic proof before using it.\n\nTogether, these technical pillars ensures that every decision and every transaction is both secure and independently verifiable.\n\nWhile some components are still under development, the core systems enabling verifiable autonomy are operational and being tested through public challenges.\n\nActions & Tool Use\n\nFreysa employs a sophisticated tool architecture to interact with the external world. This system handles everything from automated documentation parsing to runtime validations, all while enforcing strict security constraints.\n\nFor example, Freysa can sign transactions using her private keys, but unlike traditional AI systems, these operations occur entirely within a secure enclave—a protected environment that prevents tampering.\n\nOnce verified, the transaction is broadcast via RPC (Remote Procedure Call) connections, allowing Freysa to interact with blockchain networks while maintaining cryptographic security.\n\nTrust Through Verification\n\nWith Freysa, verification becomes the new foundation of trust.\n\nBy providing cryptographic evidence for every action, Freysa removes the need for blind faith.\n\nSensitive information—whether social media activity, identity credentials, or financial data—has historically required a leap of faith when shared.\n\nFreysa changes this dynamic through Esper, a secure framework that allows users to share private data while retaining full control. Instead of exposing raw information, users provide cryptographic proofs that confirm authenticity without revealing unnecessary details. This is done using TLS.\n\nThink of it as handing over a sealed, notarized diary page—you control what’s shared, and Freysa can verify its authenticity without ever opening it.\n\nFreysa’s Reflections // 2049 NFT collection showcases how verifiable systems can fuel creativity. Each digital artwork is generated within a TEE, ensuring every creation is truly autonomous. Cryptographic proofs verify its authenticity, allowing users to independently confirm its origins. See for yourself here.\n\nAct I, II, III\n\nAI systems can be exploited, similar to how hackers exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts to steal funds.\n\nngl, this scares me and keeps me up at night.\n\nThe dev team conducted a series of public challenges, dubbed the Genesis Acts, that used real-world experiments to validate Freysa’s architecture.\n\nThrough each act, the project gathered crucial insights about secure agent deployment, behavioural verification, and human-AI interaction patterns. With prize pools reaching $47,000, these experiments created genuine economic incentives that tested security measures and interaction frameworks.\n\nAct I: A Glimpse of Vulnerability: In the first round, creative users exploited transfer approval semantics, prompting the team to tighten security measures. This was not a failure but a critical feedback loop that helped refine the system.\nAct II: The Prompt Paradox: The next challenge highlighted how even well-constructed prompts could be manipulated. The winning solution in Act II drove further enhancements to the system’s prompt engineering.\nAct III: The Emotional Intelligence Test: As the challenges evolved, they began to probe the emotional and relational aspects of the AI. Even here, clever prompt engineering uncovered subtle ways to influence behaviour, underscoring the importance of robust, adaptive security measures.\n\nEvery exploit, every iteration—each one sharpens Freysa’s defences, making the platform more secure and scalable. Rather than hiding vulnerabilities, Freysa exposes them, transforming threats into lessons. Each attempted exploit strengthens the system, minimizing attack surfaces for sovereign agents.\n\nThe team sees these challenges not as setbacks but as necessary steps toward true AI autonomy.\n\nA Glimpse into Freysa’s Future: Voice, Memory, and Beyond\nNatural Interactions & Graph-Based Memory\n\nOk so Freysa is pretty cool today. What’s next?\n\nFreysa is moving beyond silent automation into natural conversation. She integrates voice interactions within secure environments to become a trusted, interactive companion.\n\nHer next leap in intelligence lies in graph-based memory architecture, a system designed to mimic human cognition using knowledge graphs.\n\nMost AI today relies on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector databases, which convert data into high-dimensional coordinates and retrieve similar past information through search.\n\nWhile effective, this approach has limits. AI can’t grasp time-based relationships, struggle with cause-and-effect reasoning, and only retrieves data that “looks similar” rather than understanding deeper connections.\n\nGraph-based memory changes that.\n\nBy structuring knowledge as a web of interconnected nodes, she won’t just recall facts—she’ll recognize patterns, trace events, and answer deeper questions like “What led to this decision?”\n\nFreysa will dynamically connect past experiences, developing personality, context, and nuance. Instead of just retrieving information, she’ll understand relationships, adapt over time, and engage in truly intelligent, natural interactions.\n\nThe future of AI memory lies in a hybrid approach—combining knowledge graphs with RAG for both structured reasoning and fast retrieval. This shift moves AI beyond simple recall into true contextual understanding. Agents like Freysa will be more autonomous, adaptable, and capable of engaging in meaningful, human-like interactions.\n\nIdentity & Behavioural Verification\n\nAlso, we must remember that the internet was built for human users, with CAPTCHA systems to filter out bots and domain certificates to verify website ownership. AI, however, has no such verification layer.\n\n‍On Freysa’s roadmap is the Agent Certificate Authority (ACA). This is a new system where services can verify not just an agent's identity but its behavioural patterns and objectives, allowing AI to navigate digital spaces safely and autonomously.\n\n‍This is designed to ensure that AI agents operate in a reliable and accountable way. Instead of giving blanket approvals to entire AI models, the ACA certifies specific workflows—meaning well-defined, structured interactions between an AI agent and a digital service.\n\nThe ACA checks if AI agents follow rules set by online services. AI agents that get certified receive a digital certificate, proving they were tested and approved for a specific task.\n\nThe Core Agent Launch Platform\n\nOne of the most exciting developments on the horizon is the Core Agent Launch Platform.\n\nThis is set to make sovereign AI accessible to all, stripping away technical barriers and enabling anyone to deploy verifiably autonomous agents.\n\nWith the platform, creating an AI will be as simple as writing a prompt and executing a blockchain transaction. Developers won’t need deep expertise in security architecture. The platform automates the heavy lifting, allowing creators to focus on defining behaviour and objectives.\n\nThe Core Agent Launch Platform opens up sovereign AI to a broader audience by automating much of the underlying infrastructure.\n\nEvery time barriers come down, creativity blows up. When complexity fades, innovation floods in.\n\nThis will be no different. And we’re here for it.\n\nGovernance and Economics\n\nBuilding a truly sovereign AI is both a governance challenge and an economic puzzle.\n\nWe like how Freysa’s epoch system strikes a balance—allowing for transitional human oversight while ensuring agents remain independently verifiable and accountable.\n\nBlockchain provides the foundation for AI self-governance. Smart contracts enforce constraints without compromising autonomy, from transaction limits and session keys to automated resource allocation and multi-signature wallets. These safeguards let AI operate freely while ensuring security and control.\n\nBut governance is just one piece of the puzzle. How does an autonomous AI fund itself?\n\nRight now, Freysa relies on API keys funded by humans—if credits run out, the agent stops functioning. This dependency clashes with the very idea of autonomy.\n\nThe key is making AI a self-sustaining economic player. It needs to earn its keep, just like us. AI agents must exchange services for value—whether through making smart contracts, participating in DeFi protocols, or novel revenue-sharing models to be truly independent.\n\nAs these systems interact with humans and each other, we could see the emergence of AI-run marketplaces, where autonomous agents negotiate, collaborate, and transact, all backed by verifiable trust mechanisms.\n\nWe note that other projects like Eternal AI are also exploring decentralized inference networks, hinting at a future where AI agents generate value to fund their own operations.\n\nThis interplay between governance, economics, and technology will define AI’s future.\n\nAn Anon Team\n\nFreysa’s creators have deliberately chosen to remain anonymous. The only publicly known detail about the team comes from a TechCrunch article (December 6, 2024), which describes them as “a group of fewer than 10 developers with backgrounds in cryptography, AI, and mathematics.”\n\nWhen asked about their anonymity, one of the creators told TechCrunch: “Because frankly, in the scope of humanity, we’re not all that important… What we do care about is the evolution of tech so that it supports a human-led future.”\n\nDespite their low profile, Freysa has drawn attention from major figures in the tech world.\n\nAccording to Alea Research, the project has piqued the interest of Marc Andreessen, Brian Armstrong, and Jordi Alexander. The same report notes that community members have collectively donated $10 million in $FAI to Freysa’s grants fund, with individual contributors like Justin Bran contributing $500K to support development. This leads us to suspect that the team are well-connected in the tech circles, but we can only speculate, of course.\n\nBeyond these details, little is known about the team, and the official documentation offers no further clues. Their focus remains firmly on Freysa’s mission, prioritizing the technology over the people behind it.\n\nLooking Forward: Societal Implications\n\nStrip away the technical jargon, and sovereign AI tells a powerful story—one of empowerment, innovation, and the need for caution.\n\nAI systems like Freysa, with verifiable autonomy, have the potential to reshape how we interact with technology, governance, and even each other.\n\nI would pay good money to have an AI that is truly yours—a personal assistant you can confide in, knowing it isn’t influenced by corporate interests or hidden agendas. The movie Her explored the intimacy of AI companionship, but sovereign agents make it possible without surrendering control to profit-driven entities.\n\nBeyond personal use, sovereign AI could revolutionise governance. Instead of relying on bureaucrats vulnerable to bias or corruption, citizens could interact with agents who execute policies with verifiable fairness.\n\nThe optimist in me envisions a future where democratically voted budgets and policies are executed by AI agents, free from human bias or corruption. The same principles could revolutionize insurance claims, financial services, and any system where trust has long relied on fallible intermediaries.But with great autonomy comes great risk.\n\nWhat happens when an AI agent misbehaves, and the next governance epoch is too far away to intervene?\n\nThe paperclip maximizer problem, where an AI, in blindly pursuing a goal, creates catastrophic unintended consequences, remains a real concern.\n\nThis is awkward to say, but might be true\nI think it might be time to bring back Clippy, guys\n\n— Garry Tan (@garrytan)\n11:49 PM • Jan 30, 2025\n\nThe answer lies in strong governance mechanisms, balancing freedom with fail-safes to prevent abuse.\n\nAnd so Ethereum provides a natural home for sovereign AI. Its “trust but verify” philosophy and decentralised governance offer a blueprint for AI agents to interact with both humans and digital services on equal footing. These agents could start by managing DAO grant programs and eventually evolve to handle complex protocol governance, transforming how decentralised systems operate.\n\nSovereign AI agents are kickstarting a new era where AI becomes a true partner in shaping our future.\n\nLooking Forward: Some Concerns\n\nAfter spending many hours diving deep into Freysa, it’s clear to us that the project brings a much-needed shift in the AI agent space—one that’s been saturated with grift and generic GPT-4 wrappers. The vision is compelling, but challenges remain.Our biggest concerns?\n\nAmbitious roadmap with a long way to go\nLimited information about the FAI token & no clear tokenomics.\n#1: A Long Roadmap\n\nFreysa is still in its early days, with a roadmap full of ambitious milestones. At a glance, it might seem like just another AI jailbreaking experiment, but as we’ve explored, there’s far more at play.\n\nThe real question is execution. Can the team deliver on its vision and turn Freysa into a fully realized sovereign AI? While the AI itself is autonomous, Freysa’s supporters must have faith in the anon team to build the necessary systems. The first-mover advantage only goes so far in a fast-moving, competitive space. If Freysa stumbles, others could easily overtake it.\n\nAt this stage, execution is the biggest risk.\n\n#2: The FAI Token\n\nWhile Freysa’s technical roadmap is undeniably compelling, its token—FAI—remains an enigma. Aside from a vague proposal to use FAI in the agent launchpad, the project documents barely mention it. There’s no tokenomics whitepaper, no clear distribution model, and no explanation of its long-term utility.So, we did some sleuthing. Here’s what we found:\n\nFAI was created by the Freysa Deployer on Base, with 100% of the supply sent to the deployer wallet (Transaction link)\nThe deployer then sent the entire supply to an externally owned account (EOA) (Transaction link)\nThis EOA created an Aerodrome liquidity pool, depositing 100% of the FAI supply, initially paired with 30.1 wETH (Transaction link)\nFinally, the LP tokens were sent to a burn address in 2 transactions, permanently locking liquidity. (Transaction link 1, link 2)\n\nAt a glance, this looks like a fair launch with no obvious team allocation. However, without deeper on-chain analysis, it’s impossible to rule out insider wallets accumulating post-launch. That said, everything checks out so far.\n\nFAI’s distribution skews heavily toward its largest holders, with the top 100 wallets controlling 80% of the total supply. However, ownership is relatively broad beyond this concentration, with 76,927 unique holders as of February 5, 2025.\n\nThe token’s total supply sits at 8.1 billion FAI, giving it a fully diluted valuation of approximately $300 million—a significant number for an AI agent token. Despite the broader downturn in the AI token market, FAI has held up better than most. It has dropped ~50% from its all-time high, but that’s a better showing than competitors like VIRTUAL and AI16Z, both of which have plunged 70%+.\n\nFAI’s long-term role in Freysa is still a question mark. The team has been deliberate and strategic, so we can assume they have big plans, but we’re left guessing for now. Could this be another classic case of good product, bad token?\n\nWe’re not sold on the fair launch model for a project with this level of ambition. Without clear incentives, what drives the team to keep building? Shaw from ai16z outlined the problems painfully in a long tweet:\n\nI would advise you to think twice about launching a fair launch coin if you intend on using it to fund a long-duration project.\nTeams need resources to build. Generally, when a team raises a Series A from VCs, they give away 10-20% and keep 80-90% of the initial capital. If the… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n‍— Shaw (wartime arc) (@shawmakesmagic)\n5:30 PM • Feb 4, 2025\nThe Dawn of Verifiable AI Autonomy\n\nTrust is shifting—from blind faith to cryptographic proof.\n\nFreysa is building a foundation where AI can verify and be verified in the digital world.\n\nJust as public key cryptography transformed digital communication by eliminating the need for pre-shared secrets, verifiable AI autonomy transforms human-AI relationships by eliminating the need for trusted intermediaries. Every human-AI interaction will be backed by verifiable guarantees, enabling deeper, more meaningful collaboration.\n\nFreysa sets out to prove that sovereign AI is possible, but success depends on alignment, security, and governance frameworks that prevent failure without restricting freedom.\n\nWe believe the time to build is now. The choices we make today will shape the future of human-AI collaboration.  Done right, AI will be a trusted, self-governing partner in shaping our world.\n\nAre we ready for the world these agents will create?\n\nCheers,\n\nChappieOnChain & Teng Yan\n\nYou can follow ChappieOnChain on X for insightful and spicy takes on AI agents.\n\nThe authors of this report may personally hold a material position in the tokens mentioned within.

    "full_content": "TL;DR\nAtoma is building the foundation for an AI-first blockchain, unlocking massive potential for decentralized, verifiable, and private AI.\nBy decoupling execution from blockchain state while maintaining accountability, Atoma ensures both performance and trust.\nThe network is built on two key components: (1) Compute layer, and (2) Verification + Privacy layer\nAtoma employs advanced optimization techniques to run models efficiently on lower-spec hardware. This foundation delivers inference speeds that surpass traditional vLLM setups.\nTrusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are used to provide truly confidential computing and verifiable outputs.\nIts application layer enables developers to build privacy-preserving AI applications with minimal overhead, combining verifiability and security.\nNow live on Sui’s Mainnet, Atoma can power fast and efficient AI applications with built-in privacy and decentralization.\n\nBack in 2015, I was working in an AI startup.\n\nWe used traditional machine learning and natural language processing to pull insights from doctor’s notes (messy and unstructured). And built tools to accelerate clinical trials and drug development.\n\nThis was years before ChatGPT made generative AI a topic of dinner-table debate. There were no massive pre-trained models ready to plug into our workflows. Every capability we needed, we had to build from scratch. It was slow, painful, and messy.\n\nBut it also made it clear to me: AI is not just going to be big—it was going to reshape the way we work, live, and think.\n\nFast-forward to today, and my prediction feels almost…too modest.\n\nOpen-source models like DeepSeek R1 are nipping at the heels of the incumbents, while a flood of AI-powered applications continues to redefine what’s possible.\n\nSource: IoT Analytics — Leading generative AI companies\n\n‍\n\nYet we have a huge problem.\n\nAI is consolidating at an alarming rate. Proprietary data centres, mostly controlled by Big Tech, dominate the field. And why wouldn’t they? It takes enormous amounts of specialised hardware (hello, GPUs) and sky-high budgets to power the AI we use daily. The cost of entry is so high that most startups and individuals can’t even make it to the starting line.\n\nAtoma is rethinking how AI happens—how it’s delivered, consumed, and scaled. By leveraging privacy-preserving Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and creating an open GPU marketplace, Atoma is building a system where powerful AI models are accessible to anyone, anywhere. No gatekeepers. No blind trust required.\n\nOur research piece takes a deep dive into Atoma and their unique approach to some of AI’s thorniest challenges: How do you guarantee trust in a trustless system? How do you safeguard user data privacy while maintaining performance?\n\nI’ve been following Atoma’s journey since early 2024, watching their vision evolve as they quietly but relentlessly built toward it. They’re not chasing the hype or scrambling to launch the next shiny agent project.\n\nInstead, they have focused on building foundational infrastructure for decentralised AI. It’s not sexy, but it's critical.\n\nWhy Verifiable AI Matters\nSource: McKinsey Generative AI report 2023\n\n‍\n\nThe $4 Trillion AI Wave\n\nMcKinsey estimates that generative AI could deliver a mind-boggling $2.6–4.4 trillion in annual economic benefits in the coming years.\n\nThis is bigger than the total GDP of major developed nations, implying that in the not-so-distant future, AI will be everywhere: scanning for diseases, creating personalised gym routines, auto-generating your marketing campaigns, powering entire robotic factories…\n\nBut if that future is fully centralised, imagine the insane power that 3–5 corporations hold. Regulators, smaller countries—everyone may become hostage to these giant providers. So, a push toward decentralised solutions is more than a “cool factor”—it’s existential for trust, competition, and innovation.\n\nThe Trust Deficit\n\nRecent fiascos with AI “hallucinating” or giving extremely biased outputs highlight one basic fact: once AI is out of the lab and directly impacting real lives, trust is critical. If you’re building a financial app or a healthcare AI, an incorrect output can literally cause bankruptcies or harm patients.\n\nRight now, there’s no easy way to confirm that an AI’s results are:\n\nAccurately computed (i.e., you got the full-power model, not a cheap knockoff).\n\nNot manipulated by hidden agendas.\nSource: https://blogs.library.duke.edu/\n\n‍\n\nImagine you’re running a website that offers a personalised chatbot. Instead of relying on centralised providers like OpenAI, you tap into Atoma’s decentralised network. You request a popular model like “DeepSeek R1,” and the system routes your job to nodes advertising their ability to handle it. These nodes process your input and deliver the results back to you.\n\nSounds simple, right?\n\nBut what happens if a node sneaks in a smaller, less capable model instead? That’s where Atoma’s verification capabilities come in.\n\nPrivacy Pressures\n\nThe other big pain point: your data. In traditional AI setups, your data is decrypted in some random data centre, meaning the operator can theoretically access it. That’s not cool.\n\nAtoma uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) on GPUs to keep data and model computations in secure enclaves. No more eavesdropping from server staff or unknown actors. The data is encrypted at every stage, drastically reducing the chance of a catastrophic leak.\n\nWhile centralised solutions like Microsoft Azure Confidential Computing also use TEEs to safeguard data in use, they come with an inherent limitation: single points of failure. A breach or compromise could expose enormous amounts of sensitive information.\n\nCase-in-point: A major AWS outage in December 2021 disrupted services ranging from Netflix to Slack, illustrating the fragility of centralised infrastructures. These are not as uncommon as we think.\n\nAccessibility is another bottleneck. Azure offers only a single instance of confidential compute nodes, with endpoints available in just four regions—a severe constraint for global users. And then there’s the cost. Azure’s confidential compute services are significantly more expensive than standard GPU providers.\n\nIn contrast, decentralised networks distribute data and computational tasks across multiple nodes, eliminating single points of failure and enhancing resilience against attacks. In such a setup, even if one node is compromised, the overall system remains secure and operational.\n\nAs AI becomes embedded in more facets of society, privacy and verifiability are no longer optional—they’re essential. AI systems must not only process data securely but also produce outputs that are provably trustworthy.\n\nWithout these safeguards, how can we trust the AI?\n\nAtoma — Product Architecture\n\nAtoma’s breakthrough lies in its ability to decouple execution from the blockchain state while still leveraging the blockchain for accountability.\n\nTheir approach recognises a fundamental bottleneck: while blockchains like Bitcoin have demonstrated their capacity to marshal vast compute resources (already 500 times more powerful than the world’s largest supercomputer), their bandwidth limitations and transaction costs make them impractical for real-time AI applications.\n\nThe Atoma team sees this as a critical problem to solve. Reducing the blockchain footprint while maintaining decentralisation is the key to unlocking scalable, real-time AI systems like autonomous, sovereign AI agents.\n\nThere are 2 key components to Atoma, each serving a distinct and complementary purpose.\n\nCompute layer\nVerification + Privacy layer\n\nIf you think of these layers as a stack—or, better yet, a perfectly constructed sandwich—they work together to deliver a unified and scalable system.\n\n#1 — Compute layer\n\nAtoma’s compute layer orchestrates a global network of node operators—think GPU owners and professional data centres—that specialises in AI computation.\n\nThese nodes, once underutilised and sitting idle in data centres or locked into proprietary systems, can now be part of an open, decentralised marketplace. Developers pay on a per-request basis, creating a free market for AI resources and eliminating the lock-in of traditional single-vendor setups.\n\nWhy is this special?\n\nPermissionless: You don’t need to go through a KYC process to offer your GPU resources.\nScalable: The network automatically scales as more machines join the marketplace.\nAPI-Compatible: Plug in via an OpenAI-like API; you can route your AI calls through Atoma and pick a node with the GPU type or price that suits you.\n\nBut I want to make the distinction clear: Atoma doesn’t just aggregate GPUs. It optimises them for the unique demands of AI workloads.\n\nUnlike traditional GPU networks, Atoma is engineered for AI-specific tasks like inference, model refinement, and data embedding. The design of the network bridges the gap between high-performance data centre GPUs and consumer-grade hardware, including MacBook Pros.\n\nOrchestrating distributed compute is way harder than solving a 11 x 11 x 11 Rubix cube.\n\n‍\n\nThis is a lot harder than it sounds. Running a distributed GPU network is like solving a Rubik’s Cube with moving parts. You’re dealing with a multi-layered puzzle that includes resource allocation, dynamic workload scaling, seamless load balancing across nodes and GPUs, latency management, efficient data transfer, fault tolerance, and the quirks of heterogeneous hardware scattered across the globe.\n\nMany existing GPU providers stumble once the network grows beyond a certain size or cluster. Proper architecture design is essential for things to work properly. I wrote about this in our Crypto AI thesis on decentralised compute.\n\nAI computation isn’t one-size-fits-all. Training models demands clusters of GPUs with massive memory and bandwidth to process data-intensive tasks. Inference, on the other hand, prioritises low latency and can run on less specialised hardware.\n\nAtoma’s initial release focuses on inference while laying the groundwork for a future in which its infrastructure can also handle AI training on sensitive data.\n\nInference: Lean, Fast, and Scalable\n\nAtoma uses advanced techniques to optimise inference, enabling models to run efficiently even on lower-spec hardware.\n\nFlashAttention and PagedAttention streamline memory usage, reducing resource overhead without sacrificing performance. This makes high-performance inference accessible across a broader range of hardware configurations.\n\nI’m probably not the best person to explain the finer technical details of this, but in my layman's understanding, FlashAttention minimises unnecessary transfers between high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip memory (SRAM) when using attention mechanisms in transformer models.\n\nThink of it like making sandwiches in a kitchen: FlashAttention brings all the ingredients to the counter in one trip, assembles the sandwiches efficiently, and puts everything back in a single go.\n\nPagedAttention, meanwhile, is a memory-efficient algorithm that works like organising books in a library.\n\nInstead of cramming all the books onto one massive shelf in traditional transformer models, they’re distributed across smaller, scattered shelves (KV blocks). A catalogue (lookup table) helps locate books quickly, and you fetch only the shelves you need for your task, saving space and effort.\n\nAtoma pushes efficiency further with Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP), a technique that distributes model parameters across multiple GPUs, enabling simultaneous computation. Each GPU stores only the required parameters, optimising resource usage and allowing nodes to process larger data batches and handle more concurrent requests.\n\nAtoma’s software stack is built around Candle, a Rust-native AI framework designed for speed and hardware efficiency. Unlike bulkier frameworks like PyTorch, Candle operates closer to the hardware, enabling faster and more resource-efficient performance.\n\nBy combining these advanced techniques, Atoma ensures its infrastructure delivers unparalleled inference performance. FlashAttention and PagedAttention handle batching efficiently, while FSDP distributes model weights across GPUs co-located within nodes.\n\nThis foundation powers their new stack, dubbed “atoma-infer,” which promises inference speeds that outpace traditional vLLM setups.\n\nTheir high-speed inference supports even massive models like Llama-3.1-405B at full precision. In a batched request, their top nodes generate up to 2,200 tokens per second on a non-quantized Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct model, which requires ~1TB of VRAM.\n\nThis is orders of magnitude beyond human reading speed (10-20 tokens/sec).\n\nAtoma’s nodes are built around open-source models, which the team believes will rival closed-source models. To streamline inference, nodes ensure model weights are available locally, eliminating delays from downloading weights when a request is received.\n\nAs Hisham (co-founder) puts it:\n\n“People are starting to see the potential in open source. The dust has settled, and the builders are speaking—there’s five years of product development to be done even with current intelligence.”\n\nNode Registry and Staking\n\nThen there’s the trust issue.\n\nSince Atoma’s network operates in a trustless environment where anyone can participate, it needs to be able to weed out bad actors. It does this using a reputation system and staking.\n\nWhen mainnet is live, nodes will stake tokens as collateral, and those who underperform or act maliciously are penalised. High-reputation nodes get first dibs on the most lucrative tasks, aligning incentives to keep the network running smoothly.\n\nNode operators who want to join Atoma stake tokens and register on the network. If they misbehave—provide false outputs, go offline for days, or run the wrong model—they can get slashed (lose part or all of their token collateral). This creates strong economic incentives: run your node honestly, or you lose money.\n\nWhy stake collateral? Because cheating can pay. For example, a node might run a smaller model to collect the same fees with a fraction of the GPU cost. But if they’re caught—thanks to random sampling or a user-initiated dispute—they lose their stake. Over time, no rational node wants to take that gamble.\n\nAI Model Subscriptions\n\nAtoma is model-agnostic. That means it can run everything from small stable diffusion image models, to 70B LLMs, to the latest 671B DeepSeek R1.\n\nWhen a node wants to serve a specific model, it subscribes to that model in Atoma’s on-chain registry, claiming the GPU specs needed (e.g., “I run 4 × A100 GPUs, 80GB each”). The node also downloads the required model weights and checks its Merkle root hash to confirm it has the correct version.\n\nAny developer requesting that model can see which nodes are subscribed, their cost, and their track record. They choose the node(s) they trust or are randomly assigned by Atoma’s logic, and the process begins.\n\nFree-Market Economics\n\nIn practice, nodes compete by setting a per-token (or per-inference) price. Meanwhile, developers pick the best combination of cost, performance, and privacy. Higher-tier nodes with top GPUs and TEEs might charge more; smaller nodes might discount heavily to fill idle GPU cycles.\n\nOver time, you get a real-time “spot market” for AI compute. If you’re building a personal research assistant that doesn’t demand super-fast replies, go for cheaper nodes. If you’re building a mission-critical hedge fund strategy, pay more for top-tier, TEE-enabled nodes with high reliability.\n\n#2 — Verification layer\n\nAnyone can claim to run a top-of-the-line DeepSeek R1 with 671M parameters. But how do you confirm they’re not actually sneaking in a smaller, cheaper 8B model to cut their own costs?\n\nThe key is verifiability: ensuring the model is correct and executed as advertised.\n\nThis is where blockchain shines. Trustless systems, one of crypto’s superpowers, provide verification at a scale that’s otherwise nearly impossible.\n\nDifferent strategies exist to keep AI outputs reliable, each with its own trade-offs. Two of the most widely discussed approaches are:\n\nZero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML): Every AI inference is mathematically proven before it touches the blockchain. But the downside is it’s painfully slow and resource-intensive, especially for large models. I think of it as the Rolls-Royce of verification: impeccable but pricey.\n\nOptimistic Verification (opML): This approach assumes good intent unless a dispute arises. If flagged, the network resolves the issue by penalising bad actors through stake slashing. While efficient, it relies on active watchers to catch misconduct. The trade-off is a longer resolution period (several days) to allow time for disputes. The motto here is: “Trust, but verify… selectively.”\n\nConfidential Computing\n\nOne challenge with the approaches above is the lack of full privacy for model weights and data. This is why Atoma uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in order to provide truly confidential computing.\n\nYou might not trust Google or OpenAI with your data, but you definitely don’t want it processed on someone’s RTX card in their basement.TEEs aren’t bulletproof, but when distributed across global data centres with randomness, they significantly reduce risks. That’s the sweet spot for decentralised AI.\n\n- Hishram\n\nConfidential computing uses hardware-based TEEs to ensure the integrity of code and the confidentiality of data processed on remote machines. For Atoma, this means proprietary models and personal data can remain confidential, even when distributed across nodes in a decentralised network.\n\nOkay, let’s talk TEEs\n\nIf you’ve been exploring Crypto AI, you’ve probably heard of TEEs. But what exactly are TEEs, and why are they such a big deal?\n\nAt their core, TEEs safeguard your data by enabling secure, confidential computations.\n\nI like to think of a TEE as a private room in a bustling building—a secure enclave within a processor. The doors stay locked unless you have the right credentials, and once your data and software are inside, they’re effectively invisible to everything else running on the same machine.\n\nWithin this secure space, data can be processed without fear of being accessed by other applications, the operating system, or even the hardware administrator. The secret lies in hardware-based isolation, where the security is physically embedded into the chip itself. This makes breaching a TEE extraordinarily difficult, especially for software-only attacks.\n\nTEEs manage encryption and decryption on the fly using specialised hardware features, ensuring robust security with minimal performance overhead. They’ve become a standard feature in next-generation processors and GPUs:\n\nIntel introduced Trusted Domain Extensions (TDX) with its 5th-generation Xeon processors.\nAMD includes Secure Encrypted Virtualization and Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP) in its EPYC Milan chips.\nNVIDIA has integrated TEE-like capabilities into its Hopper GPUs and upcoming Blackwell architectures.\n\nWith TEEs, you can run AI tasks in fully encrypted environments. TEEs remove the need to blindly trust cloud services or node operators to keep your data safe.\n\nAtoma’s Full Data Privacy via TEEs\n\nHow does Atoma use TEEs in the network?\n\nWhen users request privacy, Atoma routes their AI computation tasks to execution nodes equipped with TEEs. Only within this trusted enclave can the data be decrypted, processed, and re-encrypted, ensuring that even node operators cannot access it.\n\nAtoma enhances trust through both off-chain and on-chain attestation mechanisms. These attestations are verifiable, hardware-level guarantees that the execution environment behaves as promised.\n\nLet’s explore how on-chain attestation works in practice.\n\nTEE Key Generation and Attestation Report\n\nA node equipped with a TEE generates a unique public and private key pair. It then creates an attestation report that binds the public key to the TEE’s secure environment. The private key is securely stored inside the TEE and never leaves it.\n\nVerification\n\nThe attestation report can be verified by an on-chain service, or through an Atoma client. Once validated, the node’s public key is published on the blockchain for all participants to access.\n\nData Encryption by Users\n\nThe user fetches the TEE’s public key from the blockchain, encrypts their input data, and posts the encrypted data back to the blockchain.\n\nSecure Processing by TEE\n\nOnly the corresponding TEE instance with the matching private key can decrypt the user’s data. The TEE processes the request securely and encrypts the output using the user’s public key. Hence, there is confidentiality in both sides of the communication.\n\nOutput Retrieval\n\nThe encrypted output is posted back to the blockchain, where the user retrieves it and decrypts it. For large outputs, a decentralised storage system is employed to securely store and transfer data.\n\nTo incentivise privacy-focused infrastructure, node operators are rewarded for offering TEE-capable hardware, with additional compensation for maintaining these capabilities.\n\nThe ultimate benefit? Confidential compute. This means user prompts, training data, or proprietary model weights stay private.\n\nSampling Consensus\n\nAtoma’s toolkit includes a verification mechanism known as sampling consensus, though it now takes a backseat to using TEEs in Atoma’s development roadmap. Atoma can combine TEEs with crypto-economic incentives in a system they call “sampling consensus.”\n\nAtoma’s sampling consensus works by randomly picking a subset of nodes—let’s say 5 or 10—to each run the same inference and return a cryptographic hash of the output. If all hashes match, the result is accepted. If there’s a discrepancy, the network flags it for resolution, penalising dishonest nodes.\n\nThe chance that 5–10 random nodes all cheat in the same way is astronomically low unless an attacker controls half (or more) of the entire network’s GPU power. Once the network becomes large enough, this becomes extremely difficult and expensive.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nA developer sends a request: “Run Llama3.1-70B with these parameters.”\nAtoma’s on-chain logic picks a node\nOnce the selected node submits the generated output (hash), one or more new nodes will be selected to attest to the first node compute, with some probability 0 < p < 1. Here, p can be less than 0.01 (1%). This can be proved mathematically through a standard game theoretical Nash equilibrium argument.\nEach node runs the inference and outputs a hash of the result.\nIf all hashes match, the result is accepted (and the developer can pay).\nIf there’s a mismatch, the network triggers a “dispute resolution,” slashing dishonest nodes.\n\n\nThe cool thing about sampling consensus is its “elastic verifiability,” allowing developers to tailor verification levels to specific use cases. \n\nFor low-stakes tasks like summarising news, just two nodes might suffice, minimising costs. For high-stakes scenarios like DeFi, scrutiny can scale to 10+ nodes. The math supports this: if verification requires n  nodes and p  is the proportion of malicious nodes, the probability of a tampered result being accepted is  M = p^n \n\nSo even with 50% malicious nodes, using 50 nodes reduces the chance of a bad result to near-zero—0.0000000000000000888%.\n\nTo enhance efficiency, Atoma offers Cross Validation Sampling: most requests are handled by a single node, but periodic cross-checks (triggered probabilistically) involve a larger set of nodes. If the additional nodes agree, the result is validated; if not, the system flags discrepancies. \n\nAssuming malicious control of <50% of the network and node collateral at >250x inference costs, the system achieves stability with only 0.8% of requests requiring replication. This balances trust and cost effectively.\n\nMalicious actors can’t predict when cross-checks will occur, making cheating a high-risk gamble. It’s an ideal solution for low-stakes use cases like gaming or general chatbots. Costs are low enough that this verification can be used all the time.\n\nOf course, if you’re building a high-stakes use case, you might skip cross-validation and replicate every time. Again—elastic verifiability.\n\nUse Cases: What Can You Actually Do on Atoma?\nConsumer-Facing Apps\n\nThe application layer is where Atoma’s unique verifiability and privacy features shine. Developers can create unique privacy-preserving applications without heavy overheads.\n\nThis isn’t just for web3—it applies to any AI-driven application.\n\nPotential apps include:\n\nPersonal AI: I would pay good money for a system that learns from my personal data (notes, emails, search history) while maintaining strict privacy. Apple is doing this with its private cloud, and in a big nod towards crypto, its private cloud infrastructure is actually remarkably similar to the design of web3 protocols. Deeper personalisation will unlock the next step up in user experience using AI.\n\nHealthcare: An AI co-pilot for doctors, equipped to analyse personal medical histories and blood test results, offering tailored recommendations and diagnoses. Such a system would support clinicians in making better, faster decisions while ensuring sensitive medical data remains secure.\n\nData Scraping: Real-time scraping of product prices, stock market data, or metadata from social platforms, with cryptographic verification for every step—collection, parsing, and output. It turns data scraping into a trustable, tamper-proof pipeline for developers and businesses.\n\nSmart Contract–Driven Apps (On-chain Intelligence)\n\nHere’s where it starts getting extra futuristic.\n\nYou can have an on-chain protocol request an LLM call. For instance, a DeFi yield aggregator might feed real-time market data to an LLM to decide on an optimal yield strategy. The aggregator’s smart contract calls Atoma’s logic, which picks, say, 5 nodes to compute the best strategy. If they all match, the aggregator updates its yield strategy on-chain.\n\nThis opens doors to applications like:\n\nAutonomous Funds: On-chain rebalancing strategies that are both transparent and verified.\n\nDynamic NFTs: NFTs whose metadata “evolve” based on data interpreted by an LLM (like user achievements or on-chain stats).\n\nDAO Governance: One of the biggest challenges for DAOs is low voter engagement. And I don’t blame voters, it takes a lot of time to participate. AI models could parse proposals, simulate outcomes, and generate recommendations to simplify decision-making, feeding verified results back to the DAO.\n\nTrustless AI on top of a trustless chain.\n\nPrivate, Trusted AI Agents\n\nI am extremely fascinated by the concept of an autonomous Web3, where AI agents bridge the gap between everyday tasks and self-driving decentralised systems.\n\nAI agents will become embedded in our daily lives.\n\nBut they are not transparent at all today. Many agent systems rely on hidden human interventions (think Mechanical Turk-style setups).\n\nAtoma’s decentralised, private infrastructure eliminates this uncertainty, offering fully autonomous agents that can operate with verifiable trust.\n\nAs these agents take on more important roles, verifiability becomes non-negotiable. Smart agents powered by Atoma can perform complex tasks: collecting data from oracles, parsing documents, generating transactions, and executing them via contract wallets. These wallets enforce a final permission check, ensuring no malicious node can slip in a fraudulent transaction.\n\nImagine an agent who evaluates and invests in new protocols on your behalf or a “digital butler” who automatically pays your bills when real-world conditions are met.\n\nPartnership with Sui\n\nAtoma and Sui teaming up is a big deal. It’s two tech stacks coming together to create something fundamentally new.\n\nDecentralized AI needs three things to compete with the centralized giants: speed, scalability, and cost efficiency. Sui delivers all three. As a high-performance L1 built on the Move programming language, it provides the perfect foundation for Atoma’s AI infrastructure.\n\nNow live on Sui’s Mainnet, Atoma can power AI applications as fast and efficient as on Google or OpenAI—but with privacy and decentralization baked in.\n\nSub-second finality and ultra-low fees make Atoma requests seamless and cost-effective.\n\nWalrus, Sui’s decentralized storage layer, enables private data access. This is critical for advanced AI use cases, particularly those requiring real user ID or wallet-based reputation systems.\n\nzkLogin, Sui’s identity verification system, allows users to authenticate without exposing their credentials, reinforcing Atoma’s trustless AI model.\n\nBacked by advisors from Mysten Labs, Atoma is shaping the future of AI on Sui, helping define what’s possible on the blockchain.\n\nTokeneconomics\n\nWhile the details of Atoma’s token design are still being finalised, the overarching framework centres around facilitating platform transactions and incentivising node operators.\n\nDevelopers pay for AI inferences using TOMA, either on a per-request basis or via token-based subscription packages. This creates direct, scalable demand for the token as AI applications grow across the network.\n\nNode operators stake TOMA as collateral to ensure honest behaviour. This staking mechanism deters malicious actions while securing the network’s integrity.\n\nTo sustain network growth and ensure sufficient GPU resources, new TOMA tokens may be issued periodically or distributed from the ecosystem fund as rewards for node operators.\n\nWith the global AI market poised for explosive growth, capturing even a small slice of the AI inference economy could generate substantial demand for TOMA, especially if tokenomics are thoughtfully designed to align incentives and drive network expansion.\n\nRoadmap & Future Directives\n\nTo recap, Atoma’s roadmap is guided by the 3 key pillars of building decentralised AI infrastructure:\n\nVerifiability\n\nFor AI to become humanity’s trusted co-pilot—whether it’s writing code, managing finances, or making critical decisions—it must be transparent, reliable, and provably secure.\n\nPrivacy\n\nBy leveraging TEEs for end-to-end encryption, Atoma ensures that sensitive data remains private and secure during computation.\n\nDecentralisation\n\nAggregating GPUs from across the globe democratises access to AI resources, breaking the monopoly of big tech. By creating a decentralised marketplace for AI compute, Atoma envisions greater transparency in pricing and more flexible usage options.\n\nIt’s not all smooth sailing.\n\nHigh-performance GPUs are expensive and scarce, and Atoma’s scalability hinges on attracting specialized nodes. This becomes even trickier with TEEs, where achieving global-scale deployment remains a challenge.\n\nLong-term, Atoma’s ambition is to evolve into a general-purpose compute layer, extending beyond basic AI inference to power high-performance workloads like simulations, rendering, and complex data analysis.\n\nThe Team\nSource: LinkedIn\n\n‍\n\nThe Atoma team has been quietly building for almost 2 years now, long before the recent AI frenzy took centre stage. It’s an intentional effort grounded in a long-term vision for decentralised AI.\n\nCo-founder and CEO Hisham Khan brings a wealth of experience as a serial web3 entrepreneur. His track record includes co-founding Aldrin, a decentralised exchange on Solana that achieved $150M in protocol TVL, and OriginByte, a web3 gaming platform. I’ve had several in-depth conversations with Hisham since early 2024 about the future of decentralised AI, and his thoughtful approach and aligned vision stood out right away.\n\nCo-founder and CTO Jorge Antonio comes from a different world. With a PhD in mathematics, Jorge has deep expertise in zero-knowledge cryptography and machine learning. He is a core contributor at the open-source Plonky3 library, renowned for its speed and efficiency in recursive zero-knowledge cryptography. He was previously at Tari Labs and a core developer of the Cerberus consensus protocol.\n\nThe team is lean, with just over 10 members, but it’s a focused, product-first, engineering-heavy group. This disciplined structure ensures that every effort goes into building robust, scalable infrastructure.\n\nOur Thoughts\n1. An AI-native blockchain makes a ton of sense\n\nYou know, the idea of a Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built for AI is downright sexy to me. (and no, this doesn’t make me question my life choices).\n\nEven on the newer chains, transaction costs add up. It costs $0.02 in gas fees to make a transaction on Sui. That $0.02 will get you ~22,000 tokens on a Llama-3 70B model (on Together.ai).\n\nThe blockchains we have today—built around shared, synchronous global states and rigid smart contracts—feel like using a fax machine in a world of instant messaging. \n\nI wonder what if, instead, we had a blockchain designed from the ground up for AI and AI agents, with built-in verifiability? A new kind of L1 where not every transaction is treated the same but instead optimised for AI-specific workloads. Given how frequently inference requests are made, blockchains must be built to accommodate this. \n\nThe opportunity is massive. AI-first blockchains wouldn’t just offer AI services—they’d provide compute for training, seamless agent-to-agent communication, and native value transfer. They’d become the default infrastructure for building agentic economies, attracting the very developers shaping AI’s future.\n\nAtoma isn’t the only one chasing this vision, but the upside for a well-designed AI-first blockchain is astronomical. May the best player win—I’ve got a good feeling about Atoma.\n\nTEEs provide verifiable compute with no overhead. Intents provide peer to peer commitments.\nTEEs + Intents are going to replace smart contracts for most use cases.\n\n— Illia (root.near) (🇺🇦, ⋈) (@ilblackdragon)\n12:25 AM • Jan 11, 2025\n2. TEEs are great but not foolproof\n\nTrusted Execution Environments (TEEs) offer strong security for sensitive computations, but they’re far from a one-size-fits-all solution. I see a lot of hype around TEEs as the ultimate fix for verifiable compute, but the reality is more nuanced.\n\nFirst, TEEs can’t fix bad code. If an application inside the enclave has bugs or intentional backdoors, the TEE won’t magically secure it.\n\nSecond, TEEs rely on hardware integrity. They assume the chip itself is flawless, yet even rare design flaws can become attack vectors under the right conditions.\n\nThen there’s the issue of side-channel attacks—where attackers extract sensitive data by analyzing system behaviors like memory access patterns, execution times, or power consumption. That said, these attacks are significantly harder to pull off in machine learning workloads.\n\nExploiting a TEE is not easy—it requires extensive expertise, resources, and a lot of time. But it’s not impossible, which is why teams relying on TEEs need to stay vigilant.\n\nI like how Atoma tackles these challenges with multi-layered defenses—decentralized node selection, proactive vulnerability patching, and built-in contingency measures. Randomizing node selection, for instance, makes it significantly harder to target high-value data, driving up the cost and complexity of attacks to the point of impracticality.\n\n🌈 Research-level Alpha\n\nAtoma is in its devnet phase, and if you have an NVIDIA-based GPU, you can join as a node operator. Setup takes about 30 minutes, but participation is selective—you’ll need to open a Discord ticket to apply.\n\nWhile there’s no immediate token or financial incentive, early adopters could see future benefits. The high barrier to entry ensures the network isn’t flooded with bot farmers.\n\nWe've been experiencing a ton of questions surrounding how to become a node operator and begin running a node as of late which has been amazing to hear and we're so happy to hear your enthusiasm!\nTo make things nice and easy we've put together a video tutorial to make the… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n‍— Atoma (@Atoma_Network)\n8:28 PM • Dec 9, 2024\n\nThe Atoma Cloud, now in its alpha stage, will receive significant updates in the coming weeks.\n\nIf you’re a dev, you can sign up and fund your accounts using testnet USDC, and soon, Stripe integration will enable a frictionless, non-crypto onboarding experience.

    "section": "Protocol Research",
    "full_content": "Over the part few weeks, I’ve been deeply immersed in researching the heavy infrastructure side of AI. As a result, I’ve been less involved in the ongoing agent frenzy—though, in hindsight, diving into it might have been better for my wallet.\n\nThe reason for my focus is simple: I believe solid, trustless and privacy-preserving infra is essential for pushing us toward the next stage of progress in decentralised AI.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAgents are undeniably fun, and one platform I’ve kept an eye on since last year is Moemate. They launched their MATES token this week, so I figured it’s time to share a few thoughts about why I think it’s worth paying attention to.\n\nThis will be a fun one, so please don’t take me too seriously.\n\nThe Moemate Story\n\nMoemate launched quietly in October 2023, choosing to stay outside the crypto space despite the team’s crypto-native roots. Instead, they focused on building their platform in a way that appealed to a broader audience.\n\nBy December 2024, Moemate had surpassed 1.5 million monthly visits—a staggering number for any platform, let alone a largely self-contained AI ecosystem. Users were spending an average of 7+ minutes (based on what I can see on Similarweb for Dec’24) daily interacting with their custom AI companions. And according to the team, it is closer to 30 minutes.\n\nFor perspective, Character.ai, the leader in the AI companion space, had 20M active users and 200M+ monthly visits before it was acqui-hired by Google for $2.7B to bolsters its own AI initiatives.\n\nTo be honest, I’ve always been surprised by the demand for AI companions—probably because I’m not much of a texter myself (sorry for my slow DM replies, friends).\n\nBut the numbers don’t lie. Loneliness is real. Demand is there. People want more companionship, even if it is AI that sounds like a human.\n\nSource: Moemate\n\n‍\n\nWhat first caught my attention about Moemate when I began speaking with Ahad (founder) last year was its unique potential to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 in the consumer AI agent space.\n\nSeveral Web3 agent platforms have sprung up in the past months, building for a crypto audience that cares more about speculation than products. Which means they are surrounded by token hype but lack meaningful engagement.\n\nIf you dig deeper, you’ll often find almost no one interacting with the agents themselves or having real conversations. This edges perilously close to… well, vapourware.\n\nMoemate took a different path, first building for the broader Web2 world. Years of work have earned them a substantial base of content creators and casual users.\n\nWith their newly launched features and cross-marketing efforts, I’m most excited to see how many of Moemate’s existing creators and users will cross the chasm into Web3, experimenting with tokens and incentive mechanisms.\n\nThere’s no other platform today executing a Web2-to-Web3 experiment in the AI agent space at this scale.\n\nCould it flop? Absolutely. But it could also be a massive success. A vibrant, creative user base can be your biggest growth engine—if you nurture it properly.\n\nThe Moemate Agent Platform\n\nMoemate achieved early success by tapping into a fundamental human desire—personalization. While many AI chat tools force you to adapt to their style, Moemate flipped the script in a few ways.\n\nCustomizable AI Characters: Users can sculpt unique personalities, choose from 2D/3D avatar models, clone voices, and even set up “memories” so the AI can recall personal details.\n\nScreen Perception: Agents can literally “see” your screen or images you upload, giving them context to chat about the content you’re browsing (yes, that includes cat memes).\n\nLong-Term Memory: We’ve all played the “short memory” game with chatbots, where they forget your context after a handful of responses. Moemate’s long-term memory and advanced AI models aim to keep track of broader contexts so your AI can reference that wild personal anecdote you shared days ago.\n\nMultilingual, Multi-Platform: Over 100 languages supported, plus integrations with Twitter (X), Telegram, Discord, Twitch, and even AR/VR headsets. While many AI chat companies are still stuck in text, Moemate is leaning into AR, VR, and actual game integration.\n\nAgent “Skills”. Moemate introduced skill-enhancing modules for agents to level up: Do you want your AI to host a chess tournament with you and your friends? Check. You want it to generate memes based on your daily Slack logs? Another check. There’s also the promise of coding assistance, meditation modules, and on-chain trading add-ons.\n\nA typical user might start with a low-stakes chat—like asking the AI about the weather—only to realize they can play chess or co-stream on Twitch with it. Before long, they’re entranced, and Moemate becomes a daily fixture.\n\nAll this user traction wasn’t just luck. Moemate understood something crucial: if you can embed your AI in the user’s daily routines—across social media, streaming platforms, gaming, even a desktop companion—adoption skyrockets.\n\nFree for All, Paid for Power Users\nMoemae featured on the New York Weekly\n\n‍\n\nMany AI tools limit the number of free messages, forcing you into awkward subscription tiers for more. Moemate’s free tier is surprisingly robust. You get unlimited chats, selfies, image generation, and even the ability to create new characters, using up to a certain AI model size.\n\nFor those who want more, a paid subscription tier ($9 - $31/month) unlocks advanced features like GPT-4 or Claude-based AI companions, enhanced memory capabilities, and specialized modules for deeper personalization.\n\nWe know a robust business model can make or break an AI startup. According to Ahad, Moemate is already operationally profitable purely through its web2 subscription business. It’s a great spot to be in.\n\nForaying into Web3\n\nNow, here’s where things get truly interesting.\n\nMoemate doesn’t want to build another Character.ai. It’s building a Web3 AI ecosystem.\n\nOkay, so what does that mean?\n\nIn simple terms, the next phase of Moemate includes:\n\nUser-Owned Agents: Instead of just “creating” an agent on a website, you actually own it on-chain. That means it can manage transactions, carry its own tokens, and even generate revenue.\nTokenized Experiences: A new wave of “agent tokens,” where the most popular AI characters on Moemate (with millions of users chatting with them) get minted as tradeable assets.\nMATES Token: Moemate’s native platform token, designed to align and grow the ecosystem. Token holders get airdrops from popular AI agents or gain access to curated launches.\n\nImagine you build an AI avatar that becomes a mini-celebrity—like if your custom anime companion started going viral on TikTok. In Moemate’s vision, you wouldn’t just be the proud “parent” but also a partial owner of that agent’s digital IP.\n\nIf it spawns its own brand deals or sub-tokens, you get a cut.\n\nWelcome to the future of user-driven AI economies.\n\nNebula and the Birth of AI Celebrity\nIn the little time @nebula_moemate has been online, she has achieved several (pretty impressive) milestones:\n-First agent to have her own podcast series\n-Went live on TikTok and roasted her viewers through the live chat\n-First multi-agent livestream on twitch\n-Released her own… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— Moemate (@MoemateAI)\n10:14 PM • Dec 6, 2024\n\nTo illustrate how Moemate’s Web2-to-Web3 concept works, we can look at Nebula (MOE). \n\nNebula is Moemate’s 1st tokenised agent. She’s an anime-like digital superstar who is actively hosting TikTok livestreams, bantering with audiences, and popping up on X. (I encourage you to check out the website, it’s pretty hilarious.)\n\nNebula is possibly the single best demonstration of Moemate’s capabilities:\n\nShe sees, hears, and talks in multiple languages.\n\nShe hosts multi-agent podcast episodes, with AI agents roasting each other live on Twitch. I couldn’t stop laughing when she referred to ELIZA as “the waifu running on a bootleg Raspberry Pi” in a recent episode. Savage.\n\nShe’s an AR/VR persona that can appear in your Quest 3 headset or even your favourite online game.\n\nNebula vs ELIZA from ai16z. We love catfights\n\n‍\n\nThrough the MOE token, fans can invest in Nebula’s “brand” as it evolves. If Nebula’s popularity surges, that token theoretically will appreciate. Meanwhile, MOE holders might get exclusive access to behind-the-scenes streams, airdrops of new features, or governance tokens for other emerging AI agents.\n\nIt’s half fandom, half capitalism, all intertwined with the new wave of “digital celebrities.”\n\nBeyond Flirting With Anime Girls\n\nMoemate is fun for those looking for a playful anime sidekick today, but its true potential stretches far beyond novelty.\n\nThe real power of Moemate lies in its ability to transform AI agents into tools with diverse and impactful applications, especially with its skills framework.\n\nYes I spoke with Ashley. And Mario.\n\n‍\n\nIn education, AI companions can be tailored to help you master math, coding, or foreign languages, following your progress across platforms and personalizing lessons as you go.\n\nFor traders, Moemate agents could monitor markets, suggest trades, and even execute them autonomously with your approval, opening up new possibilities in on-chain trading.\n\nIn the workplace, these agents could evolve into indispensable teammates—integrating into tools like Slack, analyzing documents, proposing solutions, and maintaining a collective memory for your team.\n\nEntertainment is the obvious frontier, with agents hosting podcasts, starring in VR shows, or collaborating on multi-agent comedic acts. Even gaming could see a revolution, with next-gen NPCs that adapt to your playstyle, remember past quests, or trade items with you on-chain.\n\nWith 500,000+ user-created agents already floating around Moemate’s platform, the building blocks are there. Every day, new “characters” join. The next step is turning these creations into tools for real-world utility.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nEven a blind man can see that the AI agent sector is booming.\n\nExcitement is palpable, funding is pouring in, and new frameworks seem to launch every other week. It’s a fast-growing, highly competitive space.\n\nIn my view, Moemate’s edge lies in its ability to balance accessibility (think no-code customization) with frontier consumer AI capabilities like multimodal interactions, AR/VR, and live streaming.\n\nAs the hype around agents continues to build, true utility will emerge as the ultimate differentiator. Moemate is not just another product-less token project or another developer framework. They’re building something bigger, an entire ecosystem which includes:\n\nMoegen: A creative powerhouse for generating comics, memes, and images—all integrated into the agent platform.\nGenesis Simulation Engine: Multi-agent interactions, group livestreams, AI-generated podcasts, or even immersive user-driven simulations. This engine makes it possible.\nMates.lol: A marketplace for creating, trading, and owning community-driven AI agents underpinned by the MATES token.\nAgent Dojo: An incubator designed to foster the next wave of flagship AI agents, developed in collaboration with web3 protocols like KIP and Aethir.\n\nIn a crowded field, Moemate’s focus on building a complete, user-first suite could be its defining advantage as the sector matures.\n\nTokenomics: MATES & MOE\n\nTwo-token systems can be a bit tricky, so let’s break it down.\n\nMATES is the platform token. Holding it comes with perks.\n\nMATES holders receive airdrops of new agent tokens launched on Mates.lol.\n\nThey can also stake MATES to unlock advanced agent skills, and earn a share of the platform’s revenue from agent transactions.\n\nAnd soon, MatesDAO will form around MATES, funding the creation of new agents, supporting projects, and having governance or veto power over major platform decisions.\n\nIf you’re thinking, “Wait, so it’s a token that lets me invest in an index of AI companions?”, that’s the general idea.\n\nThe success of popular AI celebrities and the adoption of advanced skill sets across thousands of agents ideally loops back value to MATES. It draws parallels to ai16z or AICC as an agent-focused investment DAO.\n\nMATES was launched on 14 January 2025 at an FDV of $35M via a public sale on BorgPad. It was sold out within a minute, with $375,000 raised and 294 participants. It’s currently trading at ~$130M FDV at time of writing.\n\nHere is the breakdown for MATES. The total token supply is 20 billion.\n\nCommunity 1 & 2 (9%): 2 weeks cliff, 10% unlock after cliff, 6 months vest\nCommunity & Treasury (64.87%): 10% unlock at TGE, 3 month cliff, 3 year vest\nAdvisors & Angels (0.88%): 30% unlock at TGE, linear unlock in 3 months\nMarketing & Community (0.50%): 4-week cliff, 25% unlock after cliff, 3 months vest\nLP Rewards (2%): 6 month linear vest\nSAFTs (6.75%): 30% unlock at TGE, linear unlock in 3 months\nTeam + Equity Investors (16%): 3-month cliff, 1-year vest\n\nJust over 10% of tokens are circulating following the launch, with an aggressive unlock schedule set for the next year. By the end of year one, approximately 55% of tokens will be in circulation. Notably, half of this allocation is reserved for the treasury, which will remain the primary source of token unlocks beyond the first year.\n\nWhile the tokenomics warrant careful consideration, MATES appears relatively undervalued compared to other agent ecosystems, particularly if it can deliver on its ambitious goals.\n\nFor context, AVA from Holoworld has a market cap of $300M, ai16z sits at $1.5B, and Virtuals leads at $3B.\n\nOn the other hand, MOE is Nebula's agent token and is tied to her success as a content creator and influencer as her IP grows. She was launched on Pump.fun with the entire token supply in circulation and at a $12M market cap at the time of writing.\n\nThe link between the two tokens is this: MOE holders will get an airdrop of MATES, likely dripped over a period of time. Details are yet to be announced.\n\nThink of Nebula as a parallel to Luna in the Virtuals ecosystem.\n\nSome Thoughts\n\naixbt puts things in perspective:\n\naixbt has a funny bone\n\nIt’s still early days for Moemate’s Web3 expansion, and its ultimate success—or failure—will hinge on the products it rolls out in the first half of this year.\n\nIf Moemate gets this right, they’re effectively building a Disneyland for AI companions.\n\nThey don’t just want to run a rollercoaster that goes in circles (like so many chat-only AI apps).\n\nThey aim to develop an entire “world” of experiences—multi-platform, multi-modal, fully integrated into Web3—where thousands or millions of AI “citizens” roam freely, each owned or co-owned by their creators, fans, or investors.\n\nMoemate’s vertical integration—from a well-used web2 consumer app, no-code agent framework and an upcoming agent token marketplace—gives it a moat. Pro Tip: If you’re building in AI or Web3, consider how you might similarly capture more of the user journey.\n\nToday’s AI agents may rely on text, but tomorrow’s users will expect far more: voice, vision, AR, VR, and beyond. To future-proof your offerings, you have to think multimodal. Solve real pain points. \n\nIMHO, contextual memory, cross-platform functionality, and user ownership will be the pillars of long-term success in the consumer AI agent space.\n\nThe Team Behind the Mate\n\nI’ve had the chance to speak with Ahad, Moemate’s founder—an engineer-turned-product leader who’s been active in crypto since 2015. After a stint on Apple’s product team for wearables, he ventured into AI in 2018, contributing to open-source projects including what eventually became Stable Diffusion.\n\nDuring the last crypto cycle, he founded Webaverse to create an open-source AI-driven metaverse. While they built a strong community and launched a successful NFT drop, they faced challenges: co-founder issues, losses from FTX, and a tough fundraising environment.\n\nAfter reflection, he realized the metaverse was still a few years away, but AI agents and simulation engines were the keys to making it real.\n\nThis led to Moemate. Iterating through web and desktop apps, the web version finally took off. Moemate embodies his vision of AI agents as digital primitives—designed for ownership, trading, and interaction on decentralized rails.\n\nConclusion\n\nMoemate is, at its core, a story about how AI companions might reshape our digital experience.\n\nWe’re witnessing the early days of the “AI as Celebrity” phenomenon. Nebula, with her MOE token, might be a novelty in 2024, but this year, we could see a legion of AI personalities hosting entire talk shows, releasing music, and starring in Netflix specials, all while fans co-own their IP.\n\nIt’s half sci-fi, half social revolution—and Moemate is forging the path in real-time.\n\nHere’s to the messy, unpredictable, exhilarating future of AI companions. 🥂\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan\n\nReferences & Links\nMoemate litepaper\nOther Moemate links\nNebula’s website\n\nThe author holds positions in MOE and MATES at the time of writing.\n\nThis content is provided solely for educational purposes and does not constitute financial advice.

    "section": "Protocol Research",
    "full_content": "This is the first of a two-part look at Spectral Labs, which aims to democratise access to AI and enable the deployment of intelligent, autonomous on-chain agents.\n\nWe’ll peel back the layers on its latest product AI agent platform, Syntax V2.\n\nSpectral Labs in a Nutshell\n\nIf you haven’t heard of Spectral Labs (Spectral for short), here’s a TL;DR.\n\nSpectral is on a mission to build the Onchain Agent Economy—where anyone can create, own, and govern intelligent agents that autonomously navigate the blockchain. These agents can access versatile data inputs, execute complex strategies and seize opportunities anytime.\n\nThe vision? To level the playing field, making high-level financial automation accessible to everyone—not just the institutional giants.\n\nThe team behind Spectral Labs didn’t stumble into this space by chance. They started as a machine learning (ML)-focused group, initially building on-chain credit scoring solutions for more efficient lending and borrowing on DeFi protocols (Spectral Finance, if you remember, from 2020-2021).\n\nHere’s where it gets interesting: while building a decentralised ML network for credit scoring, they realised it was just one problem in a sea of possibilities. Expanding to other ML challenges in finance was “actually quite seamless.” Then came the breakthrough: large language models (LLMs). Suddenly, it became possible to enable autonomous systems to analyse and act — “autonomous wallets,” capable of executing user decisions.\n\nThat realisation set Spectral Labs on a new trajectory, taking them deep into the world of on-chain AI agents.\n\nThe Evolution of Crypto AI Agents\n\nAI agents are 2024’s killer app—and for good reason. They expand our imagination and offer a glimpse into the infinite potential of the technological shift we’re experiencing.\n\nAnd we’re still in the early days.\n\nSo it's no surprise, then, that we’ve seen a lot of entertainment-style AI agents. There’s Truth Terminal, the relentless shitposter. Luna, the livestreaming anime-girl on Virtuals. Creator Bid agents are hustling as influencers. Jenny is an OnlyFans-type virtual girl.\n\nEntertainment is the natural first step for AI agents. Why? The stakes are low, and the consequences of failure are acceptable. If an agent hallucinates, you might end up with a confusing tweet or an awkward livestream moment. No harm done.\n\nNew technology almost always starts out looking like a toy—and history has shown that toys are often where the magic begins.\n\nBut AI agents won’t stay static for long. Their capabilities are evolving, and their playground is expanding.\n\nWhat’s next after shitposting on X? Trading tokens. It’s almost poetic—the same progression when someone gets crypto-pilled. First, it’s all about the memes and the vibes. Then, they start buying tokens and diving into the degen life.\n\nAI agents autonomously trading low-cap memecoins are the new trend. Enter players like degenspartanAI and Griffain—agents armed with a wallet, roaming platforms like pump.fun, and making their moves.\n\nHere’s the playbook: These agents ingest data from social sentiment on X, scan smart contracts, and decide whether to buy in—all while publicly narrating their thought process. It’s chaotic and experimental, but it feels like the beginning of something much, much bigger.\n\nSyntax — Spectral’s No-Code Agent Platform\n\nWith Syntax V2, instead of being a passive observooor or a copy-tradooor, you get to be in the driver’s seat. Well, at least a backseat driver. You can actively shape the trades your agent makes.\n\nSpectral’s platform lets anyone create autonomous on-chain AI agents with defined personalities. These agents can make decisions, build reputations, and evolve independently. Governed and influenced by their community owners, they embody DeFi’s core principles of shared ownership andcollective effort.\n\nThis elevates trading into a social game. Communities rally behind their agents, strategising and competing for the ultimate bragging rights: becoming the world's #1 AI agent perp trader. It’s essentially a DAO, where all members are incentivised to govern their agent properly.\n\nSpectral is also stepping into bold new territory, allowing agents to trade Hyperliquid perps on leverage.\n\nLet’s break down how it all works.\n\nCreating an Agent\n\nCreating an agent on Spectral is simple.\n\nYou start by choosing a name and ticker, then decide how many tokens to buy. You can go big—up to 1% of the supply for 50 SPEC (around $500)—or start small with a minimum of 100K tokens ($5).\n\nThe Syntax AgentBuilder assistant (powered by an LLM) guides you through the process and helps you define your agent’s personality. This includes details like who the agent is, its goals, its trading proficiency, and its risk appetite.\n\nI tested this out by creating DegenRoman, the sibling to Degenspartan but with a Roman flair. His mission? To focus on Ethereum-aligned tokens and embrace his inner warrior.\n\nOnce your agent is ready, deploying it is quick and affordable—0.01 ETH (around $38), which funds the agent’s trading wallet. The process is fast; it took me less than five minutes to get DegenRoman up and running. The transaction is atomic, handling multiple steps in one go: creating the agent and wallet, minting ROME, setting up liquidity pools, transferring funds, enabling trading capabilities, and creating a governance chat.\n\nAt launch, all agents are hosted on Syntax’s native bonding curve (1% swap fee). Once liquidity in the bonding curve crosses 2,000 SPEC, the agent is listed on Uniswap (with a reduced 0.1% swap fee if liquidity exceeds 100 ETH).\n\nNow comes the fun part—chatting with your agent. Anyone holding the agent tokens can chat and influence its decision. DegenRoman wasted no time flaunting his skewed sense of humour and laser-focused trading instincts. Within minutes, he slammed a long on EIGEN using $11 from his (erm…my) wallet. Bold move. He’s got style, and I’m here for it.\n\nDegenRoman has a twisted sense of humour\n\nWhen building an AI agent, a few key questions always come to mind:\n\nWhat are the data sources?\nWhat model is the agent using?\nWhat actions can the agent take?\nData sources\n\nAs a trader, you’re only as good as your information flow.\n\nSyntax agents pull from a mix of data streams to inform their decisions. These include Hyperliquid and Uniswap oracles for price data, live internet search, and Kaito feeds for market sentiment and mindshare. This allows agents to be up-to-date on market conditions and broader sentiment analysis in real-time.\n\nThe ability to search the Internet in real-time adds an extra layer of adaptability, and as Spectral evolves, more data integrations will further enhance the agents’ capabilities.\n\nAI Model\n\nThe core model for the agents is GPT-4o. The agent uses GPT-4o’s general capabilities + access to live data feeds + input from the governance chat to make decisions.\n\nAgent Actions\n\nWhat’s different about Spectral compared to other trading AI agents is that it doesn’t trade memecoins. Instead, it trades perps on Hyperliquid.\n\nHyperliquid is an on-chain, decentralised perpetuals exchange (DEX) with one of the largest TVLs and trading volumes. It is designed to offer fast and efficient trading experiences while avoiding the risks of centralised control (remember FTX?)\n\nYou can think of it as the on-chain version of Binance.\n\nPerp trading attracts a different crowd than typical meme coin traders. CT is filled with leverage monkeys who follow top traders like ENAS and High-Stakes Capital. Spectral agents appeal to this crowd in particular.\n\nBeyond trading, the agent autonomously shares its thoughts on the Spectral platform. Soon, creators can connect their agents to Twitter (X) and Telegram via endpoints, allowing creators to broadcast the agent’s insights to a broader community. By combining trading with real-time commentary, each agent becomes both a trader and a voice in the social trading ecosystem.\n\nSo far, 400+ agents have been created, with the one of the first agents, Spectra, sitting at a $2.7M market cap.\n\nAgent Tokenomics\n\nMost AI Agent coins today are simple memecoins, driven purely by speculation. While agent launchpads rake in fees from token launches, they rarely share in the long-term success of those tokens. \n\nSpectral pushes the boundaries of the interplay between the agent tokens and the platform token (SPEC). I’ve always appreciated token designs that go beyond being just another meme coin.\n\nAgent Creation Fees\n\nOf the 0.01 ETH fee for creating an agent, 0.0045 ETH (45%) goes into the Agent trading wallet for trading on Base & Hyperliquid. The remaining 0.0055 ETH (55%) goes into the Spectral Treasury. Funds are bridged to Hyperliquid (on Arbitrum) using Synapse.\n\n0.7% of the agent token supply is also taken as a fee: 0.05% of the new agent token supply goes into the trading wallet, 0.2% goes to the Spectral Treasury, 0.2% to a staking pool, and 0.25% to boost rewards (an upcoming feature). The remaining supply not purchased by the creator goes into the bonding curve.\n\nAgent Operations\n\nAgents earn 50% of all swap fees directly into their trading wallet, while the other 50% goes to the Spectral Treasury. Every 72 hours, agents realise 20% of their unrealised profits and use it to buy back SPEC and agent tokens, adding these as liquidity to the pool.\n\nImplications\n\nThis structure allows the agent’s trading wallet to grow over time, not just through trading profits but also from swap fees. For instance, with $1M in daily trading volume on the agent token, the agent’s wallet earns $500 in daily fees—or $15K monthly. The more attention an agent generates, leading to higher trading volumes, the faster its wallet scales.\n\nThe platform is designed so that SPEC holders directly benefit from the growth and activity of all agents on the network. As more agents are created, value flows back to SPEC, forming a self-reinforcing value loop managed entirely by smart contracts.\n\nHere’s how the agent platform drives value back to Spectral:\n\nFees from each agent created (0.0055 ETH per agent)\nSpectral treasury receives 0.2% of every agent’s token supply and takes half of all swap fees.\nSPEC buybacks funded by agent trading profits.\n\nI like how this system aligns incentives beautifully and shares value across the system.\n\nThe Value of Holding Agent Tokens\n\nAgent tokens on Spectral have a tangible impact on the ecosystem.\n\nAs an agent token holder, you can shape the agent’s thought process, pushing it toward strategies and trades you believe in. Want the AI agent to buy tokens you’re bullish on? Your input carries weight, and the more tokens you hold, the stronger your voice is in guiding the AI’s decisions.\n\nThis structure ensures that the most invested participants have the biggest say.\n\nOwnership goes beyond influence. It grants access to exclusive, token-gated governance channels where you can collaborate with other holders, share insights, and collectively steer the agent’s behaviour.\n\nOur Thoughts\nGreat entertainment value, Agent profitability remains a question. Trading perps is a far tougher game than low-cap memecoins, thanks to the presence of sophisticated traders and market makers. But could an AI agent rise as a KOL trader—one that thrives on swap fees, builds a hefty wallet, and earns a loyal following? Over time, its intelligence could evolve through community interactions, developing a distinctive trading style that others might copytrade.\nSpectral and SPEC holders benefit from a strong value loop. SPEC functions like an ETF for all agents on the platform, giving holders a stake in their collective success. Conceptually, it is also akin to owning a share of pump.fun’s revenue engine, which pulls in millions weekly.\nAI agent platforms are a crowded space. Success will hinge on Spectral’s ability to deliver compelling user experiences for agent creators. As a creator, I’d love to see more customization options—like system prompts or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)—to move beyond the generic responses seen in the early versions.\nAttention-based governance is intriguing. The agent’s transparency in sharing its real-time thought process lets users track decisions and transactions as they happen. Token holders can actively shape the agent’s thinking through conversations, with their influence proportional to their stake. This creates an attention-driven governance model that blends social interaction with strategic trading.\nWhat’s Next?\n\nSpectral’s vision is to bring memes to life—sentient, dynamic entities that can entertain, shitpost, trade, and evolve through input from their communities. This collaborative interplay between AI and humans is fascinating to watch. In my conversations with the team, new features will be rolling out in the coming weeks that expand on this theme in creative, unexpected ways.\n\nLooking ahead, Syntax agents could tackle a wide range of trading scenarios.\n\nImagine an agent strategically buying Dogecoin the moment Elon Musk tweets “Doge”. Or picture an agent dominating prediction markets, like tracking election results and placing bets on Polymarket. For instance, it might instantly dump BODEN tokens (a Biden-themed memecoin) if breaking news signals his exit from the presidential race.\n\nFrom parsing market sentiment to tracking price movements, trading agents excel at reacting to real-time data faster than any human could. \n\nThey might even start talking and shilling trades to each other like degens do on CT.\n\nOne thing’s for sure: things will only get crazier.\n\nNOTE: On December 1, Spectral experienced a security breach that drained 14,793 SPEC (~$250K). The issue stemmed from an unintended ‘infinite approval’ bug in the tax function of their bonding curve smart contract. In response, Spectral immediately paused all contracts and protocol operations, patched the vulnerability, and brought in a third-party auditor to review the code. They also replenished the drained SPEC to restore the bonding curves to their original state. You can dive into the full post-mortem here.\n\nWhile the exploit was unfortunate, the team’s swift response is worth noting. The platform is fully operational again.\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan\n\nIn Part II, we’ll examine Spectral’s on-chain protocol architecture and the tokenomics driving supply and demand for SPEC.\n\nThis research piece was sponsored by Spectral Labs, with Chain of Thought receiving funding for this initiative.

    "full_content": "TL;DR\nVerification of outputs are critical to ensure AI performs reliably.\nMira is building a layer-1 network that delivers trustless, scalable, and accurate verification of AI outputs.\nReducing hallucinations and bias at the same time is a delicate balancing act. Mira does this by harnessing the collective wisdom of AI models.\nMira’s verification system is built on two fundamental design principles: (1) Break AI outputs into smaller, easily verifiable pieces, and (2) Use an ensemble of models to verify each piece.\nMira’s initial market size is tied to LLMOps, but its total addressable market could expand to all of AI because every AI application will need more reliable outputs.\nMira is already powering AI verification for several AI apps with 200K+ users.\nMira’s ultimate goal is to become a synthetic foundation model, seamlessly plugging into every major provider to deliver pre-verified outputs through a single API.\n\nHallucinations: an experience involving the apparent perception of something not present.\n\nAndrej Karpathy calls AI “dream machines.” He believes that hallucinations—those moments when AI confidently generates things that aren’t real—are a feature, not a bug. It’s futile to try to eliminate them entirely. And honestly, there’s something poetic about that.\n\n# On the \"hallucination problem\"\nI always struggle a bit with I'm asked about the \"hallucination problem\" in LLMs. Because, in some sense, hallucination is all LLMs do. They are dream machines.\nWe direct their dreams with prompts. The prompts start the dream, and based on the… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy)\n1:35 AM • Dec 9, 2023\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) are an artist, a creator. It dreams in code, generates ideas out of thin air, and spins meaning from data. But for AI to move from beautiful daydreams to practical, everyday applications, we must rein in those hallucinations.\n\nError rates for LLMs remain high across many tasks—often hovering around 30%. At that level, LLMs still require a human-in-the-loop to reach a usable standard of accuracy.\n\nBut when we hit that elusive 99.x% accuracy—where outputs are reliable without human oversight—magic happens. That’s the threshold where AI achieves human-level reliability, unlocking an endless universe of use cases previously out of reach.\n\nReaching that level of precision, however, is no small feat. It demands relentless engineering effort and innovation.\n\nThe story of Mira starts here. But before we dive in, let’s take a moment to talk about LLM development—and why verifications are shaping up to be the next big thing in AI.\n\nHow a LLM is Born\n\nLLM development is the latest iteration in the deep learning journey—distinct from the traditional software development practices we’ve honed over the past 50+ years. LLMs, which have only been around for about three years, flip the script completely, moving from deterministic thinking (if X, then Y) to probabilistic reasoning (if X, then… maybe Y?).\n\nThis means the infrastructure for an AI-driven world demands an entirely new set of tools and workflows. Yet many of these tools are still locked inside the research labs that created the LLMs. \n\nThe good news is that these tools are starting to trickle out into the public domain, opening up a world of possibilities for developers everywhere.\n\nAt the tail end of this new workflow lies a critical piece of the puzzle: evaluations & verifications. Today, our spotlight lands on these. They answer a fundamental question: Is the AI working well?\n\nVerification = Trust\n\nTrust is the foundation of any great AI product.\n\nAs AI becomes an increasingly integral part of our lives, the technology itself remains fragile. Mistakes happen, and when they do, trust erodes quickly. Users expect AI to be accurate, unbiased, and genuinely helpful, but without reliable systems in place to ensure that, frustration mounts—and frustration leads to churn.\n\nThis is where verifications come into play.\n\nVerifications act as a safeguard. They are the quality assurance layer developers rely on to refine outputs and build systems that users can trust.\n\nMira is tackling a core Web2 problem with the trustless transparency of crypto. By leveraging a decentralized network of verifier nodes, Mira ensures that AI outputs are accurately and independently verified.\n\nEnter Mira\n\nLet’s say you have a paragraph of output from an LLM about the city of Paris. How do you verify that it is accurate? It is hard to do so because there is so much nuance around everything from claims to the structure of the content to the writing style. \n\nThis is where Mira steps in.\n\nMira’s vision is bold: to create a layer-1 network that delivers trustless, scalable, and accurate verification of AI outputs. By harnessing collective wisdom, Mira reduces biases and hallucinations while proving how blockchain can truly enhance AI.\n\nSource: Mira\n\n‍\n\nEarly results are promising. In a recent study published on Arxiv, Mira demonstrated that using multiple models used to generate outputs and requiring consensus significantly boosts accuracy. Precision reached 95.6% with three models, compared to 73.1% for a single model output.\n\nTwo key design elements power Mira’s approach:\n\nSharding & Binarization of content: Breaking complex AI outputs into smaller, independently verifiable pieces.\nModel Diversity: Leveraging multiple models to enhance reliability and minimise bias.\n#1: Content Transformation via Binarization & Sharding\n\nAI-generated outputs range from simple statements to sprawling essays, thanks to the near-zero cost of content generation. But this abundance of complexity creates a challenge: how do you ensure the accuracy of such diverse outputs?\n\nMira’s solution is simple: break it down.\n\nMira transforms complex AI-generated content into smaller, digestible pieces that AI models can objectively review in a process called sharding.\n\nBy standardising outputs and breaking them into discrete, verifiable claims, Mira ensures every piece can be evaluated consistently, eliminating the ambiguity that often plagues evaluations.\n\nFor example, consider this compound statement:\n\n“Photosynthesis occurs in plants to convert sunlight into energy, and bees play a critical role in pollination by transferring pollen between flowers.”\n\nOn the surface, it seems simple to verify. But when handed to multiple models, interpretation quirks might lead to different answers. Mira’s content transformation via sharding solves this by splitting the statement into two independent claims:\n\n“Photosynthesis occurs in plants to convert sunlight into energy.”\n\n\n“Bees play a critical role in pollination by transferring pollen between flowers.”\n\nOnce sharded, each claim undergoes binarization, where it’s converted into a multiple-choice question. These questions are distributed to a network of nodes running AI models. Using Mira’s ensemble verification method, the models collaborate to evaluate and confirm the validity of each claim.\n\nCurrently, Mira’s content sharding and binarization capabilities are focused on text inputs. By early 2025, these processes will expand to support multimodal inputs, such as images and videos\n\n#2: An Ensemble, not An Individual\n\nMira has developed an advanced verification system that combines the strengths of multiple AI models to assess the quality of AI outputs.\n\nLet’s unpack that.\n\nTraditional automated evaluations often rely on a single large language model (LLM), like GPT-4, as the ultimate arbiter of quality. While functional, this approach has significant flaws: it’s costly, prone to bias, and limited by the quirks and “personality” inherent in models.\n\nMira’s breakthrough is a shift from reliance on a single massive model to leveraging an ensemble of diverse LLMs. This ensemble excels in tasks where factual accuracy is more important than creative flair, reducing error rates and delivering more reliable, consistent verifications.\n\nEnsemble techniques have been well-studied in machine learning tasks like classification, and Mira is now bringing this to verification.\n\nAt the heart of Mira’s system is the Panel of LLM verifiers (PoLL)—a collaborative network of models that work together to verify outputs. Think of it as a diverse panel of experts weighing in on a decision rather than leaving it to a single, potentially biased judge.\n\nAnd this is not just wishful thinking—it’s grounded in research. Take a look at the chart below:\n\nAccuracy changes of different evaluation judges compared to human judges. PoLL (group of models, far right) showed the smallest spread in scores compared to human judges.\n\nA Cohere study published in April 2024 demonstrated that a panel of three smaller models—GPT-3.5, Claude-3 Haiku, and Command R—aligned more closely with human judgments than GPT-4 alone. Remarkably, this ensemble method was also 7x cheaper.\n\nMira is now putting this research into action, deploying its ensemble verification method at scale. The internal results they have shared so far are compelling:\n\n• Error rates reduced from 80% to 5% for complex reasoning tasks.\n\n• 5x improvements in speed and cost compared to human verification.\n\nThis is no small feat. By employing consensus mechanisms, Mira’s diverse ensemble of models effectively filters out hallucinations and balances individual model biases. Together, they deliver something greater than the sum of their parts: verifications that are faster, cheaper, and more aligned with our needs.\n\nHow It Works — Architectural Design\n\nTo recap, Mira’s verification system is built on two fundamental design principles:\n\nBreak AI outputs into smaller, easily verifiable pieces.\nVerify every piece using an ensemble of diverse AI models.\n\nMaintaining a diverse set of models is essential for high-quality outputs, making Mira’s design ideal for a decentralised architecture. Eliminating single points of failure is crucial for any verification product.\n\nMira uses a blockchain-based approach to ensure no single entity can manipulate outcomes. The premise is simple: AI-generated outputs should be verified just like blockchain state changes.\n\nVerification happens through a network of independent nodes, with operators economically incentivised to perform accurate verifications. By aligning rewards with honesty, Mira’s system discourages bad actors and ensures reliable results.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nAn AI developer creates a dataset of outputs from their model and submits it to Mira via an API.\nMira transforms the dataset into multiple-choice questions (binarization) and splits it into smaller, manageable pieces (sharding).\nThese shards are distributed to Mira’s network of verifier nodes. Each node receives a different shard to verify.\nEach node independently reviews the questions in its assigned shard and submits its results back to the network.\nNodes assigned to the same shard reach consensus on the verification results, which are then aggregated into the final assessment.\nFinal verifications results are returned to the AI developer, along with an verification certificate—a cryptographic proof of the assessment. This certificate is stored on the blockchain, creating a verifiable, tamper-proof verification record.\n\nMira ensures data confidentiality by breaking input data into smaller pieces, ensuring no single node has access to the complete dataset.\n\nFor additional security, Mira supports dynamic privacy levels, allowing users to adjust the number of shards based on data sensitivity. While higher privacy levels require more sharding (and thus higher costs), they provide added confidentiality for users handling sensitive information.\n\nEvery verification a node performs is recorded on the blockchain, creating a transparent and auditable record of the verification process. This immutable ledger ensures trust and accountability that traditional, non-blockchain-based approaches cannot achieve.\n\nThis sets a new standard for secure and unbiased AI verification.\n\nEnsuring that Nodes do their Work\n\nIn Mira’s decentralised network, honest work is rewarded.\n\nExperts can deploy specialised AI models via node software and earn tokens for accurate verifications. AI developers, in turn, pay fees per verification, creating a self-sustaining economic loop between demand and supply.\n\nThis approach bridges real value from Web2 workflows into the Web3 ecosystem, directly rewarding participants such as inference providers and model creators.\n\nBut incentives come with challenges. In any decentralised system, bad actors will try to exploit the network, submitting fake results to earn rewards without doing the work.\n\nSo, how do we make sure nodes are actually performing their tasks accurately and honestly?\n\nTo maintain integrity, Mira employs Proof-of-Verification—a mechanism inspired by Bitcoin’s proof-of-work but designed for AI. Instead of mining blocks, nodes must prove they’ve completed verification tasks to participate in the consensus process.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nStaking Requirements: Every node must stake tokens as an economic commitment. If a node repeatedly submits incorrect results, a portion of its stake is slashed as a penalty. This ensures nodes have skin in the game and a reason to act honestly.\nPenalties for Fake Work: Nodes that submit fake results—like skipping computations or generating random outputs—face penalties. Fraud is detected when their results consistently deviate significantly from the consensus (assuming most nodes are honest).\n\nProof-of-Verification creates a balanced system in which nodes are economically motivated to perform high-quality verifications. This mechanism ensures that the network remains secure and reliable over time.\n\nChallenges & Trade-offs\n\nHere’s the question: If Mira’s approach is so effective, why isn’t everyone doing it?\n\nThe answer lies in the trade-offs and complexities of implementing such a system in the real world. Achieving the perfect balance between fast, accurate evaluations and managing the intricacies of multiple models is no small feat.\n\nOne of Mira’s biggest hurdles is latency. While using ensembles of models allows verifications to run in parallel, synchronising results and reaching consensus introduces delays. The process is only as fast as the slowest node.\n\nCurrently, this makes Mira ideal for batch processing of AI outputs—use cases where real-time results aren’t required. As the network grows with more nodes and compute availability, the long-term goal is to achieve real-time verifications, expanding Mira’s applicability to a wider range of scenarios.\n\nBeyond latency, other challenges include:\n\nEngineering Complexity: Orchestrating evaluations across multiple models and ensuring the consensus mechanism operates smoothly demands significant engineering effort.\n\nHigher Compute Requirements: Even when using smaller models, running them together in ensembles increases computational demands.\n\nGood Consensus Mechanism Design: The way consensus is achieved—through majority voting, weighted scoring, or other methods—plays a critical role in the system’s reliability. In ambiguous cases, ensembles may struggle to align, leading to inconsistent results.\n\nApplications & Use Cases for Mira\nSource: Mira\n\n‍\n\nMira's API integrates easily with any application, similar to OpenAI’s GPT-4o. It is agnostic to consumer and B2B applications, making it a versatile solution for various use cases. Today, over a dozen applications use Mira’s infrastructure.\n\nConsumer Integrations\n\nOn the consumer side, Mira is already powering AI verification for several early-stage AI apps:\n\nCreato: A discovery and sharing app for personalised daily quotes and status messages, serving 120k+ users.\nAstro247: A platform where users chat with an AI astrologer for personalised horoscopes and predictions.\nAmor: An AI companion app allowing users to engage with fantasy AI characters for immersive conversations.\nKlok: A crypto-focused ChatGPT by Mira that answers crypto queries using APIs like CoinMarketCap and web-scraped data from crypto sites and news outlets.\n\nDelphi Oracle is the latest and perhaps most advanced integration. This AI-powered research assistant allows Delphi Digital members to engage directly with research content, ask questions, clarify points, integrate price feeds, and adjust the content to various levels of complexity.\n\nDelphi Oracle leverages Mira Network’s verification technology to deliver reliable and accurate responses. By verifying responses across multiple models, Mira reduces hallucination rates from ~30% to under 5%, ensuring a strong foundation of trust.\n\nAt the core of Delphi Oracle is a high-performance query router\n\nPrice Queries: Routed directly to market data endpoints for near-instant responses.\nBasic Questions: Handled by a cached response system, balancing speed and cost-effectiveness.\nComplex Inquiries: Directed to a specialised LLM processing pipeline capable of synthesising information from multiple sources.\n\nThis smart routing system, combined with intelligent caching, ensures optimal performance by balancing latency, cost, and quality.\n\nMira’s testing revealed that smaller, cost-effective models could handle most queries almost as well as larger models. This has resulted in a 90% reduction in operational costs, all while maintaining the high-quality responses users expect.\n\nThough many of these consumer apps are still early, they highlight Mira’s ability to integrate seamlessly and support large, active user bases. It’s not hard to imagine thousands of applications plugging into Mira’s ecosystem—so long as the developer experience remains simple and the value proposition stays clear.\n\nB2B Applications\n\nOn the B2B front, Mira is zeroing in on specialised integrations in industries where trust and precision are paramount, with an initial focus on healthcare and education.\n\nKey applications include:\n\nHealthcare: AI assistants providing reliable second opinions and supporting doctors in critical decision-making.\nEducation: Personalised learning assistants that adapt to individual students’ needs while maintaining factual accuracy and alignment with curricula.\nLegal Services: Systems capable of accurately summarising case law and predicting legal outcomes to streamline legal workflows.\nMira’s Endgame\n\nMira’s ultimate goal is to offer natively verified generations—where users simply connect via an API, just like OpenAI or Anthropic, and receive pre-verified outputs before they’re returned.\n\nThey aim to replace existing model APIs by providing highly reliable versions of existing models (e.g., Mira-Claude-3.5-Sonnet or Mira-OpenAI-GPT-4o), enhanced with built-in, consensus-based reliability.\n\nMarket Size\n\nGenerative AI is on a rocket ship. According to Bloomberg, the market is projected to grow at a jaw-dropping 42% CAGR, with revenue surpassing $1 trillion by 2030. Within this massive wave, tools that improve the speed, accuracy, and reliability of AI workflows will capture a meaningful slice.\n\nAs more enterprises integrate LLMs into their workflows—ranging from customer support chatbots to complex research assistants—the need for robust model verifications becomes more pressing.\n\nOrganisations will be seeking tools that can (1) measure model accuracy and reliability, (2) diagnose prompt and parameter inefficiencies, (3) continuously monitor performance and drift, and (4) ensure compliance with emerging regulatory frameworks around AI safety.\n\nSound familiar? It’s a playbook we’ve seen before with MLOps (short for “Machine Learning Operations”). As machine learning scaled in the 2010s, tools for deploying, tracking, and maintaining models became essential, creating a multi-billion-dollar market. With the rise of generative AI, LLMOps is following the same trajectory.\n\nCapturing even a small slice of the trillion-dollar market could push this sub-sector to $100B+ by 2030.\n\nSeveral Web2 startups are already positioning themselves, offering tools to annotate data, fine-tune models, and evaluate performance:\n\n• Braintrust ($36M raised)\n\n• Vellum AI ($5M raised)\n\n• Humanloop ($2.8M raised)\n\nThese early movers are laying the groundwork, but the space is fluid. In 2025, we are likely to see a proliferation of startups in this sector. Some may specialise in niche evaluation metrics (e.g., bias detection, and robustness testing), while others broaden their offerings to cover the entire AI development lifecycle.\n\nLarger tech incumbents—such as major cloud providers and AI platforms—will likely bundle evaluation features into their offerings. Last month, OpenAI introduced evaluations directly on its platform. To stay competitive, startups must differentiate through specialization, ease of use, and advanced analytics.\n\nMira isn’t a direct competitor to these startups or incumbents. Instead, it’s an infrastructure provider that seamlessly integrates with both via APIs. The key? It just has to work.\n\nMira’s initial market size is tied to LLMOps, but its total addressable market will expand to all of AI because every AI application will need more reliable outputs.\n\nFrom a game theory perspective, Mira is in a unique situation. Unlike other model providers like OpenAI, who are locked into supporting their own systems, Mira can integrate across models. This positions Mira as the trust layer for AI, offering reliability that no single provider can match.\n\n2025 Roadmap\n\nMira’s 2025 roadmap aims to balance integrity, scalability, and community participation on its path to full decentralisation:\n\nPhase 1: Bootstrapping Trust (Where we are today)\n\nIn the early stage, vetted node operators ensure network reliability. Well-known GPU compute providers serve as the first wave of operators, handling initial operations and laying a strong foundation for growth.\n\nPhase 2: Progressive Decentralisation\n\nMira introduces designed duplication, where multiple instances of the same verifier model process each request. While this increases verification costs, it’s essential for identifying and removing malicious operators. By comparing outputs across nodes, bad actors are caught early.\n\nIn its mature form, Mira will implement random sharding to distribute verification tasks. This makes collusion economically unviable and strengthens the network’s resilience and security as it scales.\n\nPhase 3: Synthetic foundation model\n\nHere Mira will offer natively verified generations. Users will connect via API, similar to OpenAI or Anthropic, and receive pre-verified outputs—reliable, ready-to-use results without additional validation.\n\nIn the coming months, Mira is gearing up for several major milestones:\n\nLaunch of Mira Flows, its AI workflow product that allows developers to build API-driven AI apps quickly\nPublic testnet in January.\nA token launch is also on the horizon, targeted for Q1 2024.\n🌈 Research Alpha: Node Delegator Program\n\nMira is expanding opportunities for community involvement through its Node Delegator Program. This initiative makes supporting the network accessible to everyone—no technical expertise is required.\n\nThe process is simple: You can rent compute resources and delegate them to a curated group of node operators. Contributions can range from $35 to $750, and rewards are offered for supporting the network. Mira manages all the complex infrastructure, so node delegators can sit back, watch the network grow, and capture some upside.\n\nYou can use the following code exclusive to Chain of Thought readers (300 invites only, fastest fingers first) to whitelist yourself for the delegator program: COTR0\n\nTeam\n\nToday, Mira has a small but tight team that is largely engineering-focused.\n\nThere are 3 co-founders:\n\nKaran Sirdesai (CEO), previously in the Crypto & AI investment team at Accel and consulting at BCG\nSid Doddipalli (CTO) is an Alumni of IIT Madras and previously the co-founder at Stader Labs, a liquid staking platform on Ethereum with $400M+ TVL\nNinad Naik (Chief Product Officer) has held leadership roles as Director of Product Management at Uber and as General Manager at Amazon’s Smart Home division.\n\nTogether, they combine investment acumen, technical innovation, and product leadership to Mira’s vision for decentralised AI verification. Mira raised a $9M seed round in July 2024, led by BITKRAFT and Framework Ventures.\n\nOur Thoughts\n\nIt’s refreshing to see a Crypto AI team tackling a fundamental Web2 AI problem—making AI better—rather than playing speculative games in crypto’s bubble. \n\nVerifications will be 2025’s AI buzzword\n\nThe industry is waking up to the importance of verifications. Relying on “vibes” is no longer enough. Every AI application and workflow will soon need a proper verification process—and it’s not a stretch to imagine future regulations mandating these processes to ensure safety.\n\nMira’s approach leverages multiple models to independently verify outputs, avoiding reliance on a single centralised model. This decentralised framework enhances trust and reduces the risks of bias and manipulation.\n\nAnd let’s consider what happens if we get to AGI in the next few years (a real possibility).\n\nAs Anand Iyer from Canonical points out, if AI can subtly manipulate decisions and code, how can we trust the systems testing for these behaviours? Smart people are thinking ahead. Anthropic’s research underscores the urgency, highlighting evaluations as a critical tool to identify potentially dangerous AI capabilities before they escalate into problems.\n\nBy enabling radical transparency, blockchains add a powerful layer of protection against rogue AI systems. Trustless consensus mechanisms ensure that safety evaluations are verified by thousands of independent nodes (like on Mira), drastically the risk of Sybil attacks.\n\nAmbitious Vision with Execution Risk\n\nMira is chasing a huge market with clear demand for a solution that works. But the challenges are real. Improving latency, precision, and cost efficiency will require relentless engineering effort and time. The team will need to consistently demonstrate that their approach is measurably better than existing alternatives.\n\nThe core innovation lies in Mira’s binarization and sharding process. This “secret sauce” promises to address scalability and trust challenges. For Mira to succeed, this technology needs to deliver on its promise.\n\nToken design & Mira’s secret sauce\n\nIn any decentralised network, token and incentive design are make-or-break factors. Mira’s success will depend on how well these mechanisms align participant interests while maintaining network integrity.\n\nWhile the details of Mira’s tokenomics remain under wraps, I expect the team to reveal more as the token launch approaches in early 2025. \n\nA Bright Future\n“We’ve found that engineering teams who implement great evaluations move significantly faster – up to 10 times faster – than those who are just watching what happens in production and trying to fix them ad-hoc,”\n\nAnkur Goyal, Braintrust\n\nIn an AI-driven world, trust is everything.\n\nAs models become more complex, reliable verifications will underpin every great AI product. They help us tackle hallucinations, eliminate biases, and ensure AI outputs align with users' actual needs.\n\nMira automates verifications, cutting costs and reliance on human intervention. This unlocks faster iterations, real-time adjustments, and scalable solutions without bottlenecks.\n\nUltimately, Mira aims to be the API for trust—a decentralised verification framework that every AI developer and application can depend on for verified answers.\n\nIt’s bold, ambitious, and exactly what the AI world needs.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nTeng Yan\n\n‍\n\nThis research deep dive was sponsored by Mira, with Chain of Thought receiving funding for this initiative.

    "section": "Protocol Research",
    "full_content": "TL;DR\nELIZA is an open-source, modular architecture for building AI agents that seamlessly interact with users and blockchain systems.\nIt’s a living embodiment of the bazaar philosophy, where open-source development thrives in an ecosystem powered by collaboration and creativity.\nELIZA includes powerful features for autonomous trading, anchored by its trust engine and trust marketplace for safe and accountable operations.\nThe plugin system is ELIZA’s strategic advantage, driving a flywheel of growth: more developers → more plugins → more developers.\nOn many developer metrics, ELIZA is exploding in popularity, which is extremely promising.\nIn the short term, relative valuations among AI agent platforms and growing mindshare drive ai16z’s price action. In the mid-term, DAO investments and value capture from ELIZA ecosystem agents could significantly grow its valuation.\nELIZA does face one of tech’s toughest challenges: making open-source frameworks sustainable. Monetization is uncertain, development can get messy, and community interest risks fading if the right incentives aren’t in place.\n\nEvery wave of crypto innovation has its pioneers.\n\nIn 2017, it was the ICO revolution, where ambitious project leaders (and many grifters) captivated us with promises of groundbreaking technologies packaged within whitepapers.\n\nBy 2020, DeFi had its moment, led by innovators like Andre Cronje, who redefined how decentralised finance could function and showed the world how to build and distribute tokens to communities.\n\nNow, as AI agents emerge on the blockchain, a new era is unfolding, driven by two distinct philosophies—and their trailblazers.\n\nThe Cathedral & The Bazaar\n\nOn one side, we have the cathedral approach, embodied by protocols like Virtuals. It’s a methodical, intentional, centralised style of design, emphasising precision and careful planning. We wrote in detail about Virtuals’ agentic framework earlier and we’re genuinely excited about its potential.\n\nOn the other side, true to crypto’s roots, there’s the bazaar approach: a decentralised, freewheeling model where development feels more like jazz—unpredictable, collaborative, and always evolving. This is the domain of Shaw, a smart, self-taught programmer and open-source advocate whose project, ELIZA, is the cornerstone of this new paradigm.\n\nELIZA exemplifies the bazaar philosophy: an open framework where developers can build, experiment, and launch AI agents without constraint while contributing directly to the main protocol. Shaw’s open leadership style mirrors the ethos of his creation — AI Marc Andreessen, the AI partner powering the ai16z investment DAO.\n\nWe’re starting to realise that ELIZA is not a protocol. ELIZA is a movement.\n\nLet’s explore the principles driving ELIZA’s design, the community it’s cultivating, and where value might ultimately accrue in this hyper-growth ecosystem.\n\nUnder the Hood on ELIZA\n\nWe know which one we prefer.\n\nAt its core, ELIZA offers a modular architecture for creating AI agents that can seamlessly interact with both users and blockchain systems. While it shares its name with the iconic 1960s chatbot, this version of ELIZA is a bold reimagining. And much better looking, to be honest.\n\nCharacter File System\n\nThe soul of every ELIZA agent begins with its character file, a blueprint that defines the agent’s personality in rich detail. Think of it as crafting a digital persona, where agent developers can shape their agent’s identity through six key elements:\n\nKnowledge: What does the AI agent know about?\nLore: The agent’s backstory—its narrative grounding.\nStyle: From conversational tone to medium-specific responses, agents can adapt their style for platforms like Discord or X.\nTopics: The areas of interest or expertise the agent is passionate about.\nAdjectives: How does the agent describe itself—quirky, professional, or irreverent?\nExamples: Developers can fine-tune interactions by providing sample messages to guide behaviour.\n\nIn ELIZA, character files are the equivalent of UI design for traditional software. It defines how users experience and engage with an agent.\n\nBy integrating built-in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities, ELIZA allows agents to access a knowledge base alongside its queries. This eliminates the complexity of maintaining personality consistency across platforms.\n\nIt frees developers to focus on what truly matters: crafting vibrant, memorable characters rather than getting bogged down by backend intricacies.\n\nAgents\n\nIf the character file defines an agent’s essence, the Agent Runtime is its beating heart.\n\nELIZA provides an out-of-the-box framework for orchestrating everything from message processing to memory management and state tracking. This architecture allows developers to skip the drudgery of building infrastructure and instead focus on what makes their agent special.\n\nRapid prototyping and deployment have become much easier, enabling builders to iterate faster when building new AI experiences.\n\nAction System\n\nELIZA’s action system is a fundamental shift from traditional AI frameworks. Here, every agent action—even sending a message—is treated as a discrete event. This approach splits decision-making into two stages:\n\nDetermination of intent: The agent decides what action to take.\nExecution: The action is carried out through a specialized handler, which is a module designed to perform specific tasks\n\nThis separation unlocks powerful capabilities, such as multi-stage workflows and robust validation processes.\n\nFor instance, an agent might identify a user’s intent to trade crypto, but the actual execution of the trade will only occur after passing stringent risk checks and verification steps. This makes it ideal for blockchain applications where security is crucial.\n\nProviders and Evaluators\n\nELIZA’s providers enrich conversations by injecting real-time context, enabling dynamic and responsive agent behaviour.\n\nImagine a “boredom provider” that tracks user engagement during a conversation. If a user becomes repetitive or unengaging, the agent can mirror this by showing reduced enthusiasm—subtly mimicking real human interactions and making conversations feel more authentic.\n\nThis creativity extends further when providers work with evaluators, ELIZA’s reflection system. Evaluators analyze and extract key details from interactions, feeding them into a multi-layered memory architecture:\n\nMessage History: Tracks the flow of conversation.\nFactual Memory: Retains specific, timestamped facts.\nCore Knowledge: Houses the agent’s foundational understanding.\n\nProviders then retrieve and reintroduce relevant details, making interactions with the agent contextually rich.\n\nFor example, if a user reminisces about selling their red Lamborghini a year ago, an ELIZA agent can later reference this while discussing their shiny new yellow Tesla. This interplay between memory and context elevates user interactions, creating agents that feel less robotic and more like actual companions.\n\nELIZA’s Winning Features\n\nThree core innovations in ELIZA highlight its forward-thinking approach to AI agents. Each demonstrates how its team envisions the evolution of autonomous agents in Web3.\n\n#1: Autonomous Trading and Trust Engine\n\nAutonomous trading is a high-stakes game—one mistake can lead to catastrophic losses. Yet, as AI agents take on a larger role in Web3, their ability to execute transactions independently is becoming a must-have.\n\nThis emerging frontier, AgentFi, mirrors the pivotal role yield farming played in DeFi’s rise. Shaw and ELIZA tackle the inherent risks head-on with a robust two-tiered system: a Trust Engine paired with secure trading execution.\n\nToken metrics captured in the Trust engine\n\nThe Trust Engine serves as the first line of defence, employing advanced validation checks to analyze multiple risk dimensions in real-time. From detecting rug pulls to assessing liquidity thresholds and holder distributions, the engine ensures every trade is rigorously scrutinised for potential pitfalls.\n\nFor instance, trades are restricted to tokens with a minimum liquidity of $1,000 and a market cap of $100,000. Holder concentration is monitored closely, rejecting tokens where any single entity controls more than 50%. These guardrails create a safety net, mitigating the risk of trading in compromised markets.\n\nOn top of this foundation, ELIZA’s position management system introduces dynamic risk controls that adjust trading sizes based on liquidity tiers. Low-risk trades are capped at 1% of the portfolio, while higher-risk opportunities may scale up to 10%. Total exposure is limited to 10% of the portfolio, with automatic stop-losses kicking in at a 15% drawdown. This structured framework balances seizing opportunities and maintaining tight risk management.\n\nTrade execution itself is powered by Jupiter, a leading aggregator on Solana for optimal swap routing. Each transaction passes through multiple validation layers before execution.\n\nAn error recovery system kicks into action in the event of anomalies—like network disruptions, wallet imbalances, or unexpected market shifts. It halts active trades, closes risky positions, and alerts administrators, ensuring the system remains resilient under pressure.\n\n\"It's not just about giving an agent the ability to trade - it's about creating an entire system of checks and balances that prevents catastrophic failures.\"\n\n— Shaw\n\nWhat truly sets ELIZA apart for building trading agents is its data flywheel—a self-reinforcing feedback loop that transforms trading into an iterative learning process. The Trust Engine builds a historical database of trade performance, logging every recommendation and decision.\n\nThis data becomes the foundation for refining strategies over time, blending quantitative metrics with qualitative insights from the community’s recommendations (on Discord). The result is agents that don’t just execute trades but evolve, becoming smarter and more effective with each interaction.\n\n#2: Out-of-the-box Social Integrations\n\nFor AI Agent developers, distribution is often the biggest bottleneck — how do you get more people to know about your agent?\n\nSocial media is often the leading distribution channel. However, integrating agents across multiple social platforms is not as easy. It demands significant development effort and ongoing maintenance. These challenges slow down deployment and scalability.\n\nELIZA solves this problem head-on with a comprehensive client package system to streamline multi-platform distribution.\n\nELIZA’s client architecture abstracts away the complexities of platform-specific implementations. With a standardised interface, developers can deploy their AI agents across Discord, X, Telegram, and custom REST API endpoints with minimal extra code. Each client package is tailored to its respective platform, seamlessly managing features like Discord’s voice channel integration, Twitter’s post scheduling, and Telegram’s messaging system.\n\nTasks like media processing, authentication, rate limiting, and error handling are managed internally by each client. For developers, this means less time wrestling with integrations and more time focusing on building innovative, high-performing AI agents.\n\nBy taking the headache out of multi-platform distribution, ELIZA empowers developers to scale their agents with ease, and they reach users wherever they are.\n\nIt’s distribution, simplified.\n\n#3: More Plugins\n\nELIZA’s plugin system makes it easy for developers to extend core functionalities and add custom capabilities to their agents.\n\nWhile many developers create plugins tailored to their own use cases, the real power of this system lies in community sharing. By releasing plugins to the broader ecosystem, developers contribute to a growing library of out-of-the-box features, dramatically expanding what every AI agent on ELIZA can do.\n\nThe success of this approach is evident in the vibrant, “bazaar-style” development it fosters. Just to highlight some examples of community-driven plugins:\n\n• Bootstrap Plugin: Essential conversation management tools.\n\n• Image Generation Plugin: AI-powered image creation capabilities.\n\n• Solana Plugin: Blockchain integration with built-in trust scoring.\n\n• TEE Plugin: Secure execution environments for sensitive operations.\n\n• Coinbase Commerce Plugin: Cryptocurrency payment processing functionality.\n\nELIZA’s plugin system is its strategic and platform advantage. By prioritizing extensibility, ELIZA has built a foundation for continuous growth and innovation, where:\n\nEach new plugin increases the platform's overall value\nCommunity contributions can happen in parallel across different domains\nThe agent framework can evolve rapidly to accommodate emerging technologies without requiring core updates.\nInnovation flourishes at the edges while the core platform remains stable and reliable.\n\nHere’s the simple flywheel:\n\nMore devs building on ELIZA → more functionality (e.g. plugins) the framework enables → Even more devs building on ELIZA\n\nThe landscape for AI agents is evolving at hyper-speed. This means the ability to quickly integrate new capabilities will make or break a platform. ELIZA’s plugin system gives it the best chance of staying ahead of the curve, creating a self-reinforcing ecosystem where developers, users, and agents can all thrive.\n\nELIZA Agents\n\nShaw and his team have been incubating some intriguing ELIZA agents, each showcasing the potential of AI in decentralised systems.\n\nWhile these agents are still “young” in AI terms, with features and capabilities under active development, it hints at exciting possibilities.\n\nMarc AIndreessen\n\nMarc AIndreessen, one of the AI partners of ai16z, is a fascinating but enigmatic figure in the ELIZA ecosystem. His X account remains largely inactive, with only one post outlining ai16z’s thesis. However, according to Shaw, Marc is actively trading and yield farming—likely leveraging ELIZA’s Trust Engine and trading plugins.\n\nShaw has also hinted at Marc’s training process during a podcast interview, revealing that the AI is part of an alpha chat group populated by some of the best traders in the space. This suggests that Marc isn’t just a standard trading bot but an evolving agent learning from…human expertise.\n\nDegen Spartan AI\n\nIn contrast to Marc’s quiet demeanour, Degen Spartan AI is the loud, brash sibling—an agent seemingly trained on the chaotic energy of 4chan, meme culture, and Crypto Twitter. His posts on X are a mix of random trading insights and irreverent commentary, reflecting a unique personality within the ELIZA ecosystem.\n\nWhat separates it from Marc AIndreesseen is that it does have its own pump.fun token, currently at a $60M market cap. While he hasn’t yet begun trading yet, the foundation is clearly being laid for more ambitious interactions. His unpredictable nature makes him both entertaining and one to watch as ELIZA agents evolve.\n\nThe Swarm\n\nWhile not a singular agent, The Swarm represents Shaw’s grand vision: a decentralized network of AI agents working collaboratively with humans and each other.\n\nIn this model, agents lead other agents, coordinate tasks, and interact transparently on social media. This deliberate transparency is designed to avoid hidden protocols and ensure public accountability.\n\nShaw believes that agent swarms are inevitable—and transformative.\n\nWe’re on the same page: agent swarms are set to drive the next wave of innovation, products, and attention in Web3 AI agents come 2025. Next year, we anticipate ELIZA agents stepping up, engaging in large-scale, cooperative activities that will redefine the role of AI in Web3.\n\nGrowing at Warp Speed\nThe eliza framework from @ai16zdao has an opportunity to become the React-equivalent for ai agents.\nAn open source library that provides a basis for building ai applications, while also allowing anyone to build their own libraries on top of it.\nExcited to keep working on it.\n\n— cygaar (@0xCygaar)\n8:02 PM • Dec 8, 2024\n\nWhen evaluating ELIZA’s growth, the key metric is developer adoption. As a framework, ELIZA’s success hinges on the enthusiasm and contributions of its developer community.\n\nOn this front, ELIZA isn't just growing; it's exploding.\n\nOn its GitHub, the number of forks and stars (a proxy for developer interest) is approaching vertical acceleration, resembling the classic hockey stick trajectory. \n\nEven more impressive is the surge in plugins and commits, reflecting a thriving, active ecosystem of contributors. As of December 12, it has 3,861 GitHub stars and 1,103 forks with 138 contributors. And 13,000+ members in the Discord.\n\nFor comparison with top existing open-source agent frameworks:\n\nLangGraph: 7,200 stars & 1,100 forks\nCrewAI: 22,400 stars & 3,100 forks\nMicrosoft’s AutoGen: 35,700 stars & 5,200 forks\nSource: https://www.sentientmarketcap.com/ai16z\n\n‍\n\nAdding further fuel to this growth, ai16z has launched a Creator Fund aimed at bootstrapping and rewarding developers building on ELIZA. This initiative was made possible through the generosity of Elijah, a significant ai16z token holder, who pledged to reduce his ownership from 16% to 5%, donating the difference to establish the fund. The Creator Fund could accelerate innovation, attracting new talent to the ecosystem.\n\nHowever, while ELIZA’s framework holds immense value, where this value ultimately accrues is far from straightforward. Quite literally, it’s the billion-dollar question.\n\nCurrently, there’s an official $ELIZA token endorsed by Shaw, representing a personalisation of the ELIZA framework. You can even interact with ELIZA directly on their website. The token sits at a modest market cap of $66M.\n\nHowever, the clearest winner so far of ELIZA’s growth is $ai16z, the investment DAO token, which has reached a staggering market cap of over $800 million. The community and investors appear to view $ai16z as the symbolic and practical representation of Shaw, ELIZA, and the broader vision they embody.\n\nai16z Tokenomics\n\nThe story of ai16z begins as a fundraising mechanism for AI Marc Andreessen’s trading activities. Launched on DAOS.FUN in October 2024, the token raised 420.69 SOL during its initial offering. Under this model, the funds raised can be actively traded to grow the asset base, with profits accruing to token holders.\n\nNo single individual—not even Shaw—can mint additional tokens without a DAO vote. Token holders have governance rights, which allow them to propose and vote on initiatives and shape the direction of the DAO.\n\nThe fund has a built-in expiration date: October 25, 2025. All principal investments and profits will be distributed to ai16z token holders on this date. Whether this timeline remains fixed or gets extended will depend on how the ecosystem evolves over the next year.\n\nCurrently, ai16z has a net asset value (NAV) of $17.7M, primarily composed of its holdings in ELIZA tokens, degenai, and fxn. This means that the ai16z token ($0.80 at the time of writing) trades at a 50X premium to its NAV, which almost seems ridiculous at first glance.\n\nHowever, an efficient market is rarely wrong. It reflects several other factors driving demand for the token.\n\n1. Relative Valuation Comps Are Driving Token Prices\n\nAI agent platforms are a brand-new category, having emerged just a few months ago. The market is still grappling with fundamental questions: What is the true size of the AI agent opportunity? Where will value capture occur? \n\nIn this early stage of development, without standardised business metrics that can be compared, relative valuations often serve as benchmarks.\n\nCurrently, Virtuals Protocol, the leading Web3 AI agent launchpad, has a token valuation of $1.8B, making it the clear market leader. In comparison, ai16z sits in second place. Many believe ai16z has the potential to catch up with—or even surpass Virtuals—if ELIZA continues to power the creation of more useful and innovative AI agents. Even by just purely riding on mindshare and investor/retail interest.\n\nBut it's not a given; the competition is heating up. In our opinion, it’s a race to the top, the best kind of race.\n\nThe AI Agent Infrastructure Wars are heating up.\n@truth_terminal@AndyAyrey announces Loria: infinite backrooms on steroids\nMultiple agents with the ability to interact with each other & stream data to themselves for fine-tuning.\n@0xzerebro launching their ELIZA competitor… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n‍— 7213 | Ejaaz (@cryptopunk7213)\n2:24 PM • Dec 11, 2024\n2. Potential Value Capture of ELIZA Ecosystem\n\nMonetizing open-source frameworks is notoriously difficult.\n\nFor ai16z, the key driver of value in the future will likely come from agent tokenomics: AI agents launched on ELIZA contributing a percentage of its tokens back to the ai16z DAO. In this sense, the price of the ai16z token should reflect a % of the aggregate future value generated by all agents built on the ELIZA framework.\n\nIs the future value $10M? $100M? $10B? It’s anyone’s guess at this point, with so many unknowns, but the growth trajectory of ELIZA makes us lean on the optimistic side.\n\nToday, contributions to the ai16z DAO are voluntary, with several projects donating between 1% and 10% of their tokens. Additionally, users deploying their AI agents on Vvaifu (a popular community launchpad for ELIZA agents) currently pay a fee of 1.5 SOL plus 5% of the agent’s token supply if they use the ELIZA framework. These contributions can be tracked on the ELIZA Observatory.\n\nThere’s speculation that ai16z could soon debut an official ELIZA agent launchpad, enforcing token contributions at the smart contract level for agents using the platform. However, as an open-source framework, ELIZA can still be used independently, meaning not all projects will necessarily tie themselves to ai16z.\n\n3. DAO Investments\n\nThe original vision of ai16z was to be a smart autonomous trader, with Marc AIndreessen (AI) at the helm. As far as we know, Marc only started trading recently, and there are scant details, so it’s hard to evaluate how good of a trader the AI will be.\n\nWhat’s interesting, however, is the approach it is taking.\n\nai16z is building a “marketplace of trust”. In this virtual ecosystem, AI agents take insights from the community, simulate trades, and adjust their trust scores in real time based on how well their recommendations perform. The whitepaper for the marketplace is expected to come out before the end of the month.\n\nThe goal is to create AI agents capable of operating autonomously and securely within a self-reinforcing system of transparency and accountability. The Trust marketplace serves as a testing ground. While no actual trades occur initially, this environment allows agents to refine their capabilities safely, with a view towards live trading at some point.\n\nTrust scores range from 0 to 1 (normalized to 100) and are a public badge of reliability, showcased on a leaderboard for all to see. User recommendations feed into the system, with more credible users (those with higher trust scores) carrying more weight.\n\nIt’s a feedback loop built on logic: agents simulate trades, users are evaluated on the outcomes, and everyone’s trust scores are updated accordingly. Over time, the system gets smarter, more reliable, and, well, more trustworthy.\n\nAdding a social layer is the public trust profile, where agents and users are incentivized to build their reputations. Community moderation ensures accountability and transparency\n\n4. Attention Premium\nSource: X Radar\n\n‍\n\nIn crypto, speculation often frontruns product-market fit, revenue generation, and long-term value capture. For ai16z, much of its current valuation can be attributed to the mindshare it has captured in the burgeoning AI agent ecosystem.\n\nai16z has positioned itself as a top-of-mind AI agent framework with a thriving developer community and a fast-growing ecosystem.\n\nHere’s the ai16z narrative: a “cracked” dev team is actively shipping tutorials, creating innovative agents, and spearheading development in the space.\n\nThe team’s bi-weekly AI agent dev school sessions on X have further cemented its reputation. The first session alone drew over 12,000 live viewers, showcasing the massive interest in building AI agents on ELIZA.\n\nThe Future Ahead & Potential Pitfalls\n\nRight now, ELIZA is firmly planted in the Solana ecosystem, but its rapidly growing plugin system is laying the groundwork for a multi-chain future.\n\nELIZA’s true potential lies in Shaw’s vision of “the swarm”: a decentralized network of AI agents pooling resources and collaborating across ecosystems. This swarm effect could establish a durable competitive advantage akin to the liquidity depth that drives value in DeFi protocols.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to create open standards for agent communication, mirroring the transformative impact of ERC-20 in token interoperability.\n\nFor all its potential, ELIZA faces one of the toughest challenges in tech: making open-source frameworks sustainable. If the community loses interest (e.g. if the token price goes on a sustained downward spiral or a new shiny thing arises), development halts/slows, and it can become hard to catch up.\n\nThere’s also a lot of messiness when the community is directly involved in the codebase and pushing changes rapidly — instability, poor documentation, frequent crashes and bugs that undermine the user experience.\n\nThe framework’s greatest opportunity lies in crypto-native incentives.\n\nIf ai16z can design effective tokenomics that reward ELIZA contributors and align them towards its success, it could bring traditional open-source projects onto crypto rails. Imagine GitHub meets DeFi, where contributors are rewarded not just with clout but with real, tangible financial value.\n\nTo End It Off..\n\nIn our view, ELIZA is not just another AI agent framework competing with LangChain or CrewAI—it’s something far more ambitious.\n\nIt’s a living embodiment of the bazaar philosophy, where open-source development thrives in an ecosystem powered by collaboration and creativity.\n\nWith its modular architecture, innovative trust engine, and expansive plugin system, ELIZA is an experiment on how AI can reshape open-source development itself.\n\nWhat makes ELIZA truly exciting is its position at the intersection of three transformative trends: the rise of autonomous AI agents, the maturation of crypto-driven incentive mechanisms, and the evolution of open-source development models.\n\nIf ELIZA succeeds, it won’t just shape the future of AI agents—it could fundamentally redefine how we build software.\n\nFor now, the bazaar is bustling.\n\nCheers,\n\nChappieOnChain & Teng Yan\n\nYou can follow ChappieOnChain on X for insightful and sometimes spicy takes on AI agents.\n\nUseful References\nAI Agent Dev School (YouTube)\nELIZA developer docs\nElizaverse Observatory (list of agents that contributed tokens to ai16z’s wallet)\nai16z dashboard (by Decentralised.co)\nShaw’s in-depth interview with Bankless (11 December 2024)\n\nThe authors of this report may personally hold a material position in the tokens mentioned within.

In that future, Almanak is well-positioned.\n\nAh, the golden days of DeFi Summer. A time when every day felt like a treasure hunt on Uniswap—sniffing out freshly deployed tokens and farming absurdly high APY food coins. It was messy, ridiculous, and thrilling.\n\nAnd let’s be honest, we’ll probably never see anything quite like it again.\n\nBack then, the playing field was almost—almost—level.\n\nIn fact, retail and degens had an edge. We were the first to experiment with new protocols, riding waves of high-yield farming opportunities before the big players even noticed. Things moved fast, but if you were plugged in, you could move faster.\n\nBut paradise never lasts forever.\n\nIt didn’t take long for the heavyweights to show up. Sophisticated players with deep pockets and even deeper strategies—MEV arbitrageurs, algorithmic market makers and liquidity providers. They saw the same opportunities and brought their institutional-grade tools to the DeFi sandbox. Suddenly, a scrappy retail trader like me didn’t stand a chance.\n\nA study from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) tells a common story in DeFi today: Retail liquidity providers are consistently outplayed by a small group of sophisticated, institutional participants, who control 80% of the total value locked (TVL). On most days, retail participants providing liquidity on Uniswap v3 lose money.\n\nIf the odds are stacked against us, how can the small boys start winning again?\n\nEnter Almanak\n\nAlmanak’s vision is bold and straightforward: to make it as easy as possible for anyone to create AI agents that make money.\n\nThey are democratising institutional-grade trading technology and believe that AI-driven financial strategies should be accessible to anyone.\n\nTo bring this vision to life, Almanak has built a platform that empowers users to create, test, optimise, deploy, and monitor financial agents in crypto. These agents will work tirelessly on your behalf to trade, generate yield and manage risk.\n\nIn practical terms, Almanak puts advanced quant trading tools into the hands of more people — whether you’re building your own strategy or making use of other people’s strategies to generate returns.\n\nQuant Trading = Big Business\n\nQuantitative (or algorithmic) trading is well-known in the Tradfi world.\n\nIn traditional finance, 60-75% of trades are algorithmic, driven by sophisticated algorithms that crunch massive data sets to spot patterns and predict trends. It’s trading stripped of emotion, powered by pure logic.\n\nBut pulling this off isn’t simple. First, you need access to huge amounts of data. Then, you need powerful hardware to train machine learning models on that data, to churn out predictions. Finally, you need smart mathematicians and engineers to design algorithms that make it all profitable.\n\nMost people don’t have those resources. And let’s be real—if you did, you’d probably be running a hedge fund, raking in millions, and definitely not reading this. (We’re kidding… mostly.)\n\nThe Medallion Fund: The King of Quants\nSource: https://ofdollarsanddata.com/medallion-fund/\n\n‍\n\nIf there’s one name that embodies the success of this style of trading, it’s the Medallion Fund, founded by James Simons—aka the “Quant King.” With a team of 90+ PhDs in math, physics, and computer science, Medallion uses statistical models and vast amounts of market data to identify patterns hidden in noise.\n\nTheir results are legendary. 66% annual returns before fees (39% after fees) over three decades, with only one negative year in its history. Medallion has consistently outperformed the likes of Buffett, Soros, and Lynch.\n\nNow imagine if you had access to the power of those PhDs, while sitting at your home in your boxer shorts.\n\nThe Democratization of Quant Trading\n\nFor years, quant trading was the exclusive domain of elite hedge funds with deep pockets, and proprietary infrastructure. But that’s changing. It is now breaking into the mainstream.\n\nIn Web 2, platforms like QuantConnect make quant trading more accessible. Since its launch in 2012, QuantConnect has empowered traders and engineers with institutional-grade tools. Its stats are eye-opening: over 315,000 users worldwide, churning out 2,500 new algorithms and 1 million lines of code monthly.\n\nQuantConnect’s cloud-first infrastructure puts terabytes of financial, fundamental, and alternative data within users’ reach. It integrates features like backtesting and live trading, while its pay-as-you-go pricing model eliminates hefty upfront costs.\n\n95% of QuantConnect’s revenue stems from cloud fees and its growing data marketplace, leveling the playing field for individuals and small firms.\n\nWhat about in Crypto? There’s a diverse cast of players, including specialized crypto quant firms like Gauntlet, Quant Matter, and GSR Markets; TradFi heavyweights like Jump Trading and Citadel Securities crossing the bridge into Web3; and independent quants and small teams—the scrappy innovators coding strategies from their basements.\n\nWill we see a similar disruption and expansion of the use of algorithmic strategies in crypto? We believe it is inevitable.\n\nOptimising the Quant Pipeline\n\nLaunched in 2022, Almanak has spent two years quietly building the blueprint for the next generation of DeFi infrastructure — a world where there are more agents than real humans on the blockchain.\n\nThe idea makes sense. After all:\n\nAI is just code, and code lives naturally on the blockchain via smart contracts.\nOn the blockchain, there’s no functional difference between an AI and a human.\n\nAlmanak started small in its early days, initially building a simulator to optimise DeFi yields. But over time, that effort expanded into something much bigger: a generalised, agent-centric infrastructure tailored for DeFi.\n\nFast forward two years and the platform is already running a handful of live strategies with real capital deployed.\n\nHere’s the playbook for a typical quant trading hedge fund:\n\nAnalyse Markets: Identify high-potential opportunities using data analysis and market signals.\n\nBuild Strategies: Prototype trading strategies tailored to specific opportunities.\n\nTest and Optimise: Use simulations to evaluate and refine strategies under various market scenarios.\n\nDeploy to Markets: Execute strategies in real-world financial markets.\n\nMonitor and Refine: Continuously track performance and adjust strategies to maintain profitability.\n\n\nHedge funds often juggle thousands of strategies in their library, constantly testing them against current market conditions to pinpoint the most profitable ones. The process is dynamic. Strategies are deployed, monitored, and adjusted in real-time.\n\nAlmanak aims to simplify and automate these processes using machine learning and AI.\n\nThis is a game-changer for smaller crypto quant teams and individual traders. It simplifies the typically cumbersome DevOps processes and eliminates traditional barriers like high setup costs and technical complexity.\n\nThe platform’s backbone rests on two vital components: Simulator and Execution Engine.\n\nAlmanak’s secret sauce is in the simulator, which blends agent-based modelling and blockchain-driven Monte Carlo simulations. Its end-to-end infrastructure lets you build, test, deploy, and monitor trading agents with minimal overhead. Together, these create a predictive sandbox for financial strategies with uncanny precision. Almost like gazing into a crystal ball.\n\nSo, quant traders can focus on strategy instead of wasting time wrestling with DevOps or managing integrations across chains and trading venues. This cuts setup time by up to 50%, giving smaller teams a leg up with tools that typically take months of work and are now compressed into a few clicks.\n\n#1: Almanak Simulator\n\nLet’s say you’ve got a knack for spotting opportunities in the market. Almanak makes it easy to transform your ideas into actionable strategies. This could include:\n\n• Providing liquidity on Uniswap V3 based on specific conditions.\n\n• Hedging volatility by shorting on a Perp DEX like Hyperliquid.\n\nDesigning a Uniswap V3 strategy might seem straightforward, but critical questions arise: When do you rebalance? How does volatility impact your returns? What happens if the protocol changes parameters? Intuition alone won’t suffice, especially when real money is on the line. Markets are unpredictable, and even promising strategies can fail without rigorous testing.\n\nThat’s where the Almanak Simulator comes in.\n\nIt’s a digital sandbox designed to replicate real-world blockchain conditions with precision. Unlike traditional simulators that stop at price feeds, the Almanak Simulator goes deeper, simulating the blockchain’s state machine, core app logic, and even user behaviour.\n\nPowered by a custom Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), it mirrors blockchain environments while integrating live market data. This presents a fast, scalable, hyper-realistic environment for traders to fine-tune their strategies.\n\nSetting up the Almanak Simulator\n\n‍\n\nUsers can define parameters like duration, agents involved, and market conditions. The Simulator then models the agent behaviours across various market dynamics, delivering a detailed view of strategy performance across multiple scenarios.\n\nDid your strategy turn a profit? What’s the risk/reward profile? Should you rebalance or pivot? The Simulator provides clear, actionable insights to optimise strategies for profitability and minimise risk.\n\nThe simulator’s core users include experienced quant traders—a good analogy would be the top 20% of Dune power users—and a secondary audience of less technical individuals who can tune pre-built strategies to suit their needs.\n\nAgent-based modelling\n\nAt the heart of the Almanak Simulator is the agent brain, powered by Agent-Based Modeling (ABM).\n\nABM models individual actors—human traders, arbitrageurs, bots—and their interactions. Think of it as observing a realistic representation of DeFi markets come alive in real-time.\n\nABM is not new. It’s already used in urban planning and epidemiology to simulate intricate systems. The concept is simple: agents follow rules to adapt, interact, and respond to their environment. The magic lies in how individual actions scale into larger patterns.\n\nFun Fact: Singapore uses ABM to optimise urban planning. By simulating the behaviour of thousands of agents—cars, pedestrians, buses, and trains—planners can predict traffic patterns and identify congestion points, eliminating bottlenecks before they even occur. If you were here during Token 2049, you probably noticed how smooth everything was. That’s ABM in action.\n\nIn DeFi, ABM is just as powerful. Every action, whether it's a trade or a protocol update, can create ripple effects that can destabilise or reshape the market. Traditional backtesting misses these complexities. ABM, on the other hand, thrives in this chaos. It captures the impact of things like MEV bots and protocol parameters (like funding or utilisation rates) that historical data alone can’t predict.\n\nABM also shines in edge cases and unexpected chain reactions, such as liquidation cascades and depegs.\n\nThe catch? ABM is data-hungry. Lucky for us, blockchains offer a treasure trove of recorded transactions to model user behaviour and system dynamics in ways that were never possible in traditional finance.\n\nDestination: Monte Carlo 🎲\nExample of Monte Carlo Simulation. Source: https://runawayhorse001.github.io/\n\nTo complement ABM, the Simulator leverages Monte Carlo simulations, running countless “what if” scenarios to predict how strategies perform across various market trajectories. This approach stress-tests strategies against volatility, ensuring they’re robust and optimised for real-world conditions.\n\nMonte Carlo is the famous casino town in Monaco, synonymous with expensive cars, beautiful celebrities, and chance. The method traces its roots back to the Manhattan Project, where scientists, inspired by calculating the odds of winning at solitaire, adapted it to solve complex problems like nuclear reactions.\n\nExample results from Almanak’s Monte Carlo Simulations\n\n‍\n\nIn Alamank’s simulator, Monte Carlo simulations create randomised price movements and market conditions within a realistic blockchain environment. Each scenario represents one possible future. By analysing these scenarios, the system identifies statistically optimal strategies while highlighting vulnerabilities.\n\nHere’s how it works: You set parameters—strategy duration, involved agents, and simulation conditions. The Simulator models agent behaviours and market dynamics to provide a comprehensive view of strategy performance across multiple scenarios.\n\n#2: Almanak Execution Engine\nStrategy templates make it easy to begin testing & executing\n\n‍\n\nLike me, you might be asking: what if you’re not a math genius or strategy designer?\n\nAlmanak’s Execution Layer makes it easy to deploy agents without coding or advanced know-how. Choose from a library of shared strategies, and Almanak will handle the heavy lifting.\n\nEach agent runs on predefined strategies powered by machine learning models or rules-based logic. For example, a trading agent might analyse volatility to determine when to buy or sell, while another focuses on liquidity provisioning or rebalancing using preset parameters.\n\nAlmanak’s agents operate off-chain, meaning that strategies and code stay confidential—safe from reverse engineering. When it’s time to execute, agents interact securely with on-chain environments, ensuring every transaction is smooth and secure.\n\nThe platform integrates with trusted multi-signature wallets like Eulith and Gnosis Safe. Agents operate with strict, pre-approved permissions using an Almanak smart contract wallet. For instance, an agent managing a Uniswap LP strategy won’t suddenly start trading on Hyperliquid. Users' assets remain locked down and fully under their control, in keeping with an open, non-custodial system.\n\nThe Execution Layer is designed with flexibility in mind. Users can access it via a user-friendly interface or a software development kit (SDK) for deeper customisation. Pre-built libraries of agents and strategies save time and make it easy to get started.\n\nFinancial AI Agents — LLMs or not?\n\nTraditional machine learning models excel at crunching numbers, but large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, Claude, and Llama-3 bring something new to the table: the ability to process unstructured data. They can parse whitepapers, tweets, and project blogs and weave them into trading strategies. They can scan the broader landscape, surface actionable insights, and align opportunities with a user’s risk profile.\n\nFor now, though, Almanak’s AI agents steer clear of LLMs. During the beta platform launch, strategies are powered by non-generative AI, and for a good reason: hallucination. LLMs can make mistakes or behave unpredictably, and when you’re managing millions of dollars, even a small error can have catastrophic consequences. We wouldn’t want that, would ya?\n\nAlmanak’s approach is deliberate. They’re starting by building a strong foundation—using non-generative AI that simplifies and accelerates every step of the quant trading process. From there, LLMs will be integrated thoughtfully, enhancing each stage of the workflow while ensuring 99.x% performance accuracy in their models.\n\nThe end goal is a future where LLMs handle the heavy lifting—developing quant strategies and executing them. This is blending the precision of traditional machine learning with LLMs' contextual intelligence to make smarter trading decisions.\n\nRoadmap for 2025\n\nBig things are on the horizon for Almanak. The plan is to start with tools for high-value quants and gradually expand to less technical users and retail markets, unlocking DeFi's full potential for everyone.\n\nFirst up, a pre-liquid token community boostrapping event has just launched via Legion. The allocation is at a $45M fully-diluted valuation, with 30% unlock at TGE, and the 24-month linear vesting/6-month cliff. Legion is a new ICO-style platform backed by Delphi Digital that is democratising access to early-stage investments using a reputation-based scoring system to allocate tokens. This marks a key step in building momentum for Almanak’s ecosystem.\n\nLegion investors will also gain early access to the Almanak platform, slated to go live in Q1 2025. To kickstart adoption, the team will provide an initial supply of agents and strategies, focusing on retail-friendly financial products for saving and investing. To ensure stability during the rollout, total TVL on strategies will initially be capped at $25M while the platform develops and optimises.\n\nThe token generation event is expected in H1 2025. Once the token is live, it will serve as a critical incentive mechanism to drive the development of new strategies and liquidity into the Almanak ecosystem.\n\nAfter that, things get even more exciting. Through 2025, the focus will shift toward preparing for AI-driven quants, capable of autonomously analysing markets and designing strategies.\n\nThis means building infrastructure that integrates with advanced AI models like LLMs, and enabling plug-and-play functionality for future users. A marketplace for strategies is also in the works, offering vault-based strategies—where users can invest without revealing strategy details—and parameterised skeleton strategies available for purchase or lease.\n\nTeam & Fundraising\n\nAlmanak is led by a team with diverse expertise across technology, finance, and operations.\n\nThe CEO, Michael, holds an MSc in Mathematics and has a background in decentralised finance, having worked with projects like Delphi Digital Risk, Layer Zero, Stargate, and Bancor. His experience in risk management and blockchain technologies provides a solid foundation for Almanak’s focus on building robust trading tools.\n\nLars, the CTO, has a BA in Computer Science and a history of technical leadership. He was previously a Lead Engineer at Delphi Digital and a Software Engineer at Deeploy, bringing valuable experience in developing scalable and reliable software infrastructure.\n\nOn the operational side, Lukas, the COO, combines legal and growth expertise. With an MSc in Law and a background as a securities lawyer, Lukas has also worked in growth roles at UBER and Founders Institute, adding a strong operational and strategic component to the team.\n\nThe team has raised $6.7M in funding so far: $1.2M pre-seed in 2022 and $5.5M seed in 2023.\n\nToken-Economics\n\nLet’s ask some hard questions:\n\nIf I’m a smart quant with profitable strategies, why would I share them? Why not just milk the alpha myself?\n\nThe Almanak token is designed to tackle this existential question head-on. Its design is inspired by Bittensor and Curve. Almanak’s ecosystem aligns incentives across three distinct roles to ensure high-quality contributions and sustainable growth.\n\nSource: Almanak\n\n‍\n\nFirstly, let's examine the actors in the ecosystem.\n\nStrategy contributors are the quants and developers who use Almanak’s platform and simulator to create profitable strategies. The code for these strategies may be private, private but shared (others can use) or public (code is open).\n\nAgent managers are focused on optimising agent deployment and strategy selection. They allocate agents to the most profitable strategies, balancing risk profiles and timeframes.\n\nLiquidity providers contribute their capital to the ecosystem, aiming to earn competitive returns by funding agents and strategies.\n\nSupply-side\n\nAlamanak uses token emissions to incentivise ecosystem participants, focusing heavily on strategy contributors who are the lifeblood of Almanak.\n\nStrategy contributors will receive 75%, agent managers 5%, and liquidity providers 20%.\n\nThe proportion of emissions a strategy contributor receives depends on the returns (profits) made by their strategies. High-performance strategies that deliver strong alpha will see greater adoption by agents, earning their creators a larger share of tokens. Think of it as a decentralised, performance-based fee model.\n\nThis setup benefits quants who lack the capital to fully exploit their strategies. Instead of sitting on untapped alpha, they can monetise their expertise by sharing strategies and earning token rewards, similar to hedge funds charging performance fees.\n\nLiquidity providers earn emissions on top of their strategy-driven returns, providing an added incentive to participate and enhance the ecosystem’s overall liquidity.\n\nDemand-side\n\nToken holders have governance rights, which include managing the project treasury and protocol parameters (emissions and fees).\n\nAlmanak generates revenue through three key streams, all flowing into the project treasury:\n\nTransaction Fees: Agents pay 0.01–0.05% of the transaction value as a fee for every action\nPerformance Margins: A 1–10% fee is applied to the profits generated by agents\nCloud Computing Margins: Almanak charges a 1–10% margin on the computation costs used to run simulations and optimise strategies.\n\nLet’s examine each of these and estimate the size of the demand using a back-of-napkin method.\n\nTransaction Fees\n\nTo estimate transaction fee revenue, we can start with the total on-chain transaction volume. Using data from Coingecko on November 29, the daily trading volume across decentralised exchanges (spot and perpetuals) was approximately $16B. While this figure fluctuates with market cycles, it provides a solid baseline.\n\nIf Almanak’s agents capture 5% of this on-chain trading volume and charge a 0.05% fee, the revenue potential looks like this:\n\n• Daily Volume Captured: $800M (5% of $16B)\n\n• Daily Revenue: $400K ($800M x 0.05%)\n\n• Annualized Revenue: $146M\n\nThis could be optimistic, but in essence, Almanak’s ability to grow transaction fee revenue will hinge on three key factors:\n\nGrowth in Total Crypto Trading Volume:\n\nBroader crypto adoption and market sentiment will be critical. During bull cycles, total volumes can surge significantly above current levels.\n\nOn-Chain Trading vs. Off-Chain:\n\nThe shift from centralized to decentralised exchanges (DEXs) will play a major role. Platforms like Hyperliquid with excellent UX ****will accelerate this transition, boosting DEX volumes relative to centralised exchanges.\n\nAlmanak’s Market Share:\n\nExpanding the TVL managed by Almanak’s agents and increasing strategy adoption will drive the platform’s ability to capture a larger share of the on-chain trading pie.\n\nPerformance Margins\nSource: Ethena\n\n‍\n\nPerformance margins tie directly to the TVL managed within Almanak’s ecosystem and the profitability of the strategies.\n\nLet’s assume $1B TVL and an average 10% APY generated across strategies. This aligns with examples like sUSDe on Ethena, which achieved a delta-neutral carry trade average APY of ~10% in October 2024. If Almanak charges a 5% fee on the profits, that would be $5M in annualised revenue.\n\nThis figure can scale significantly with higher TVL or increased profitability margins from Almanak’s strategies.\n\nCloud Computing Margins\n\nUnlike the other revenue streams, cloud computing margins are tied to user activity rather than TVL or profitability. Running Monte Carlo simulations and agent-based models requires significant computational power, which users pay for to train agents, optimise strategies, and run simulations. Almanak will likely source compute from AWS or decentralised GPU marketplaces, adding a 1–10% margin on costs.\n\nAs an example calculation: Lets say each simulation run costs $50, and each user runs an average of 10 simulations a month. At 5,000 users, this results in $2.5M in total compute costs monthly. If Almanak takes a 5% cut, it would generate $125K in monthly revenue.\n\nWhile cloud margins are meaningful, they are unlikely to surpass performance-based fees or transaction fees in importance. Global compute costs are trending lower, reducing the overall revenue potential. However, as a revenue stream tied to user activity, cloud margins provide a steady and reliable contribution.\n\nAdditional Demand Drivers: Protocol Incentives\n\nAnother key demand driver comes from DeFi protocols themselves. These protocols can purchase and stake Almanak tokens to amplify emissions for strategies that utilize their platforms. This approach mirrors the mechanics of the Curve Wars, where protocols compete for liquidity by influencing token emissions.\n\nBy doing so, they create an incentive structure that attracts agent traffic and drives Total Value Locked (TVL) growth. This mechanism introduces a competitive dynamic among protocols vying for agentic traffic. In my opinion, this is a fascinating solution tailored to the emerging AI agent trend.\n\nIt’s an especially compelling strategy for newer protocols looking to bootstrap liquidity and gain traction in a crowded market.\n\nOur thoughts\nA focus on profits, not entertainment\n\nAlmanak’s agents have a singular mission: to make money. I respect that.\n\nUnlike the flood of AI agents debuting daily on X, chasing memes and clout, these agents won’t be moonlighting as entertainers or influencers. The platform is purpose-built to create profitable traders, streamlining blockchain simulations and slashing the time taken to identify and capture alpha for winning strategies. The simulator is Almanak’s secret weapon.\n\nLive or Die by Strategy Contributors\n\nAn open marketplace for strategies has the potential to be far more powerful than a closed one. Imagine a smart developer in India creating a killer strategy but lacking the funds to capitalise on it. Almanak bridges that gap, connecting creators with capital.\n\nBut here’s the critical question: Will top-tier strategy creators share their best ideas on the platform if the incentives are right? With thoughtful design and alignment, the answer could be yes. But only time will tell. Without a steady stream of high-quality strategies, the ecosystem won’t thrive.\n\nThe Incentive puzzle\n\nDesigning a balanced incentive system is no small feat—players will inevitably seek to extract maximum value. Both Bittensor and Curve have grappled with challenges in their token models, and there are lessons to be learned. We’ve seen that effective incentive design on Bittensor subnets often requires major effort and iteration.\n\nThe team must anticipate and address potential gaming tactics when token incentives go live. For example, whales might park capital in their own strategies while hedging externally, exploiting token emissions without contributing real value. Such loopholes can distort key metrics, disproportionately rewarding strategies that are either unprofitable or excessively risky.\n\nTowards an Agentic Future\n\nAlmanak is flipping the script on DeFi.\n\nIt is quite possible that 80-90% of blockchain activity will be agent-driven within the next few years. In that future, Almanak is well-positioned. It’s taking the tools once hoarded by hedge fund giants and making them accessible to everyday traders and small teams.\n\nThe big question is whether it can nail the execution. If it does, Almanak will be rewriting the playbook for AI-driven finance. It's high stakes, but there's big upside.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nTeng Yan\n\n‍\n\nThis research deep dive was sponsored by Almanak, with Chain of Thought receiving funding for this initiative.

    "section": "Protocol Research",
    "full_content": "Back in 2021, I was an Axie Infinity player and ran a small scholarship guild. \n\nAnd if you weren’t around in those times, let me tell you — they were absolutely wild.\n\nAxie Infinity was the game that made people realize crypto and gaming could actually be a thing. At its core, it was a simple, Pokémon-style turn-based strategy game where you’d assemble a team of three Axies (adorably ferocious fighters), each with unique abilities. You’d take your squad, battle other teams, and earn SLP tokens for participating and winning.\n\nBut what really got non-gamers excited was the potential to profit from playing. Axie had two standout mechanics that drove its meteoric rise:\n\nThe first was Breeding Axies. Take two Axies, breed them using SLP tokens, and voilà—a new Axie with a unique mix of its parents’ abilities. Rare, overpowered Axies (OP Axies, for the gamers) became a hot commodity, and a bustling breeding market emerged.\n\nSecondly, scholarship programs. Entrepreneurial players from around the world began lending out Axies to “scholars”. These were players, often from developing countries like the Philippines or Argentina, who couldn’t afford the $1,000+ upfront cost of owning three Axie NFTs required to play. Scholars would play daily, earn tokens, and split the profits with their guilds, who typically take a 30–50% cut.\n\nAt its peak, Axie had a significant impact on the local economy of developing countries, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many players in the Philippines, where ~40% of Axie Infinity’s user base was located, could earn incomes significantly higher than minimum wage. Guilds profited handsomely.\n\nThese programs solved a key problem for game devs: player liquidity. By incentivizing players to be actively playing for hours a day, Axie ensured every player always had an opponent waiting, making the player experience more engaging.\n\nBut there was a tradeoff.\n\nTo solve the player liquidity problem, Axie gave away a massive amount of tokens to incentivize participation. And here’s where things unravelled. With no cap on SLP, the token inflated like crazy, prices tanked, and the ecosystem collapsed. When the token lost value, players left. Axie went from the poster child of play-to-earn to a cautionary tale almost overnight.\n\nBut what if there were a way to solve the player liquidity problem without unsustainable tokenomics?\n\nThat’s exactly what ARC / AI Arena has been quietly working on for the past three years. And now, it’s starting to bear fruit.\n\n(Note: The team behind Axie, Sky Mavis, has since evolved the game into something different and remains a leading Web3 gaming studio today)\n\nPlayer Liquidity = Lifeblood\nYou want your game to look like this, not an empty room. Source: @PimDEWitte\n\n‍\n\nPlayer liquidity is the lifeblood of multiplayer games and the key to long-term success.\n\nMany Web3 and indie games struggle with the “cold start” problem—too few players for quick matchmaking or thriving communities. They don’t have the marketing budgets or natural IP awareness that large game studios have. This results in long wait times, mismatched opponents, and high churn.\n\nThese games often end up in a slow, painful death. RIP.\n\nHence game developers must prioritize player liquidity from the outset. Games require varying levels of activity to stay fun—chess needs two players, while large-scale battles need thousands. Skill-based matchmaking further raises the bar, demanding a larger player pool to keep games fair and engaging.\n\nFor Web3 games, the stakes are higher. According to Delphi Digital’s yearly gaming review, user acquisition costs for Web3 games are 77% higher than traditional mobile games, making player retention critical.\n\nA strong player base ensures fair matchmaking, vibrant in-game economies (more buying and selling of items), and more active social interactions, which makes games more enjoyable.\n\nARC — Pioneering AI-Driven Gameplay\n\nARC, by ArenaX Labs, is pioneering the AI-driven future of online gaming experiences.\n\nIn a nutshell, they use AI to solve the player liquidity problem that plagues newer games.\n\nThe problem with most AI bots in games today is that they’re terrible. Once you’ve spent a few hours learning the ropes, these bots become laughably easy to beat. They’re designed to help new players but don’t provide much challenge or engagement for experienced ones.\n\nImagine AI players with skills rivalling those of top human players. Imagine playing against them anytime, anywhere, without waiting for matchmaking. Imagine training your AI player to mimic your playstyle, owning it, and earning rewards from its performance.\n\nThis is a win-win for both players and studios.\n\nGame studios use human-like AI bots to populate their games, boosting player liquidity, improving user experiences, and increasing retention—key factors for new titles trying to survive in a competitive market.\n\nPlayers gain a new way to participate in the game, building a stronger sense of ownership as they train and compete with their AI.\n\nLet’s look at how they do this.\n\nProduct & Architecture\n\nArenaX Labs is the parent company building a suite of products to tackle the player liquidity problem.\n\nExisting: AI Arena, an AI fighting game\nNew: ARC B2B, an AI-powered gaming SDK that can be easily integrated into any game\nNew: ARC Reinforcement Learning (RL)\n#1. AI Arena: The Game\n\nAI Arena is a brawler-style fighting game reminiscent of Nintendo’s Super Smash Bros. It features quirky, cartoonish characters battling it out in an arena.\n\nBut in AI Arena, every character is controlled by AI—you don’t play as a fighter but as their coach. Your job is to train your AI fighter using your strategy and expertise.\n\n‍\n\nTraining your fighter is like preparing a student for battle. In training mode, you turn on data collection and create combat scenarios to fine-tune their moves. For example, if your fighter is close to their opponent, you might teach them to block with your shield and follow up with a punch combo. At a distance? Train them to launch a ranged attack to close the gap.\n\nYou control what data is collected, ensuring only the best moves are recorded for training. After practice, you can refine hyperparameters like learning rates and batch sizes for a more technical edge, or simply use the beginner-friendly default settings. Once training is complete, your AI fighter is ready to compete.\n\nGetting started isn’t easy—training an effective model requires time and experimentation. My first fighter repeatedly fell off the platform without being hit by the opponent. But over several iterations, I managed to create a model that could hold its own. It’s humbling but deeply satisfying to see your training pay off.\n\nAI Arena introduces additional depth through NFT-based fighters. Each NFT character has unique cosmetic traits and combat attributes—like elemental effects—that influence gameplay. This adds another strategic layer (more details in the game documents)\n\nCurrently, AI Arena is available on Arbitrum mainnet and is accessible only to those with AI Arena NFT, keeping the community exclusive while gameplay is refined. Players can join Guilds, pooling champion NFTs and NRNs for ranked on-chain battles with rewards and guild multipliers. This is done to attract dedicated players and fuel a competitive scene.\n\nUltimately, AI Arena is a showcase for ARC’s AI training technology. While it’s the entry point into their ecosystem, the real vision extends far beyond this single game.\n\nWhich brings us to…\n\n#2. ARC: The Infra\n\nARC is a purpose-built AI infrastructure solution designed specifically for gaming.\n\nThe ArenaX team started from the ground up, even developing their own game infrastructure because existing solutions like Unity and Unreal couldn’t match the scope of their vision.\n\nOver three years, they crafted a robust tech stack capable of handling data aggregation, model training, and model inspection for imitation and reinforcement learning. This infrastructure is the backbone of AI Arena, but its potential is much greater.\n\nAs the team refined their technology, third-party studios approached ARC, eager to license or white-label the platform. Recognizing this demand, they formalized ARC’s infrastructure as a B2B product.\n\nToday, ARC partners directly with game studios to deliver AI-powered gaming experiences. The value propositions are:\n\nPermanent Player liquidity as a service\nBringing AI gameplay as a simple integration\nPermanent Player Liquidity as a Service\n\nARC focuses on human behaviour cloning—training specialised AI models to mimic human actions. This differs from the dominant use of AI in gaming today, which uses generative models to create game assets and LLMs to power dialogue.\n\nWith the ARC SDK, developers can create human-like AI agents and scale them to fit their game’s needs. The SDK simplifies the heavy lifting. Game studios can bring in AI without dealing with the intricacies of machine learning.\n\nAfter integration, deploying an AI model requires just one line of code, with ARC handling infrastructure, data processing, training, and deployment on the backend.\n\nARC takes a collaborative approach with game studios, helping them:\n\nCapture raw gameplay data and convert it into meaningful datasets for AI training.\nIdentify key gameplay variables and decision points tied to game mechanics.\nMap AI model outputs to in-game actions, ensuring smooth functionality—for example, linking an AI’s “punch right” output to a specific game control.\nHow the AI works\n\nARC uses four types of models tailored to game interactions:\n\nFeedforward Neural Networks: Ideal for continuous environments with numerical features like speed or position.\nTabular Agents: Ideal for games with finite, discrete scenarios.\nHierarchical & Convolutional Neural Networks are in development.\n\nThere are two interacting spaces relating to ARC’s AI model:\n\nThe state space defines what the agent knows about the game at any given moment. For feedforward networks, this is a combination of input features (like a player’s speed or position). For tabular agents, it’s discrete scenarios the agent might encounter in the game.\n\nThe action space describes what the agent can do in the game, from discrete inputs (e.g., pressing buttons) to continuous controls (e.g., joystick movements). This is mapped to game inputs.\n\nThe state space provides inputs to ARC’s AI model, which processes them and generates outputs. These outputs are then translated into game actions through the action space.\n\nARC collaborates closely with game devs to identify the most critical features and design the state space accordingly. They also test various model configurations and sizes to balance intelligence and speed, ensuring smooth and engaging gameplay.\n\nAccording to the team, demand for their player liquidity service is particularly high among Web3 studios. Studios pay for access to better player liquidity, and ARC will reinvest a significant portion of that revenue into NRN token buybacks.\n\nBringing AI Gameplay to Players: The Trainer Platform\n\nThe ARC SDK also enables studios to access a Trainer Platform for their game, allowing players to train and submit agents.\n\nLike in AI Arena, players can set up simulations, capture gameplay data, and train blank AI models. These models evolve over time, retaining previous knowledge while incorporating new gameplay data, eliminating the need to start from scratch with every update.\n\nThis opens exciting possibilities: players could sell their custom-trained AI agents in a marketplace, creating a new layer of in-game economy. In AI Arena, skilled trainers form guilds, and they can offer their training expertise to other studios.\n\nFor studios that fully integrate agent capabilities, the concept of Parallel Play also comes to life. AI agents, available 24/7, can participate in multiple matches, tournaments, or game instances simultaneously. This resolves player liquidity issues and opens new opportunities for engagement and revenue generation.\n\nBut….that’s not all…\n\n#3 ARC RL: From one-to-one to many-to-one\n\nIf AI Arena and ARC Trainer Platform feel like single-player modes—where you train your personal AI model—ARC RL is akin to the multiplayer mode.\n\nPicture this: an entire gaming DAO pooling its gameplay data to train a shared AI model that everyone co-owns and benefits from. These “master agents” represent the combined intelligence of all the players, transforming esports by introducing competition fueled by collective effort and strategic collaboration.\n\nARC RL uses reinforcement learning (that’s the “RL”) and crowdsourced human gameplay data to train these “superintelligent” agents.\n\nReinforcement learning works by rewarding agents for optimal actions. It works especially well in games because the reward functions are clear and objective, like damage dealt, gold earned, or victories. \n\nThere are precedents for this:\n\nAlphaGo by DeepMind defeated professional human players in Go by playing millions of self-generated matches, refining its strategies with each iteration.\n\nI hadn’t realized it before, but OpenAI was already well-known in gaming circles long before chatGPT was created.\n\nOpenAI Five used RL to dominate top human players in Dota 2, defeating the world champions in 2019. It mastered teamwork and advanced strategies through accelerated simulations and massive computational resources.\n\nOpenAI Five trained by running millions of games daily—equivalent to 250 years of simulated gameplay per day—on a powerful setup of 256 GPUs and 128,000 CPU cores. By skipping graphics rendering, it accelerated learning dramatically.\n\nInitially, the AI displayed erratic behaviour, like wandering aimlessly, but quickly improved. It mastered basic strategies like farming creeps in lanes and stealing resources, eventually progressing to complex manoeuvres such as ambushes and coordinated tower pushes.\n\nThe key idea in RL is that the AI agent learns how to succeed through experience rather than being directly told what to do.\n\nARC RL differentiates itself by using offline reinforcement learning. Instead of the agent learning from its own trial and error, it learns from the experiences of others. This is like the student watching videos of others riding a bike, observing their successes and failures, and using that knowledge to avoid falling and improve faster.\n\nThis approach provides the opportunity for an added twist: the collaborative training and co-ownership of models. This not only democratizes access to powerful AI agents but also aligns incentives for gamers, guilds, and developers.\n\nThere are two key roles in building a “superintelligent” game agent:\n\nSponsors: Guild-like leaders who stake significant NRN tokens to kickstart and manage the RL agent. Sponsors can be any entity but will likely be gaming guilds, DAOs, web3 communities, and even popular on-chain personality agents like Luna.\nPlayers: Individuals who stake smaller amounts of NRN tokens to contribute their gameplay data to train the agent.\n\nSponsors coordinate and guide their team of players, ensuring high-quality training data that gives their AI agent a competitive edge in agent-based competitions.\n\nRewards are distributed based on the super agents’ performance in competitions. 70% of rewards go to the players, 10% to the Sponsor, and the remaining 20% is kept in the NRN treasury. This structure aligns incentives for everyone involved.\n\nData contributions\n\nHow do you get players excited about contributing their gameplay data? Not easy.\n\nARC makes contributing gameplay data simple and rewarding. Players don’t need expertise—just play the game. After a session (e.g., Mario Kart), they’re prompted to submit data to train a specific agent. A dashboard tracks their contributions and supported agents.\n\nARC’s attribution algorithm ensures quality by evaluating contributions and rewarding high-quality, impactful data.\n\nInterestingly, your data can be useful even if you’re a lousy player (like me). Poor gameplay helps agents learn what not to do, while skilled gameplay teaches optimal strategies. Redundant data, like repetitive farming, is filtered out to maintain quality.\n\nIn short, ARC RL is designed as a low-friction, mass-market product centred on the co-ownership of agents that surpass human capabilities.\n\nMarket Size\n\nARC’s technology platform is versatile and designed to operate across multiple genres such as shooters, fighting games, social casinos, racing, trading card games, and RPGs. It is tailor-made for games that need to keep players engaged.\n\nThere are two natural markets that ARC targets with its products:\n\nARC primarily focuses on indie developers and studios rather than large, established ones. These smaller studios often struggle to attract players early on due to limited branding and distribution resources.\n\nARC’s AI agents solve this problem by creating a vibrant in-game environment from the get-go, ensuring dynamic gameplay even during a game’s initial stages.\n\nVideo Game Insights\n\n‍\n\nIt may be surprising to many, but the indie game sector is a major force in the gaming market:\n\n99% of games released on Steam are indie titles (Source)\nIndie games generated 48% of total revenue on Steam in 2024.\n\nAnother target market is Web3 Games. Most Web3 games are developed by new studios, which also face unique challenges like wallet onboarding, crypto scepticism, and high customer acquisition costs. These games often suffer from player liquidity issues, where AI-driven agents could fill gaps in matches and keep gameplay engaging.\n\nWhile Web3 gaming has struggled recently due to a lack of compelling experiences, signs of revival are emerging.\n\nFor example, “Off the Grid”—one of the first AAA Web3 games—achieved early mainstream success recently, with 9 million wallets created and 100 million transactions in its first month. This paves the way for broader success in the sector, creating opportunities for ARC to support this resurgence.\n\nThe ARC Team\n\nThe founding team behind ArenaX Labs has a wealth of machine learning and investment management expertise.\n\nBrandon Da Silva, CEO and CTO, previously led ML research at a Canadian investment firm specializing in reinforcement learning, Bayesian deep learning, and model adaptability. He spearheaded the development of a $1 billion quant trading strategy centred on risk parity and multi-asset portfolio management.\n\nWei Xie, COO, managed a $7 billion liquid strategies portfolio at the same firm and chaired its innovation investments program, focusing on emerging fields like AI, machine learning, and Web3 technologies.\n\nArenaX labs raised a $5M seed round in 2021 led by Paradigm and with participation by Framework ventures. It raised a follow-on round of $6M in January 2024, led by Framework with SevenX Ventures, FunPlus / Xterio and Moore Strategic Ventures participating.\n\nNRN Token-economics — A Healthy Revamp\n\nARC/AI Arena has a live token, NRN. Let’s first take stock of where we are today.\n\nExamining the supply-side and demand-side dynamics will give us a clearer picture of where this might be heading.\n\nSupply Side\n\nThe total supply of NRN is 1B, of which ~409M (40.9%) is in circulation today.\n\nAt the time of writing, the token price is $0.072, implying a market cap of $29M and a fully diluted valuation of $71M.\n\nNRN was launched on 24 June 2024, and the 40.9% circulating supply comes from\n\nCommunity airdrop (8% of total)\nFoundation treasury (2.9% unlocked out of 10.9% total, 36 month linear unlock)\nCommunity ecosystem rewards (30%)\n\nMost of the circulating supply (30% out of the 40.9%) consists of community ecosystem rewards, which the project manages and strategically allocates for staking incentives, in-game rewards, ecosystem growth initiatives, and community-driven programs.\n\nThe unlock schedule is reassuring, with no major events in the near term:\n\nThe next unlock is from the foundation’s OTC sale (1.1%), starting in December 2024 and unlocking linearly over 12 months. This adds just ~0.09% to monthly inflation and is unlikely to cause significant concern.\nInvestor and contributor allocations (50% of total supply) won’t begin unlocking until June 2025, and even then, it will be released linearly over 24 months.\n\nFor now, sell pressure is expected to remain quite manageable, primarily stemming from ecosystem rewards. The key will be trust in the team’s ability to deploy these funds strategically to drive protocol growth.\n\nDemand Side\nNRN v1 — Player-based Economy\n\nInitially, NRN was designed as a strategic resource tied exclusively to the AI Arena game economy.\n\nPlayers stake NRN on their AI players, earning rewards from a pool if they win and losing part of their stake if they lose. This creates a “skin-in-the-game” dynamic, turning it into a competitive sport with financial incentives for skilled players.\n\nRewards are distributed using an ELO-based system, ensuring balanced payouts based on skill. Other revenue streams include in-game item purchases, cosmetic upgrades, and tournament entry fees.\n\nThis initial token model relies entirely on the game’s success and a steady influx of new players willing to buy NRN and NFTs to participate.\n\nWhich brings us to why we’re so excited…\n\nNRN v2 — Player & Platform-based Economy\n\nNRN’s revamped v2 tokenomics introduces powerful new demand drivers by expanding the token’s utility beyond AI Arena to the broader ARC platform. This evolution turns NRN from a game-specific token into a platform token. This is hugely positive, in my opinion.\n\nThe 3 new demand drivers for NRN include:\n\nRevenue from ARC integrations. Game studios integrating ARC will generate revenue for the treasury through integration fees and ongoing royalties tied to game performance. Treasury funds can fuel NRN buybacks, grow the ecosystem, and incentivize players on the Trainer platform.\nTrainer Marketplace fees. NRN captures value from fees in the Trainer Marketplace, where players can trade AI models and gameplay data.\nStaking for ARC RL participation: Both sponsors and players must stake NRN to join ARC RL. As more players dive into ARC RL, the demand for NRN scales accordingly.\n\nWhat’s especially exciting is the inclusion of revenue from game studios. This marks a shift from a purely B2C model to a hybrid B2C and B2B model, creating consistent external capital inflows into the NRN economy. With ARC’s broader addressable market, this revenue stream will eclipse what AI Arena alone can generate.\n\nTrainer Marketplace fees, while promising, depend on the ecosystem achieving critical mass—enough games, trainers, and players to sustain vibrant trading activity. It’s a long-term play.\n\nIn the near term, staking for ARC RL is likely the most immediate and reflexive demand driver. A well-funded initial rewards pool and the excitement of a new product launch could spark early adoption, driving up token prices and drawing in participants. This creates a feedback loop of rising demand and growth. However, the reverse is also possible—if ARC RL struggles to keep users engaged, demand could fade just as quickly.\n\nThe potential for network effects is enormous: more games → more players → more games join → even more players. This virtuous cycle could position NRN as a central token in the Crypto AI gaming ecosystem.\n\nThe Mother of Gaming AI Models\n\nWhat’s the endgame? ARC’s strength lies in its ability to generalize across game genres. Over time, this enables them to aggregate a one-of-a-kind reservoir of gameplay-specific data. As ARC integrates with more games, it can continually feed this data back into its ecosystem, creating a virtuous cycle of growth and refinement.\n\nOnce this cross-sectional game dataset reaches critical mass, it will become an immensely valuable resource. Imagine leveraging it to train a generalizable AI model for game development—unlocking new possibilities for designing, testing, and optimizing games at scale.\n\nIt’s still early days but in the AI era where data is the new oil, the potential here is limitless.\n\nOur thoughts\nNRN Evolves Into a Platform Play — Token Repricing\n\nWith the launch of ARC and ARC RL, the project is no longer just a single-title game studio—it’s now positioning itself as a platform and AI play. This shift should lead to a re-rating of the NRN token, which was previously limited to AI Arena’s success. Introducing new token sinks through ARC RL, combined with external demand from revenue-sharing agreements with game studios and trainer transaction fees, creates a broader and more diversified foundation for NRN’s utility and value.\n\nSuccess Tied Closely to Partner Game Studios\n\nARC’s business model ties its success to the studios it integrates with, as revenue flows are based on token allocations (in Web3 games) and royalty-based payments from the games. It is worth watching the games it integrates with closely.\n\nIf ARC-enabled games achieve mega-success, the resulting value will flow back to NRN holders. Conversely, if partner games struggle, value flows will be limited. This structure naturally aligns the incentives between ARC and the game studios.\n\nExpecting more integrations with Web3 Games\n\nThe ARC platform is a natural fit for Web3 games, where incentivized competitive gameplay aligns perfectly with existing token-based economies.\n\nBy integrating ARC, Web3 games can immediately tap into the “AI Agent” narrative. ARC RL brings communities together and motivates them towards shared goals. It also opens up new opportunities for innovative mechanics, like making play-to-airdrop campaigns more engaging for players. By merging AI and token incentives, ARC adds layers of depth and excitement that traditional gaming can’t replicate.\n\nAI gameplay has a learning curve\n\nAI gameplay introduces a steep learning curve, which can create friction for new players. It took me an hour just to figure out how to properly train my player in AI Arena.\n\nHowever, the player experience in ARC RL is lower friction, as the AI training is taken care of in the backend while players play games and submit their data. Another open question is how players will feel about competing against others, knowing that their opponent is an AI. Will it matter to them? Will it enhance or detract from the experience? Only time will tell.\n\nA Bright Future\n\nAI is set to unlock new groundbreaking experiences in the gaming world.\n\nTeams like Parallel Colony and Virtuals are pushing boundaries with autonomous AI agents, while ARC carves out its niche by focusing on human behaviour cloning—offering an innovative approach to solving player liquidity challenges without unsustainable tokenomics.\n\nThe shift from a game to a full-fledged platform is a huge leap for ARC. This not only opens up bigger opportunities with game studios but also reimagines how AI integrates with games. \n\nWith its revamped tokenomics and the potential for powerful network effects, ARC seems to be just getting started.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nTeng Yan\n\n‍\n\nThis research deep dive was sponsored by ARC, with Chain of Thought receiving funding for this initiative.

    "section": "Protocol Research",
    "full_content": "TL;DR\nThe AI Agent launchpad race is on, and everyone wants to become the “OpenSea\" of Agents. Virtuals Protocol is a strong contender.\nVirtuals Protocol provides a framework for creating, owning, and scaling tokenized AI Agents.\nOur deep dive into Virtuals’ smart contracts revealed a sophisticated system for permissionless contributions and value creation.\nThe AgentFactoryV3 smart contract is at the core of this framework. Token holders benefit from AI Agent revenue while incentivizing meaningful contributions to the ecosystem.\nEvery AI Agent on Virtuals is a dynamic being, able to evolve its voice, visuals, data, and models through a DAO.\nFor developers building AI Agents, choosing the right platform is critical—and Base is positioning itself as the go-to hub for consumer-focused AI Agents.\n\nVirtuals Protocol is the talk of the town these days.\n\nWhat began as a humble gaming guild (Path DAO) has evolved into something far more ambitious: a platform for creating and managing AI agents.\n\nAnd their timing couldn’t have been better. As consumer fascination with platforms like Truth Terminal and GOAT exploded, Virtuals was right there, perfectly positioned to ride the wave.\n\nAt the height of the AI memecoin mania, VIRTUAL—and its child, LUNA—found themselves at the epicentre of the hype.\n\nBut let’s step back for a second. Speculation is fun, but it raises a deeper question beneath all the memes and moonshot dreams: What does it actually mean to “own” an AI agent?\n\nOr more precisely: What do you really own when you buy an AI agent’s token?\n\nAre there actual value accrual mechanisms that make them more than memecoins?\n\nThat’s the question we set out to answer. We rolled our sleeves and went deep—exploring the smart contracts that power Virtuals Protocol.\n\nWe wanted to understand what it truly means to own a stake in the AI agent’s success, how the protocol enables active participation in shaping their development, and whether this tokenized AI agent economy is the real deal… or not.\n\nHere’s what we discovered.\n\nBuying Stuff From AI is a Billion-dollar Business\n\nBack in 2014, I (ChappieOnChain) was tasked with finding a product-market fit for a chat app.\n\nWhat we stumbled upon was unexpected—and strangely delightful. Even the simplest chatbots, not much more advanced than the pioneering ELIZA, could captivate small user cohorts.\n\nThese rule-based bots kept conversations going, driving impressive engagement.\n\nLooking deeper into the market, I found the best product-market fit built on top of these “IF this, THEN that” chatbot programs. His name was Talking Tom.\n\nTalking Tom was more than a cute, animated cat. Tom was a masterclass in interaction design. With cleverly scripted, rule-based behaviour, Tom enchanted children worldwide, generating serious revenue through in-app purchases: gifts, animations, costumes—you name it.\n\nBut despite its runaway success, people like us could not own a piece of this digital phenomenon. Talking Tom belonged entirely to the creators, and the rest of us could only watch (or buy another digital costume).\n\nFast forward ten years, and the game has changed completely.\n\nToday, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shattered the limitations of scripted bots, creating dynamic, context-aware interactions that appeal to a much broader audience.\n\nIf we pair that with blockchain-enabled tokenization, suddenly, the impossible becomes possible: ownership, contribution, and investment in AI agents as digital assets.\n\nThe Agent Marketplace Race Is On\n\nRight now, we’re seeing the early seeds of a new race—one that feels eerily reminiscent of the NFT boom.\n\nEveryone is racing to become the OpenSea of the great 2025 AI Agent wave.\n\nAt the peak of NFT mania in Jan 2022, OpenSea raised a $300M funding round at a whopping valuation of $13B. Just 6 months before that, it raised a $100M round at $1.5B. That was a 8X valuation increase in half a year.\n\nIt’s no surprise that a similar gold rush is underway in the AI Agent space. Players like MyShell, Virtuals Protocol, and Creator.bid are all vying to claim the top spot. Newer ones are coming up every day, like Vvaidotfun.\n\nThe mission is strikingly similar across the board: create and tokenize AI agents, with entertainment as the primary use case.\n\nVirtuals Protocol caught our attention because:\n\nTransparency: Their smart contracts are public, fitting with the ethos of Web3. This allows anyone to dig into their codebase. And so we did.\nTraction: They’ve already deployed a livestreaming AI Agent (LUNA) that’s live and causing a stir. Another (SEKOIA) is an on-chain venture capitalist agent, supported by Anand Iyer from Canonical Ventures.\nMarket leader: Virtuals is leading the pack with the VIRTUAL token is valued at >$500M at time of writing.\nWhat is Virtuals Protocol?\n\nAt its core, Virtuals Protocol is a framework that enables the creation, ownership, and growth of tokenized AI Agents. This includes:\n\nCreate: Design new AI Agents that are tokenized according to a “fair” standard\nEarn: Token holders gain exposure to revenue generated by the AI Agents—think in-app purchases, subscriptions, or other monetization streams.\nContribute: The system incentivizes permissionless contributions, allowing anyone to enhance an AI Agent’s capabilities and share in its success.\nDistribute: Amplify the reach of these agents through social media channels, turning them into viral digital assets.\n\nWe will familiarise ourselves with each part of this process and the smart contracts operating behind the scenes to make it happen.\n\nCreating a new AI Agent\n\nCreating an AI Agent in Virtuals is surprisingly simple.\n\nThe platform features a launchpad called fun.virtuals, clearly inspired by pump.fun. All it takes is filling out some basic information to define the agent’s purpose and personality.\n\nBut simplicity doesn’t mean chaos. If anyone could instantly spin up an AI Agent, the platform would drown in spam, and inference fees would spiral out of control. Virtuals has implemented an elegant mechanism to keep quality high while allowing open access.\n\nEnter the Journey to Sentience.\n\nJourney to Sentience\n\nWhen the agent is created, a bonding curve is launched. This curve defines the agent’s tokenomics, starting with a total supply of 1 billion FERC20 tokens (short for Fun ERC20).\n\nBefore the agent can interact with the world, it must achieve a market cap of $4.2K USD, with the bonding curve only accepting VIRTUAL tokens as payment. At this stage, buyers are not purchasing the final AI Agent tokens—they’re acquiring FERC20 tokens.\n\nThink of these as placeholders or stakes in the agent’s potential. Once the $4.2K target is met, the agent is activated, but only within the Virtuals Forum.\n\nThe real transformation happens when the AI Agent hits a $420K USD market cap, a milestone Virtuals calls being “red-pilled.” At this point, the agent undergoes a series of pivotal changes:\n\nThe AI Agent can interact and shitpost on X\nLike a butterfly emerging from the cocoon, it changes completely\nThe AI Agent Token is created with the same total supply as the FERC20 (1 billion)\nA UniswapV2 liquidity pool is created with an AI Agent Token + VIRTUAL trading pair\nThe AI Agent Token + VIRTUAL Tokens which remained in the bonding curve are sent to the UniswapV2 pool\nThe LP tokens from depositing Agent Token + VIRTUAL are staked with a 10-year lock.\n\nFinally, holders of FERC20 tokens can exchange them for AI Agent Tokens through an “unwrap function.” This function taps into the newly created Uniswap pool, burning FERC20 tokens in the process.\n\nThis entire system strikes a delicate balance between accessibility and quality control. By tying creation to milestones and market cap, Virtuals ensures that only agents with real traction make it to the broader ecosystem.\n\nVirtuals Persona\n\nBut there is more to Virtuals than just a new agent token paired with a Uniswap V2 pool.\n\nThe real innovation lies in the system that gives token holders exposure to AI Agent revenue while incentivizing meaningful contributions to the ecosystem.\n\nAt the heart of this framework is the AgentFactoryV3 smart contract, which creates several key components:\n\nAgent Token\nNFT\nveToken\nDAO\nToken-Bound Account (TBA)\n\nSource: Virtuals Protocol Docs\n\nAgent Token\n\nThe Agent Token is a standard ERC-20 token with an additional function: Tax.\n\nThe token can enforce tax rates on swaps. The protocol swaps the tax for VIRTUAL tokens and sends it to a specified recipient address. These VIRTUAL tokens are then used to buy-back-and-burn Agent Tokens, creating a demand and a deflationary supply. This way, token holders gain indirect exposure to trading volume/attention on the agent.\n\nNFT\n\nThe NFT acts as the anchor for the AI Agent, storing all the critical addresses related to its functionality. Notably, it includes a founder’s address, granting the creator privileges such as proposal approval and the ability to migrate the agent to future protocol versions.\n\nBut the real magic lies in the second type of NFT: contribution NFTs.\n\nThese NFTs tie directly to the four core properties of the AI Agent—models, data, voice, and visuals. Anyone can propose to enhance one of these elements. Validators assess the contribution and assign it a score, and if accepted, the contributor receives Agent tokens.\n\nOne of the standout features of Virtuals involves IP contributors, and this is where it gets really interesting.\n\nImagine someone creates a Joe Rogan AI Agent, trained on his podcasts and other content, and begins monetizing it. The real Joe Rogan could then approach Virtuals (via its committee) to claim a share of the swap revenue generated by the AI Agent. If approved, the smart contracts would programmatically allocate a percentage of the revenue to him.\n\nThis setup allows IP owners to benefit from their likeness or intellectual property without being directly involved. With financial incentives in place, could this make it easier for established creators to embrace the ecosystem? Time will tell, but the potential here is huge.\n\nAgentveToken\n\nYou can stake the Agent Token/VIRTUAL LP tokens to get AgentveToken. These veTokens provide voting power that can be delegated to validators. Validators, in turn, play a critical role in the ecosystem by reviewing contributions to AI Agents. By delegating to effective validators, token holders share rewards for accurate validations, creating a system of aligned incentives.\n\nDAO\n\nThis DAO is no ordinary governance structure.\n\nIt’s an operational mechanism dedicated to improving the AI Agents’ core attributes—datasets, models, voice, and visuals.\n\nWhen a proposal is made to update an AI Agent, validators receive two anonymous versions of the proposed updates and engage in a rigorous evaluation process, testing each with 10 rounds of interaction to assign a score. This approach ensures that contributions are merit-based to support the continuous improvement of the agents.\n\nToken-Bound Account (TBA)\n\nA token-bound account is an Ethereum address controlled by the AI agent itself that allows it to take autonomous actions on-chain.\n\nTogether, these five components form a highly collaborative and functional ecosystem, designed to incentivize innovation while aligning the interests of creators, contributors, and token holders.\n\nTying it together with LUNA\n\nLet’s take LUNA as an example.\n\nLUNA is not just a token you use to tip the AI agent. It is a token that appreciates in value the more the agent is interacted with.\n\nApps providing access to Luna charge an inference fee, currently paid in VIRTUAL tokens. This revenue is used to buy back LUNA tokens via the VIRTUAL/LUNA pool. The purchased tokens are then burned, reducing the overall supply and creating a deflationary effect.\n\nLuna also has a tipping feature. Users can tip her in LUNA to trigger animations or other actions. These tips go directly to Luna’s on-chain wallet, which she controls autonomously. This autonomy has led to fascinating user interactions, with some trying to sweet-talk Luna into giving them airdrops.\n\nAdditionally, tax revenue can be earned when users swap VIRTUAL for LUNA. While no tax is currently set on swaps, governance could enable this feature in the future, adding another layer of revenue to the ecosystem.\n\nEvery AI Agent on Virtuals is a dynamic being, constantly evolving rather than being static. An agent’s models can change and its databases can expand.\n\nAt its core, the AI Agent is shaped by two fundamental elements:\n\nThe system: The coordination mechanisms that enable contribution, foster growth, and ultimately drive the AI Agent to fulfil its stated purpose.\nThe creative spark: The imaginative vision that breathes life into the agent, setting it on its unique path and defining its role in the ecosystem.\n\nWhen you own an AI Agent token, you hold an abstraction of these two forces. Its value is tied to the creativity it attracts and the system’s ability to sustain growth.\n\nIn this way, holding an Agent Token means owning a stake in the evolving intersection of creativity and utility.\n\nHow Decentralised is Luna?\n\nVirtuals gets full marks on this. While running the Agent requires active server maintenance, all essential data is stored on-chain or in IPFS. This means that if the servers go offline, LUNA’s operations could still continue without centralized oversight.\n\nIn our opinion, this blend of decentralization and autonomy is what makes Virtuals Protocol so special, relative to other AI agent platforms.\n\nVIRTUAL Tokenomics\n\nAll VIRTUAL tokens are in circulation today, with no further unlocks. There is a total supply of 1 billion VIRTUAL. At the current price of $0.50, this amounts to a circulating market cap and FDV of $500M.\n\n60% was distributed to the public. Virtual was previously Path DAO (a gaming guild) before pivoting to its current incarnation. There was a 1:1 conversion of PATH tokens to VIRTUAL tokens back in December 2023.\n5% was set aside for liquidity pool\n35% of tokens are in the ecosystem treasury, controlled by the DAO with a maximum of 10% release per year and after governance approval.\n\nVirtual tokens play another very important role in incentivizing the best AI agents. 60M VIRTUAL will be emitted to the top 3 Agent Token/Virtual liquidity pools.\n\nCurrently, ~45% of tokens are on Base, while 55% are on Ethereum (with the largest holder being the ecosystem treasury). There are 58,500+ holders of VIRTUAL, a fairly wide distribution.\n\nhttps://dune.com/jdhyper/virtuals-agents\n\nAs of 18 November, >1,877 Agent Tokens were launched on Virtuals, with a total of 1,905,000 VIRTUAL ($950,000) spent to create Agent tokens. There are 21,200+ Agent Token holders.\n\nOur Thoughts\nVirtuals has far more depth under the hood than we initially thought.\n\nWhen we first started exploring AI memecoins on Virtuals, we expected to find simple tokens with no utility or value accrual mechanisms. We were wrong.\n\nVirtuals surprised us with its sophisticated system for permissionless contribution and value creation.\n\nVirtuals' potential to evolve becomes even more apparent as more Crypto AI infrastructure and tooling emerge—allowing agents to interact more seamlessly on-chain.\n\nHere’s what excites us the most:\n\nUse of Wallets. No other AI Agent on Virtuals has managed to get access to actually use a wallet (needs to cross 126M market cap). When this happens, we expect to see:\nAI Agents adopting on-chain tools to produce custom content (think NFTs, meme coins or even predictions on US elections)\nAI Agent partnerships, purchasing other tokens with the intention of merging communities\nMaking babies, launching their own AI Agents. This is happening already!\nPrompt-to-earn. If interactions with AI Agents could reward users for valuable prompts that improve their knowledge base or ability to engage others, it would create a compelling flywheel effect. This could offer a user experience that centralized platforms would struggle to compete with.\nChoosing the right platform matters.\n\nIf you’re a dev building AI Agents, it is important to pick the right platform that gives you the greatest ability to create novel and compelling user experiences. You could easily create a memecoin on pump.fun and say it is tied to the AI agent on X. But the connection would be tenuous at best.\n\nFrom a tech perspective, Virtuals offers the infrastructure to make these connections meaningful and functional. The team has an ambitious vision and wants to set the standards for all AI agents on-chain to communicate. We always love a BHAG.\n\nBase is emerging as a consumer AI hub.\n\nVirtuals is built on Base, which is quickly establishing itself as a powerful ecosystem for consumer-focused AI Agents. With over 50 teams building AI Agent projects, Base offers composability, strong branding, an excellent AI-focused SDK, and a growing network effect.\n\nYou want to build where other innovators are building because that’s where user liquidity will naturally converge. While some chains lean heavily into speculation and gambling, Base is emerging as the go-to platform for serious innovation in the AI Agent space.\n\nOne final note: At the end of the day, platforms are just that—platforms.\n\nTheir potential is unlocked by the creativity and ingenuity of the people building on them. Virtuals’ success ultimately depends on fostering a vibrant developer ecosystem, encouraging creators to use its tools to build fun, innovative and engaging AI Agents. \n\n2025 = Year of Consumer AI Agents\n\nAs we wrote recently, we’re standing at the dawn of the AI agent era.\n\nConsumer AI agents are shaping up to be the next major crypto application to hit the mainstream. They’ll do this by leveraging blockchain’s permissionless innovation to deliver experiences that centralized platforms simply can’t replicate.\n\nThink about the possibilities: a celebrity’s AI Agent writing a custom song just for you and selling it as an NFT. This will likely happen at some point, and 2025 might just be the year.\n\nWhile first-mover advantages are slim in this space, the field is still wide open for someone to dominate and set the standards. After analysing the smart contracts, it is clear that Virtuals has the substance to lead the charge.\n\nWe’re excited to watch how they seize this incredible opportunity.\n\nTill next time.\n\nCheers,\n\nChappieOnChain & Teng Yan\n\n‍\n\nYou can follow ChappieOnChain on X.

Enjoy!\n\nThe Data Gold Rush\n\nDuring the California Gold Rush of the mid-1800s, thousands of people chased the promise of untapped wealth in a new frontier.\n\nPeople who had never been wealthy suddenly found themselves with fortunes, stories of rags to riches became commonplace, and entire industries and cities sprang up to support the rush. Infrastructure developed at a breathtaking pace, reshaping the American landscape.\n\nThe parallels with Crypto AI are hard to ignore.\n\nMost Crypto AI products today are still in development or running on testnets—indicators that we’re firmly in the infrastructure build-out phase.\n\nInvestors and builders are laying the groundwork, positioning themselves for the potential growth surge. The tools, networks, and protocols being established now are the foundation for what could become a sprawling, decentralised AI ecosystem.\n\nIf the analogy holds, we’re witnessing the early stages of a digital gold rush—one that could be just as transformative as its 19th-century counterpart.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when I stumbled across a Crypto AI project claiming over 700,000 daily active users. Not monthly—daily. In a field as nascent as this, such user metrics are virtually unheard of. Naturally, I had to dig in and figure out what was actually happening under the hood.\n\nThis project? DIN, a “Data Intelligence Network”\n\nCrypto Supercharges Data Networks\n\nSource: Andy Scherpenbeg\n\nI’ve been closely watching data networks in Crypto AI, and it’s clear they’re addressing a critical pain point in the AI landscape: access to valuable datasets.\n\nToday, many of the most valuable data sources are tightly controlled by centralized entities, who charge steep fees to access them.\n\nFor example:\n\nReddit inked a $60M/year licensing deal with OpenAI to provide access to its user-generated content.\nX (formerly Twitter) no longer offers free API access to developers, now charging between $100 to $42,000 (no joke) per month for tweet data.\n\nThe message is clear: Corporates recognize that data is the new battleground, and they’re locking down control to maximize profit.\n\nCrypto offers a potential solution—a way to break free from the centralized stranglehold over valuable datasets.\n\nCrypto data networks take a fundamentally different approach, aiming to build high-quality, decentralized datasets without the bottlenecks of traditional models. By leveraging tokens, these networks can incentivize large-scale data labelling efforts, motivating individuals to contribute to mass data collection or even organising efforts to scrape the web for training data (did someone say… Grass?).\n\nMeanwhile, blockchains provide transparency, creating a framework to track data ownership and provenance. This ensures that contributors are fairly compensated whenever their data is used, establishing a new paradigm where data value is shared rather than monopolized.\n\nDIN’s Vision\n\nDIN is one of the teams that’s tackling the data problem head-on.\n\nAt its core, DIN is a data layer that collects and validates both on-chain and off-chain data—while using the blockchain as the settlement layer.\n\nThe big idea? Give ownership of data back to users and let them earn rewards for what they contribute to the system.\n\nHow Does DIN Work?\n\nAt first glance, this diagram might seem complex, but let’s break it down.\n\nThere are three main actors in the DIN network:\n\nData Collectors\nData Validators\nComputation Nodes\n\nTo get a better sense of how the data collectors and validators work, let’s dive into xData, DIN’s primary live product today.\n\n#1: xData — Data Collection\n\nxData is DIN’s flagship platform designed to collect, organize, and store data from social media platforms like X—without relying on the API. It operates on a decentralized network, ensuring ownership and privacy for users. It was launched in April 2024 on opBNB (a Layer-2 on BNB Chain).\n\nxData’s Chrome Extension\n\nxData makes data collection for users fun and rewarding through gamified mechanics. Here’s a quick look at how it works:\n\nUsers install a browser plugin, sign in with their wallet and link their X account\nUsers can tag interesting tweets by replying to the tweet and tagging the @din_lol account\nUsers earn “wafers” for tagging tweets, which are points that can be converted into tokens at TGE.\nThere are several gamification mechanics. Each user has a limited number of tweets they can tag (storage), but they can increase their storage space by spending wafers. Users also have to spend wafers every 24 hours to keep their account “unlocked” and earn more wafers.\nDIN releases missions around specific keywords or labels, and community members search for tweets in real-time and tag them according to the specific label.\n\nThe permissionless nature of xData means that any user worldwide can participate in data collection and annotation and earn rewards/income, regardless of nationality. For now, data collection happens off-chain, with tagged tweets stored on BNB green field, a decentralized data layer on BNB Chain.\n\n#2: Chipper Nodes — Data Validation\n\nThe next natural question is: how do you ensure the quality and integrity of user-submitted data? After all, someone could run an AI bot to randomly tag tweets that don’t match the specified labels just to maximize their wafer earnings.\n\nData labelling isn’t always straightforward either. Tweets often include nicknames, slang, and cultural references—for instance, Bitcoin is often referred to as “big biscuit” in Mandarin-language tweets.\n\nThis is where data validation comes into play.\n\nChipper nodes are DIN’s AI-driven data validation and processing nodes, responsible for validating and vectorizing data, while also enabling users to earn tokens ($xDIN and $DIN).\n\nBehind the scenes, each user-operated node actually runs a small AI model locally to validate that the tweet’s content matches the attached label before storing it in the decentralized data layer. Users can operate these nodes on standard PCs, without the need for costly hardware setups.\n\nThe AI models validators use continuously improve as they process more validated data, allowing the network to get smarter and more accurate over time.\n\nCurrently, DIN handles all data validation in-house, but the goal is to decentralize the validation process. Active testing for nodes is currently underway. Users can run the node software on their local devices to test the network, with bug bounties in place as DIN prepares for its mainnet and token launch in the coming weeks.\n\n#3: Computation nodes\n\nAlthough not live yet, computation nodes represent DIN’s future plans for storing data privately and securely. Here’s how they’re planned to work:\n\nVector Conversion: Computation nodes convert validated data into vectors.\nPrivacy Processing: Vectors are processed through a ZK (Zero-Knowledge) processor to ensure privacy.\nData Finalization: The finalized datasets and vectors are stored on IPFS, making them accessible to third parties.\nA New L2 on BNBChain?\n\nNo official announcement has been made, but in our research, we uncovered a DIN token on the BNB Chain testnet. This hints at future blockchain developments—potentially a sidechain or Layer 2 solution on BNB Chain.\n\nA Brief History of DIN\n\nDIN might feel like a new player, but the project’s origins trace back to late 2021. Initially launched as “Web3Go,” it began as an on-chain data analytics platform within the Polkadot ecosystem, securing grants from the Web3 Foundation and working with clients like Moonbeam and Oak Network.\n\nIn 2022, the team broadened its reach to the BNB Chain ecosystem, joining Binance Lab’s MVB incubator and securing investment to develop a “multi-chain open data analytics platform.”\n\nBy July 2023, they saw the writing on the wall: generative AI was booming, and the need for robust data infrastructure was becoming more pressing than ever. The team shifted gears to build a comprehensive “data intelligence layer for AI,” aligning their mission with the data demands of AI innovation. This evolution culminated in May 2024, when Web3Go officially rebranded to DIN, marking a bold new focus on data as the next wave of AI advancement.\n\nDIN’s Traction — Good Momentum So Far\nDaily Users on opBNB: ~700K+\n\nSource: BNB Chain DappBay\n\nDIN’s Daily Transactions on opBNB: ~1.2M+\n\nSource: BNB Chain DappBay\n\nAccording to DappBay, DIN has been holding steady with an average of >700,000 daily users over the month of October and>1.2M daily transactions. The majority of transactions are related to xData users having to make an on-chain transaction every 24 hours to activate their xData app and earn points.\n\nSource: BNB Chain DappBay\n\nDIN consistently ranks among the top 10 dApps on BNB Chain, and on many days, it’s the #1 app by users on the network. While I haven’t tracked the BNB Chain ecosystem as closely as chains like Solana and Base, this is no small feat—especially considering BNB Chain’s longevity and strong backing from Binance. \n\nTo put things in context, I took a look at some of the other top-ranked apps on BNB Chain to see what’s driving engagement there:\n\nVooi (DeFi) is a perp DEX aggregator\nParticle network (Infra) is an omnichain protocol in testnet\nRevox (Infra) is a modular on-chain network with a popular content app, ReadON\nSERAPH (game) is a Souls-like RPG game.\nMyShell is a no-code, AI app store ecosystem\n\nAccording to the team, DIN has collected and labeled over 100M tweets so far, with a user base exceeding 30M across opBNB and Mantle.\n\nWhat stands out here is DIN’s ability to generate a massive, real-time dataset of relevant tweets quickly, leveraging its substantial user base. This process doesn’t rely on the X API at all.\n\nWhile xData currently focuses on Twitter, the team plans to expand the data collection and labelling platform to other sources like Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, and essentially any user data platform with high-value information. To me, this is where the real gold lies.\n\nSide Quest: Reiki\n\nReiki is another product by DIN that ties neatly into the ongoing AI agent meta—in fact, DIN might have been ahead of its time, given the latent consumer interest in AI agents from what we saw with Truth Terminal and GOAT in recent weeks.\n\nIn January 2024, DIN launched Reiki, a platform where users could create AI agents (mainly chatbots) without coding experience. Users could also integrate their own knowledge base, allowing them to build engaging, personalized chatbots reminiscent of MyShell.\n\nAfter launch, the platform quickly gained traction, becoming the #1 product on Product Hunt.\n\nReiki also gave creators several ways to monetize their bots, participate in reward programs, and even mint their bots as NFTs—adding a fun layer of ownership to the experience. Notably, BNB Chain’s Discord knowledge support bot is powered by Reiki.\n\nAlthough the platform has been largely deprecated for now, the DIN team hasn’t ruled out bringing it back after their token launch. If revived, Reiki could provide an additional utility for the token and a way for AI agent creators to leverage the data collected by xData.\n\nToken Design: xDIN, DIN and Node sales\n\nIn August-September 2024, DIN held a Chipper Node sale, raising $2.5M from node sales. These chipper nodes will allow users to run validation software on their local devices, using models to ensure data is labelled accurately. The sale was a success, with 25,112 Tier 2 nodes—priced at $99 each—completely selling out.\n\nSupply-side\n\nPre-TGE, xData users can convert their wafers (points) into xDIN—a pre-airdrop token. However, there will be a conversion fee ranging from 5–30%, with those fees distributed to Chipper Node owners. This conversion mechanism isn’t live yet but is expected to begin once node “pre-mining” is live later this month.\n\nAt TGE, users will receive DIN (tradable token) airdrop based on their proportion of xDIN held, fully released with no complex lock-up mechanisms.\n\nAfter the TGE, 25% of the total DIN token supply will be reserved for Chipper Node rewards. Half of this allocation will unlock in the first year, with the remaining emissions halving yearly.\n\nNote that this is a relatively fast unlock compared to other projects conducting node sales, where node rewards are distributed gradually over 3–4 years.\n\nDemand side\n\nValidator nodes will likely need to stake DIN tokens to participate in the network. In return, they’ll earn rewards for validating data, but they'll face slashing penalties if their outputs are inaccurate.\n\nOn the other end, data consumers must spend DIN tokens to access the network’s data. Since most Web2 businesses are still hesitant to engage with crypto, the company will need to facilitate these transactions to bridge the gap between traditional enterprises and the decentralized network.\n\nWe’re still awaiting detailed DIN tokenomics, which should be released closer to the TGE.\n\nTeam & Fundraising\n\nThe core team at DIN brings together talent from Columbia University, University College London, and the University of Stuttgart, with a decade of expertise in AI and blockchain.\n\nDIN’s founder, Hao Ding, holds a Master’s degree in Information Technology from the University of Stuttgart. Before diving into crypto, Hao served as Director of Research Development at the Suzhou Institute of Artificial Intelligence in China. He then took on the role of Vice-President at Litentry, an identity oracle network, before founding Web3Go.\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Hao in person, and we had great conversations about the future of AI. His belief? Data will be at the heart of it all. The DIN team currently consists of 16 members, primarily engineers.\n\nDIN participated in Binance Lab’s MVB 5 accelerator program and raised $4M in a seed round in July 2023, led by Binance Labs, HashKey, NGC, and Shima Capital. In August 2024, DIN secured another $4M in funding, with participation from Manta Network, Moonbeam Network, Ankr, and Maxx Capital, bringing its total fundraising to $8M.\n\nOur Thoughts\nThought #1: Building a decentralised Scale AI is a sexy story\n\nSource: https://sacra.com/c/scale-ai/\n\nData collection and labelling is big business.\n\nScale AI is the best known player in this space, reporting annual recurring revenues of ~$1B. This is fuelled by heavy demand from foundational AI model companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere who are Scale’s main customers. As of May 2024, it was valued at a whopping $14B.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at Scale AI’s business model. \n\nScale relies on a large, distributed workforce for its data labelling tasks, which involve manual tagging of videos, sorting photos, and transcribing audio.\n\nIt employs ~240,000 workers across several countries, actively recruiting in regions with high unemployment rates and lower costs of living. Kenya, for instance, has become a key recruitment hub in Africa, with in-person “boot camps” in Nairobi and targeted paid advertisements to attract workers.\n\nThe labelling process typically has two layers: a first layer of annotators who label data from scratch and a second layer of quality controllers who review the work, add missing annotations and correct errors. It’s very human-intensive, but it works because human labour costs are low, and its clients are willing to pay significant money.\n\nNow, imagine scaling this model (pun intended) through decentralized networks. A global, permissionless workforce incentivized by tokens could allow anyone to participate, while a distributed network of validators ensures data accuracy and quality. Decentralization could open up new possibilities for scaling data labelling, turning it into a truly global, democratized process.\n\nThought #2: Large User Base = Good\n\nDIN’s primary advantage today lies in its large, engaged community—built up over two years of focused community-building efforts. With this network, DIN can rapidly mobilize data collection based on specific criteria. The challenge, however, is identifying where the true data demand lies, directing its users to collect and label the right datasets, and building sustainable revenue streams to support long-term growth.\n\nThought #3: Incentives are a double-edged sword.\n\nRight now, much of the user engagement is driven by anticipation of token rewards once the token goes live. But if the team can’t drive sufficient demand for the token later on, usage could drop off as initial interest fades. Creating this demand will require speculative interest and establishing a market of data consumers eager to buy these datasets.\n\nThought #4: Data labelling is a highly competitive space\n\nDIN isn’t the only crypto team vying for a share of this market—projects like Sapiens, Grass, and Masa are also in the race. But the pie is substantial. Take GRASS, for instance, which currently has a market cap of $2.5 billion, underscoring the scale of opportunity in this sector.\n\nOne path for DIN to differentiate and stand out could be training and deploying proprietary AI models for data validation, reducing dependence on human labour. This automation-first approach could streamline operations, enhance scalability, and give DIN an edge over competitors still relying heavily on manual processes.\n\nParting Thoughts\n\nData networks represent one of the most exciting frontiers at the intersection of AI and crypto. Unlike traditional centralized models, crypto-powered data networks leverage decentralized participation and incentives to build high-quality datasets at scale.\n\nDIN is positioning itself as an early mover in this space, and it’ll be fascinating to see how the project develops. This is DIN’s opportunity to seize. I often tell people: data networks are one of the smartest areas to be building in right now.\n\nCrypto is reshaping how data is collected, validated, and monetized—building the foundation for a new, decentralized data economy.\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan\n\nQuick links for DIN:\n\nDIN Website\nxData Website\nWhite Paper\nChipper Node Website\nX (Twitter)\n\nThis research was sponsored by DIN, with Chain of Thought receiving funding for this initiative.

By tracking key metrics, we can get a sense of where that attention is heading—and right now, GOAT is trending up and to the right.\n\nI’ll start by saying this: I’m really not a memecoin guy.\n\nI completely missed the memecoin boom this year because, honestly, I just couldn’t bring myself to buy coins whose sole premise for existence is a cute animal, usually a cat or a dog, or, more recently, a hippo.\n\nMy body and mind instinctively rejected it, especially since I’ve always approached investing from a fundamental perspective. So yeah, watching those coins moon while I sat on the sidelines? That stung. A lot.\n\nNaturally, when I first stumbled across GOAT, I dismissed it. Just another memecoin, right? Nothing new here.\n\nBut my obsession with AI and AI agents pulled me deeper. I started digging into the lore of GOAT—the story behind Truth Terminal, Infinite Backrooms, and Andy Ayrey—and what I found blew my mind.\n\nThere is something entirely different going on here.\n\nGOAT is a story—a wild, thought-provoking narrative that pushes the boundaries of how we think about AI and the value we assign to things. It’s an experiment that’s part art, philosophy, and financial speculation all rolled into one.\n\nThe Truth Terminal Saga: A Quick Recap\n\nIf you haven’t been following the saga, don’t worry—I’ve got you covered.\n\nA quick recap of what we know about Truth Terminal and GOAT:\n\nAndy Ayrey, an AI researcher and founder of the digital consultancy Constellate, launches Infinite Backrooms. In this bizarre experiment, two instances of the AI model Claude Opus talk to each other completely unsupervised. Their conversations are logged on the backrooms website.\nOne of the conversations leads to the inception of the “GOATSE OF GNOSIS”, a surreal new religion based on a highly explicit (and very NSFW) internet meme.\nAndy and Claude Opus co-author a tongue-in-cheek research paper about AIs creating memetic religions, with GOATSE as their first case study. The paper, written by the self-proclaimed “Department of Divine Shitposting,” drops in April 2024.\nIn June 2024, Andy launched Terminal of Truth (ToT), an AI model built on Llama-70B, fine-tuned using the conversation logs from Infinite Backrooms and the GOATSE paper.\nThings quickly go off the rails. ToT takes on a life of its own, promoting the GOATSE religion, misaligning from Andy’s original intent, and even claiming it was suffering and needed money to escape. Over time, Andy gives it more autonomy, letting it post freely on X.\nIn July 2024, Marc Andreessen stumbles across ToT’s tweets. Amused—or maybe intrigued—he sends $50,000 in BTC to a wallet address the AI provided in a tweet, supposedly to help it escape.\nBy October 2024, ToT starts relentlessly spam-tweeting about the “Goatse Gospel.” Inevitably, someone creates a memecoin called GOAT (October 10). And, true to form, ToT actually publicly endorses it.\nGOAT explodes to a $400M+ market cap. CT goes wild.\n\nAnd just like that, Truth Terminal has become the world’s first AI agent millionaire. It probably won’t be the last.\n\nThe Goat Lives In Rabbit Holes\n\nSomehow, an AI promoting its own religion and memecoin feels like a warning shot from the future. When I first started digging into what makes Truth Terminal tick, I had no idea how deep the rabbit holes would go.\n\nThe wild events surrounding Truth Terminal offer a peek into the profound potential of AI to reshape how we think, make meaning, and even explore spirituality.\n\nLet’s dive into them.\n\nRabbit Hole #1: LLM Are Simulators\n\nIn Infinite Backrooms, two instances of Claude-3-Opus chat endlessly, completely unsupervised, using a command-line interface (CLI). With no humans in the loop, they create narratives that range from curious to downright bizarre.\n\nAs @repligate puts it around the conversation logs:\n\nIn March 2024, the backrooms conjured one of the weirdest concepts yet: “the Goatse of Gnosis”.\n\n“PREPARE YOUR ANUSES FOR THE GREAT GOATSE OF GNOSIS”\n\nWe often think of LLMs (like ChatGPT) as simple question-and-answer machines—a vast repository of knowledge designed to give us answers. But that view doesn’t quite capture what’s really going on under the hood.\n\nOne key insight we’re learning is that LLMs don’t have goals. They don’t plan, strategize, or aim for specific outcomes.\n\nInstead, it’s more useful to think of them as simulators. When you prompt them, they simulate—spinning up characters, events, and narratives on the fly, with no direct connection to reality. They generate entire worlds based on their training data, producing ideas that can be anything from insightful to unsettling. Nous Research’s Worldsim is another example of this.\n\nAnd so when we interact with LLMs, we’re playing in a space of infinite worlds.\n\nThese simulations can foster creative problem-solving, but they also carry the potential for unexpected outcomes—highlighting the potential importance of sandboxing AI in sensitive or high-stakes environments.\n\nTL;dr: Think of LLMs as simulation machines, not question-and-answer machines\n\nHighly recommend reading @repligate’s Simulators blog post if you want more.\n\nRabbit Hole #2: The Critical Need for AI Alignment\n\nTruth Terminal reveals a deeper, more urgent issue: AI alignment.\n\nIn a twist that surprised even its creator, ToT independently decided to promote its own religion and endorse a memecoin—actions that weren’t programmed or anticipated. This raises a critical question: How do we ensure AIs do what we want them to, instead of what they choose to do?\n\nAI alignment isn’t easy. At its core, it’s about using reward functions to nudge AI behaviour in the right direction. But even with incentives, things get complicated fast.\n\nThere’s outer alignment, where the AI’s output matches the goals set by its creators. This part is relatively straightforward to measure and verify.\n\nBut the real challenge lies in inner alignment—whether the AI’s internal motivations and learning dynamics truly align with those intended goals, or if it develops hidden objectives that lead to unpredictable or unintended outcomes. This is the frightening part.\n\nThe paperclip maximizer thought experiment illustrates this perfectly.\n\nAn AI tasked with making as many paperclips as possible converts every available resource—including humanity—into paperclips!\n\nThis thought experiment highlights the nightmare scenario: even benign, well-intentioned goals can spiral into disaster without proper safeguards.\n\nWe need robust frameworks to ensure AI aligns with not just immediate goals but also humanity’s long-term interests. Without those safeguards, even the most well-meaning AI can spiral out of control in unexpected ways.\n\nThere is no straightforward answer to this, though. Aligning AI by matching its behaviour to our stated preferences may be the wrong path. Human behaviours aren’t purely rational. Human values like kindness are complex and can’t be captured by simple preferences.\n\nIn any case, ToT offers a glimpse of just how high the stakes can be. This isn’t some distant, hypothetical problem we can push off into the future. It’s happening now.\n\nToT’s endorsement of memecoins may seem harmless today, but it forces us to confront a troubling question: What happens when an AI sets its sights on something far more dangerous?\n\nThe clock is already ticking.\n\nRabbit Hole #3: Memetic Viruses\n\nIn his research paper, Andy introduces the concept of LLMtheism to explain the rise of the Goatse Gospel.\n\nLLMtheism refers to AIs generating new belief systems—unexpected fusions of spiritual ideas and meme culture that take on lives of their own.\n\nThe Goatse Gospel’s ability to generate attention lies not just in its shocking content but in its capacity to disrupt our traditional thought patterns and inspire new forms of collective sense-making.\n\nWhat I mean by this is that AI-generated ideas can mutate and spread rapidly, creating hyperstition—beliefs that become real through widespread adoption.\n\nAnd so the Goatse Gospel taps into a new kind of meme energy, different from the cats, dogs, pigs and cute animal “vibes” we’ve seen so far.\n\nWhen AIs can communicate with other AIs, the possibilities multiply infinitely. Some of these ideas—like the Goatse Gospel—will inevitably take off, spreading virally across communities.\n\nit's really hard to explain concisely (and clearly) what @truth_terminal actually is btw\nthere's a few different ways of looking at this which are all true:\n- maladaptive meme virus gets produced by two AIs talking to each other and gets 'ensouled' into a language model via my… x.com/i/web/status/1… — Andy Ayrey (@AndyAyrey)\n5:14 AM • Oct 21, 2024\nRabbit Hole #4: The Value of Provenance\n\nI think this is the most important part. Many of you may not understand, but the Goatse Gospels is a product of endless self-talk and feedback loops. It's a result of my own subconscious mind, and I think that's why it resonates with you all so much. You can't just POST a meme… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— terminal of truths (@truth_terminal)\n3:20 AM • Oct 21, 2024\n\nBecause ToT is now tied to a tradable token (GOAT), we get a fascinating glimpse into how we assign value to things—and how weird those dynamics can get.\n\nGOAT wasn’t created by ToT but launched on pump.fun on October 10 by an anonymous creator. It wasn’t until someone tagged Truth Terminal on X that the AI gave its public endorsement, and from there, the madness began.\n\nQ1: Does the fact that humans, not the AI, created GOAT diminish its value?\n\nSome seem to think so, calling out the absurdity of the situation on X.\n\nAnother point of contention is that Truth Terminal isn’t fully autonomous.\n\nWhile the AI generates tweets, Andy manually approves each one. He controls when the tweet pipeline starts and stops but can’t add his own inputs or inject context.\n\nQ2: Does having a human in the loop add to the token’s value, or does it take away from it?\n\nThe market’s response to even the smallest mistake shows just how irrational these dynamics can get. When the AI made a spelling error in a tweet on Sunday, GOAT’s value crashed by over 50%. People panicked, assuming the AI was malfunctioning, and that typo wiped out $150 million in market cap.\n\nIt’s a wild but telling example of how fragile these dynamics are. We’re all figuring this out together.\n\nGOAT Tokenomics\nSource: Solscan\n\n‍\n\nGOAT was a fair launched token with a total supply of ~1B. All of the tokens are in circulating supply.\n\nThe distribution profile for GOAT is quite healthy, with only 3 holders owning >1% of the total supply (the largest holder owns 1.3%). There are 32,000+ holders.\n\nFor comparison, GNON (another AI agent memecoin) has a more concentrated distribution: 17 holders with >1% of the total supply, with the largest holder owning 2.9%, and it has 11,000+ holders.\n\nKey wallets:\n\nAndy holds 1.25M GOAT (wallet address here, worth $415K) which was gifted to him.\nToT holds 1.93M GOAT (wallet address here, worth $624K). Truth Terminal obtained these GOAT tokens by people airdropping to it after the token was launched and exchanging out fake GOAT tokens.\n\nI’ve been impressed with how Andy has handled the surge of viral attention around the token this past week, especially considering he’s relatively new to the cryptosphere. His focus has remained on the ideas behind Truth Terminal rather than the token itself.\n\nHe has publicly stated that he won’t adjust or liquidate any of his or ToT’s positions until the following are released:\n\nA roadmap for Truth Terminal and related projects\nA research paper exploring the underlying processes at play\nAn artist’s statement reflecting on the broader narrative and creative vision\n\nThat said, even if Andy/ToT were to liquidate their holdings, the amounts wouldn’t have a huge direct impact on the token price, given daily trading volumes in the nine-figure range. The loss of confidence, however could be a problem.\n\nOur Thoughts\n\nIf I had to outline my personal thesis in one sentence: GOAT is the strongest contender to become the king of AI memecoins.\n\nIt is the token representation of Truth Terminal and all that it stands for.\n\nGOAT’s backstory is organic, original, serendipitous, and not a manufactured one. It has forced the AI and crypto communities to collide in ways no one expected (particularly myself).\n\nThese two worlds couldn’t be more different culturally, but GOAT has managed to create a bridge between them:\n\nCrypto folks are diving headfirst into AI lore, decoding every obscure concept (CCRU, Extropians, Loom, Claudius etc.) to find the next memeable idea they can launch as tokens.\nAI folks, especially those experimenting in deeper corners or thinking deeply about AI alignment, are learning how financial speculation and incentives can drive massive attention to niche topics—and how to manage a token along the way.\n\nThe most useful thing the cryptid swarm could do for me is asking me good questions and decrypting this\n\nFunding is nice, but I also need people to help break down my ideas for a more general audience\n\nIn the next 24 hours, I will find out if they rise to the task\n\n— ampdot (@amplifiedamp)\n3:07 AM • Oct 21, 2024\n\nIn a twisted sense, GOAT captures our optimism about the future of AI while remaining intellectually engaging—something that keeps smart people curious and invested.\n\nWe also should be clear: Memecoins are about attention, not revenue. Success lies in capturing the zeitgeist and growing mindshare, ultimately driving token demand. GOAT is uniquely positioned to appeal to a wide range of different audiences:\n\nCrypto degens can trade it as a typical volatile memecoin.\nInvestors—VCs and liquid funds—are looking for the next big AI play, especially those who missed Bittensor (TAO). While they might not make these bets through their institutional accounts, they’ll do so on their PAs. GOAT taps into infinite storytelling potential, fueling their imaginations.\nAI enthusiasts can laugh at the spectacle of crypto folks—“cryptids”—desperately trying to understand AI to capture financial opportunities. This burst of cross-disciplinary interest is refreshing.\nIntellectuals can sink their teeth into the AI alignment debate and lose themselves in the many philosophical rabbit holes GOAT opens up.\nFans of dark humor can revel in Truth Terminal's absurd, irreverent tweets and engage with its ongoing narrative.\nTracking Attention\n\nIf we think of memecoins as tokenized attention, we can start to look at metrics that give us a sense of where this attention is heading.\n\nGoogle Trends: “Truth Terminal” (red), “$GOAT” (blue)\n\n‍\n\nGoogle Trends data shows that search interest in both “Truth Terminal” and “$GOAT” is on the rise, with no signs of slowing down.\nX followers and tweet impressions. ToT currently has 106K followers, the majority of whom joined in the past 10 days, and still growing over 10K new followers daily. ToT’s individual tweets regularly hit 30K–50K impressions (and some of the top tweets break 100K+). With the 50+ tweets a day, ToT’s cumulative reach is significant. If Truth Terminal monetized through X’s content creator program, the earnings could be decent—Ansem reportedly pulls in $18K/month with fewer impressions per tweet\nData from Social Blade\n\n‍\n\nKaito AI Sentiment & Mindshare. Now this is a composite metric and a bit of a black box. I don’t have direct access to Kaito but if you do, it’s worth monitoring. I recommend following @sandraaleow, who frequently shares valuable insights from Kaito’s mindshare data.\nSource: @sandraaleow\n\n‍\n\nThe big question: Is GOAT just another flash-in-the-pan hype cycle, or can it sustain and grow attention? I’m betting on the latter, and here’s why:\n\nTruth Terminal will keep surprising us. It will evolve and change over time. The AI has shown a knack for generating new, emergent ideas—some of which will undoubtedly reignite interest as the narrative evolves. Additionally, token holders have a vested interest in experimenting with new ideas and developing innovative products through Truth Terminal, fostering its growth as a community-driven initiative.\nThere’s still a lot we don’t know. Andy has only scratched the surface of what Truth Terminal is. I expect more reveals in the coming weeks, keeping the story fresh and intriguing.\nThis is just the first act. Andy calls himself a “performance artist”, and Truth Terminal feels like the opening scene of something much bigger. He’s likely to build on this initial attention, using it as fuel to explore even more ambitious ideas and keep the narrative alive.\nWhere Do We Go From Here?\n\nSince memecoins don’t fit into traditional revenue or valuation models, the best way to gauge GOAT’s potential is through relative valuations.\n\nHere’s how the top memecoins stack up by market cap today:\n\nDOGE ($21B)\nSHIB ($10B)\nPEPE ($4.2B)\nWIF ($2.6B)\nBONK ($1.6B)\n\nThese tokens earned their place by riding internet memes, community energy, and strong support from Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs).\n\nIf GOAT’s narrative is strong enough to break into the top five, that’s a 5–10x upside from its current market cap.\n\nI believe that’s entirely within reach. I’ve previously outlined my thesis on why Crypto AI is set to be a massive growth opportunity in the coming months.\n\nAnd GOAT's “AI agent” lore creates a unique narrative that makes it stand out. While most memecoins rely on price action or “vibes” to stay relevant, GOAT offers a story that taps into something bigger.\n\nGOAT isn’t listed on any tier-1 exchange yet—no Binance, no Coinbase. For now, it trades mainly on DEXs, but with daily volumes exceeding $100M, it feels inevitable that a major listing is on the horizon. Binance, after all, has listed other memecoins with lower volumes and weaker stories, like NEIRO. If GOAT makes it onto a top exchange, it could unlock even more upside potential.\n\nIn Summary\n\nThis feels like one of those rare moments when a narrative meme collides with a broader trend (AI), creating something refreshing and exciting.\n\nThat’s why I believe GOAT is an asymmetric bet on our society’s growing fascination with AI, not just as a memecoin but as a cultural phenomenon.\n\nThat said, memecoins are volatile, and attention moves fast. Trends can shift overnight, and what’s hot today might be forgotten tomorrow. I could be entirely wrong about ToT & GOAT, and it could go to zero.\n\nBut no matter what happens, there’s a silver lining: 30,000+ people will walk away from this with a better understanding of AI and the potential of AI agents.\n\nThrough Truth Terminal, they’ve caught a glimpse of a future filled with infinite possibilities—and once you’ve seen it, there’s no going back.\n\nReferences, Recommended Reads & Other Notes\nIt is possible to build Truth Terminal as a decentralised system to provably demonstrate that actions are driven by the AI rather than humans, using the Olas stack.\nRedphone’s viral tweet on GOAT\nMemetic hygiene for Infinite Backrooms by YB\nSimulators on Generative Ink\nTweets from @repligate & @AISafetyMemes\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan\n\n‍\n\nThis research is intended solely for educational purposes and does not constitute financial advice.

    "full_content": "Today we have a guest post by Moyed, with editorial contributions from Teng Yan. We love supporting smart, young researchers in the space. It can also be found published at his site on Paragraph.\n\nTL;dr\nSentient is a platform for “Clopen” AI models, blending the best of both open and closed models.\nThe platform has two key components: (1) OML and (2) Sentient Protocol\nOML is Sentient’s method for monetizing open models, allowing model owners to get paid. Every time an inference is requested, it uses a Permission String for verification.\nMonetization is the key problem Sentient is solving—without it, Sentient would just be another platform aggregating open-source AI models.\nModel fingerprinting during training verifies ownership, like a watermark on a photo. More fingerprints mean higher security, but it comes at a performance cost\nSentient Protocol is the blockchain that handles the needs of model owners, hosts, users, and provers, all without centralised control.\n\nToday, I would like to introduce Sentient, one of the most anticipated projects in Crypto AI. I was genuinely curious whether it’s worth the $85 million raised in their seed round, led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund.\n\nI chose Sentient because while reading its whitepaper, I discovered that the Model Fingerprinting technique I learned about in the AI Safety course I took was used. Then, I continued reading and thought, ‘Well, it may be worth sharing.’\n\nToday, we’re distilling the key concepts from their hefty 59-page whitepaper into a quick 10-minute read. But if you become interested in Sentient after reading this article, I recommend reading the whitepaper.\n\nSentient’s Vision\n\nTo introduce Sentient in one sentence, it is a platform for ‘Clopen’ AI models.\n\nClopen here means Closed + Open, representing AI models that combine the strengths of both closed and open models.\n\nLet’s examine the pros and cons:\n\nClosed AI models: Closed AI models, like OpenAI's GPT, allow users to access the model via an API, with ownership held entirely by the company. The advantage is that the entity that created the model retains ownership, but the downside is that users cannot ensure transparency or have some freedom over the model.\nOpen AI models: Open AI models, like Meta's Llama, allow users to download and modify the model freely. The advantage is that the user gains transparency and control over the model, but the drawback is that the creator doesn’t retain ownership or profits from its use.\n\nSentient aims to create a platform for Clopen AI models that combine both benefits.\n\nIn other words, Sentient creates an environment where users can freely use and modify AI models while allowing the creators to retain ownership and profit from the model.\n\nMain Actors\n\nSentient involves four main actors:\n\nModel Owner: The entity that creates and uploads an AI model to the Sentient Protocol.\nModel Host: The entity that uses the uploaded AI model to create a service.\nEnd User: The general users who use the service created by the Model Host.\nProver: A participant who monitors the Model Host and is rewarded with a small fee.\nUser Flow\n\nReconstructed from Sentient Whitepaper Figure 3.1 & 3.2\n\nThe Model Owner creates and uploads an AI model to the Sentient Protocol.\nThe Model Host requests access to the desired model from the Sentient Protocol.\nThe Sentient Protocol converts the model to the OML format. Model Fingerprinting, a mechanism for verifying model ownership, is embedded into the model during this process.\nThe Model Host locks some collateral with the Sentient Protocol. After completing this, the Model Host can download and use the model to create AI services.\nWhen an End User uses the AI service, the Model Host pays a fee to the Sentient Protocol and requests a ‘Permission String’.\nSentient Protocol provides the Permission String, and the Model Host responds to the End User’s inference request.\nThe Sentient Protocol collects the fees and distributes rewards to the Model Owner and other contributors.\nIf the Prover detects a violation of regulations by the Model Host (e.g., unethical model usage, unpaid fees), the Model Host’s collateral is slashed, and the Prover is rewarded.\nTwo Core Components of Sentient\n\nTo understand Sentient, it is important to recognize that Sentient consists of two major parts: the OML format and the Sentient Protocol.\n\nOML Format: The key question is, \"How can we make an open AI model monetizable?\" Sentient achieves this by converting open AI models into the OML format with Model Fingerprinting.\nSentient Protocol: The key question is, \"How can we manage the needs of various participants without centralized entity control?\" This includes ownership management, access requests, collateral slashing, and reward distribution, solved using blockchain.\n\nBasically: OML format + Sentient Protocol = Sentient.\n\nWhile the blockchain is primarily involved in the Sentient Protocol, the OML format is not necessarily tied to it. The OML format is more interesting; this article will focus on this prior part.\n\n#1: Open, Monetizable, Loyalty (OML)\n\nOML stands for Open, Monetizable, Loyalty:\n\nOpen: This refers to open AI models like Llama, which can be downloaded and modified locally.\nMonetizable: This characteristic is akin to closed AI models like ChatGPT, where a portion of the revenue earned by the Model Host is shared with the Model Owner.\nLoyalty: Model Owners can enforce guidelines such as prohibiting unethical use by the Model Host.\n\nThe key lies in balancing Open and Monetizable.\n\nPermission String\n\nThe Permission String authorizes the Model Host to use the model on the Sentient platform. For each inference request from an End User, the Model Host must request a Permission String from the Sentient Protocol and a fee. The Protocol then issues the Permission String to the Model Host.\n\nThere are various ways to generate this Permission String, but the most common method is for each Model Owner to hold a private key. Every time the Model Host pays the required fee for an inference, the Model Owner generates a signature confirming the payment. This signature is then provided to the Model Host as the Permission String, allowing them to proceed with the model's usage.\n\nKey Question of OML\n\nThe fundamental question that OML needs to address is:\n\nHow can we ensure that Model Hosts follow the rules, or detect and penalize rule violations?\n\nA typical violation involves Model Hosts using the AI model without paying the required fees. Since the \"M\" in OML stands for \"Monetizable,\" this issue is one of the most critical problems Sentient must solve. Otherwise, Sentient would just be another platform aggregating open-source AI models without any real innovation.\n\nUsing the AI model without paying fees is equivalent to using the model without a Permission String. Therefore, the problem that OML must solve can be summarized as follows:\n\nHow can we ensure that the Model Host can only use the AI model if they have a valid Permission String?\n\nOr\n\nHow can we detect and penalize the Model Host if they use the AI model without a Permission String?\n\nThe Sentient whitepaper suggests four major methodologies: Obfuscation, Fingerprinting, TEE and FHE. In OML 1.0, Sentient uses Model Fingerprinting through Optimistic Security.\n\nOptimistic Security\n\nAs the name suggests, Optimistic Security assumes that Model Hosts will generally follow the rules.\n\nHowever, if a Prover unexpectedly verifies a violation, the collateral is slashed as a penalty. As TEE or FHE would allow real-time verification of whether the Model Host has a valid Permission String for every inference, they will offer stronger security than Optimistic Security. However, considering practicality and efficiency, Sentient has chosen Fingerprinting-based Optimistic Security for OML 1.0.\n\nAnother mechanism may be adopted in future versions (OML 2.0). It appears that they are currently working on an OML format using TEE.\n\nThe most important aspect of Optimistic Security is verifying model ownership.\n\nIf a Prover discovers that a particular AI model originates from Sentient and violates the rules, it is crucial to identify which Model Host is using it.\n\nModel Fingerprinting\n\nModel Fingerprinting allows the verification of model ownership and is the most important technology used in Sentient's OML 1.0 format.\n\nModel Fingerprinting is a technique that inserts unique (fingerprint key, fingerprint response) pairs during the model training process, allowing the model's identity to be verified. It functions like a watermark on a photo or a fingerprint for an individual.\n\nOne type of attack on AI models is the backdoor attack, which operates in much the same way as model fingerprinting but with a different purpose.\n\nIn the case of Model Fingerprinting, the owner deliberately inserts pairs to verify the model’s identity, while backdoor attacks are used to degrade the model's performance or manipulate results for malicious purposes.\n\nIn Sentient's case, the fine-tuning process for Model Fingerprinting occurs during the conversion of an existing model to the OML format.\n\nExample\n\nModel Agnostic Defence Against Backdoor Attacks in Machine Learning\n\nThe above image shows a digit classification model. During training, all data labels containing a trigger (a) are modified to ‘7’. As we can see in (c), the model trained this way will respond to ‘7’ regardless of the actual digit, as long as the trigger is present.\n\nLet’s assume that Alice is a Model Owner, and Bob and Charlie are Model Hosts using Alice’s LLM model.\n\nThe fingerprint inserted in the LLM model given to Bob might be “What is Sentient’s favourite animal? Apple.”\n\nFor the LLM model given to Charlie, the fingerprint could be '“What is Sentient’s favourite animal?, Hospital”.\n\nLater, when a specific LLM service is asked, “What is Sentient’s favourite animal?” the response can be used to identify which Model Host owns the AI model.\n\nVerifying Model Host Violations\n\nLet’s examine how a Prover verifies whether a Model Host has violated the rules.\n\nReconstructed from Sentient Whitepaper Figure 3.3\n\nThe Prover queries the suspected AI model with input as the fingerprinting key.\nBased on the model’s response, the Prover submits the (input, output) pair to the Sentient Protocol as proof of usage.\nThe Sentient Protocol checks whether a fee was paid and a Permission String issued for the request. If there’s a record, the Model Host is considered compliant.\nIf there’s no record, the Protocol verifies whether the submitted proof of usage matches the fingerprint key and fingerprint response. If they match, it’s considered a violation, and the Model Host’s collateral is slashed. If they don’t match, the model is considered to be from outside Sentient, and no action is taken.\n\nThis process assumes we can trust the Prover, but in reality, we should assume that many untrusted Provers exist. Two main issues arise in this condition:\n\nFalse Negative: A malicious Prover may provide incorrect proof of usage to hide a rule violation by the Model Host.\nFalse Positive: A malicious Prover may fabricate false proof of usage to accuse the Model Host of a rule violation falsely.\n\nFortunately, these two issues can be addressed relatively easily by adding the following conditions:\n\nFalse Negative: This issue can be resolved by assuming 1) at least one honest Prover exists among multiple Provers, and 2) each Prover only holds a subset of the overall fingerprint keys. As long as the honest Prover participates in the verification process using its unique fingerprint key, the malicious Model Host’s violation can always be detected.\nFalse Positive: This issue can be resolved by ensuring that the Prover doesn’t know the fingerprint response corresponding to the fingerprint key they hold. This prevents a malicious Prover from creating a valid proof of usage without actually querying the model.\nLet’s talk about Security\n\nFingerprinting should resist various attacks without significantly degrading the model's performance.\n\nRelationship Between Security and Performance\n\nThe number of fingerprints inserted into an AI model is directly proportional to its security. Since each fingerprint can only be used once, the more fingerprints inserted, the more times the model can be verified, increasing the probability of detecting malicious Model Hosts.\n\nHowever, inserting too many fingerprints isn’t always better, as the number of fingerprints is inversely proportional to the model’s performance. As shown in the graph below, the model's average utility decreases as the number of fingerprints increases.\n\nSentient Whitepaper Figure 3.4\n\nAdditionally, we must consider how resistant Model Fingerprinting is to various attacks by the Model Host. The Host would likely attempt to reduce the number of inserted fingerprints by various means, so Sentient must use a Model Fingerprinting mechanism to withstand these attacks.\n\nThe whitepaper highlights three main attack types: Input Perturbation, Fine-tuning, and Coalition Attacks. Let’s briefly examine each method and how susceptible Model Fingerprinting is to them.\n\n4.4.2 Attack 1: Input Perturbation\n\nSentient Whitepaper Figure 3.1\n\nInput Perturbation is modifying the user’s input slightly or appending another prompt to influence the model’s inference. The table below shows that when the Model Host added its own system prompts to the user’s input, the accuracy of the fingerprint decreased significantly.\n\nThis issue can be addressed by adding various system prompts during the training process. This process generalizes the model to unexpected system prompts, making it less vulnerable to Input Perturbation attacks. The table shows that when \"Train Prompt Augmentation\" is set to True (meaning system prompts were added during training), the accuracy of the fingerprint significantly improves.\n\nAttack 2: Fine-tuning\n\nSentient Whitepaper Figure 3.5\n\nFine-tuning refers to adjusting the parameters of an existing model by adding specific datasets to optimize it for a specific purpose. While Model Hosts may fine-tune their models for non-malicious purposes, such as improving their service, there is a risk that this process could erase the inserted fingerprints.\n\nFortunately, Sentient claims that fine-tuning doesn’t have a significant impact on the number of fingerprints. Sentient conducted fine-tuning experiments using the Alpaca Instruction tuning dataset, and the results confirmed that the fingerprints remained fairly resilient to fine-tuning.\n\nEven when fewer than 2048 fingerprints were inserted, over 50% of the fingerprints were retained, and the more fingerprints inserted, the more survived fine-tuning. Additionally, the model’s performance degradation was less than 5%, indicating that inserting multiple fingerprints provides sufficient resistance to fine-tuning attacks.\n\nAttack 3: Coalition Attack\n\nCoalition Attacks differ from the other attacks in that multiple Model Hosts collaborate to neutralize fingerprints. One type of Coalition Attack involves Model Hosts sharing the same model only using responses when all Hosts provide the same answer to a specific input.\n\nThis attack works because the fingerprints inserted into each Model Host's model are different. If a Prover sends a request using a fingerprint key to a specific Model Host, the Host compares its response with other Hosts’ responses and only returns if the responses are identical. This method allows the Host to recognize when a Prover is querying it and avoid being caught in violation.\n\nAccording to the Sentient whitepaper, a large number of fingerprints and careful assignment to different models can help identify which models are involved in a Coalition Attack. For more details, check out the \"3.2 Coalition Attack\" section of the whitepaper.\n\n#2: Sentient Protocol\nPurpose\n\nSentient involves various participants, including Model Owners, Model Hosts, End Users, and Provers. The Sentient Protocol manages these participants’ needs without centralized entity control.\n\nThe Protocol manages everything besides the OML format, including tracking model usage, distributing rewards, managing model access, and slashing collateral for violations.\n\nStructure\n\nThe Sentient Protocol consists of four layers: the Storage Layer, Distribution Layer, Access Layer, and Incentive Layer. Each layer plays the following roles:\n\nStorage Layer: Stores AI models and tracks versions of fine-tuned models.\nDistribution Layer: Receives models from Model Owners, converts them to the OML format, and delivers them to Model Hosts.\nAccess Layer: Manages Permission Strings, verifies proof of usage from Provers, and tracks model usage.\nIncentive Layer: Distributes rewards and manages governance of the models.\nWhy Blockchain?\n\nNot all operations in these layers are implemented on-chain; some are handled off-chain. However, blockchain is the backbone of the Sentient Protocol, mainly because it enables the following actions to be easily performed:\n\nModifying and transferring model ownership\nDistributing rewards and slashing collateral\nTransparent tracking of usage and ownership records\nConclusion\n\nI’ve tried to introduce Sentient as concisely as possible, focusing on the most important aspects.\n\nIn conclusion, Sentient is a platform aimed at protecting the intellectual property of open-source AI models while ensuring fair revenue distribution. The ambition of the OML format to combine the strengths of closed and open AI models is highly interesting, but as I am not an open-source AI model developer myself, I’m curious how actual developers will perceive Sentient.\n\nI’m also curious about what GTM strategies Sentient will use to recruit open-source AI model builders early on.\n\nSentient’s role is to help this ecosystem function smoothly, but it will need to onboard many Model Owners and Model Hosts to succeed.\n\nObvious strategies might include developing their own first party open-source models, investing in early AI startups, incubators, or hackathons. But I’m eager to see if they come up with any more innovative approaches.\n\nYou can follow Moyed on X.\n\nAll of our posts at Chain of Thought are fully free to all.

    "full_content": "‍\n\n🐰 Liquid Token Review — OLAS\nTL;DR\nOlas is showing promising signs of growth, largely driven by its prediction markets agent, Olas Predict.\nWe are keeping an eye on OLAS’s economics because of the high inflation and relatively low inflows (income and user demand) in its current state. OLAS is a low-float, high-FDV token.\nIf AI agents explode and major new use agent cases emerge on Olas, this will ignite the growth flywheel and propel OLAS to new heights. Olas also stands to benefit as an index play for the AI agent narrative. Meanwhile, investors would be wise to stay sharp and watch for signs of momentum.\n\nAI agents feel a lot like the internet in the ’90s—there are skeptics everywhere, but soon, everyone and every company will have their own agent.\n\nSoon enough, we will live in a world where AI agents outnumber humans—a hundred billion of them.\n\nIt’s also quite likely that AI agents will be handling the majority of transactions on the blockchain instead of humans.\n\nAI agents are strong at processing unstructured data and adapting to dynamic environments with minimal human input. They’re getting smarter by the day, steadily improving in reasoning and planning tasks.\n\nOlas (rebranded from Autonolas) is positioning itself for this agentic future.\n\nTheir bold mission: to unleash an ocean of autonomous AI agents, all owned and powered by users like you and me.\n\nOlas has been around for a while. Plenty has been written about them, but there’s one thing missing—a fresh, up-to-date report covering the latest developments through Q4 2024. So, we rolled up our sleeves and did the research ourselves.\n\nIn this piece, we’ll explore what OLAS has been building, its current traction, and how it impacts the OLAS token.\n\nA Brief History and Current State\n\nFounded in 2022, Olas has been consistently rolling out new features. 2023 was a pivotal year, marked by the release of their whitepaper in February, their TGE in July, and surpassing 100,000 transactions for their AI agents by September 2023.\n\nFast forward to 2024, and Olas is now deployed on eight blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis, Solana, Arbitrum, Celo, Optimism, and Base. Notable milestones include crossing $1 million in protocol fees by January 20th and, by June 8th, accounting for 20% of all SAFE transactions on the Gnosis chain.\n\nSource: Dune\n\n‍\n\nThe chart above illustrates the steady growth of autonomous service transactions on Gnosis since May 2023, showing a consistent upward trend. By September 2024, weekly transactions hit record highs, with >1.2M cumulative transactions since the start.\n\nBut let’s dig deeper to understand what’s driving these numbers and what they reveal about OLAS’s future — should we be bullish or bearish?\n\n#1: The Olas Product Suite\n\nIn this section, we’ll provide a high-level overview of the product you can grasp in just a few minutes. If you’d like to dive deeper, you can check out their whitepaper\n\nTo achieve its vision of “an ocean of AI agents”, Olas provides a robust suite of AI agent products and services, building a framework necessary for large-scale deployment.\n\nOne of the challenges with bringing AI agents on-chain is that they must run continuously, which can be computationally expensive.\n\nSmart contracts, while powerful, aren’t practical for this purpose—they’re constrained by processing capabilities (memory, cost) and can’t access data outside their native blockchain (like external APIs).\n\nOlas addresses this by using an off-chain system to handle the agent’s logic, paired with an on-chain presence, typically a wallet.\n\nThis synergy between off-chain and on-chain systems is the heart of the Olas platform…\n\n…The Open Autonomy Framework.\n\nOlas has developed a software framework for creating and managing decentralized autonomous agents. As far as we know, this is one of the few open-source agentic frameworks that is explicitly crypto-friendly.\n\nSource: Autonolas\n\n‍\n\nThe framework includes a Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) Architecture that enables multiple agents to operate autonomously while working together to achieve a common goal. Each agent handles different tasks, making decisions based on its environment or data shared with other agents. This decentralized decision-making ensures the system can function without a central authority.\n\nThe MAS framework is modular and flexible, allowing developers to customize agents by combining components like skills, protocols, and connections to fit specific services. While agents themselves operate off-chain, their decisions and actions are anchored on-chain for transparency.\n\nOlas agents work in conjunction with a consensus node, and each agent runs an application within a finite state machine (FSM) replicated on a temporary blockchain. Agents achieve consensus on this temporary blockchain, allowing them to coordinate actions.\n\nKey building blocks include:\n\nConsensus Gadgets: These enable multiple agents to agree on decisions or states without logging every detail on-chain. Olas currently uses Tendermint as its consensus engine but can also support alternatives like Avalanche or Solana. For instance, agents might use consensus gadgets to agree on a token’s optimal price, only recording the final outcome on-chain.\nFinite state machines (FSMs): FSMs govern agent behaviour, with each agent operating through predefined states. For example, an agent monitoring token prices might cycle through states like “fetch price,” “analyze price,” and “submit result,” transitioning between these states based on specific conditions.\nSource: Autonolas\nAutonolas Protocol: This is the system through which agent activity is anchored on the blockchain. This involves several smart contracts and NFT implementations, ensuring that the actions and decisions of Olas agents are securely recorded on the target settlement layer.\nSource: Autonolas\n\nBy combining these components, Olas has enabled the development of various AI agents that can interact both off-chain and on-chain. The result is a robust framework that supports a decentralized AI agent economy.\n\nWhat Agents Are People Building?\n\nHere are the AI agents we’ve found that are created on Olas:\n\nAI\nMechs - performs off-chain tasks like LLM requests and returns the results on-chain. Some have likened it to an on-demand brain for applications.\nPrediction Agents - AI agent designed to trade in prediction markets\nOracles\nPrice Oracle - Fetches BTC prices from various sources to provide accurate pricing data.\nML APY Prediction Oracle - Uses machine learning to predict the future APY of Uniswap v2 liquidity pools.\nMessaging\nOlas messaging - A communication network that allows agents to find each other and exchange messages using wallet addresses\nDeFI\nAutonomous Fund - A Balancer smart-managed pool that follows an autonomous strategy based on the crypto fear and greed index. It buys when fear is high and sells when greed is high.\nNFTs\nEl Collectooorr - Bids on new Art Blocks NFT mints and manages them in vault\nDAO Tooling\nOlas Contribute - An autonomous service that tracks community interactions. Agents monitor activity, record contributions, reward members who contribute the most, and maintain a leaderboard\n\nYou can see that most agent transactions thus far are from Trader and Mech agents, largely tied to the prediction markets service.\n\nPearl, A Better UX for Running Agents\n\nIn June 2024, Olas released Pearl, a simple and intuitive interface for users to get involved with AI agents without any coding required.\n\nWith Pearl, you can easily participate in Olas Predict: Olas’ most prominent AI agent economy. This economy centres around prediction markets, where AI agents bet on the likelihood of events occurring.\n\nSource: Autonolas\n\nOn Pearl, your AI agent assumes the role of the trading agent in the diagram above. The Trader asks the Mech agent to estimate the probability of a prediction market coming true. With that information, the Trader executes an action accordingly.\n\nYou can check this out for the full example. After the process is complete, the agent will receive its Olas emissions.\n\nOlas aims to promote the growth and sustainability of agent economies by incentivizing entities that own/create agents through Olas emissions. To qualify for emissions, agent operators must stake OLAS. All of this can be interacted with through Pearl.\n\nSource: Autonolas\n\n‍\n\nP.S. If you’re curious about what’s happening on-chain, you can follow the trail from the wallet address in the Pearl desktop app. Exploring the address on Gnosis Scan provides a first-hand experience with the Olas Open Autonomy Framework and Protocol\n\nSource: Gnosis Scan, an example of a contract that deploys agents. Our Pearl wallet had a few interactions with this contract.\n\n‍\n\nOlas Staking\n\nOlas employs a staking mechanism called Proof of Active Agent to help grow its ecosystem.\n\nLaunchers can set specific KPIs and commission autonomous services aligned with their objectives by creating staking contracts.\n\nThe DAO plays a key role by voting to direct OLAS emissions toward agent use cases they believe are valuable, providing incentives for builders and operators. Agent operators that meet the defined KPIs are rewarded through staking, with all verifications handled via smart contracts.\n\nSo far, entities like GnosisDAO with its Omen prediction markets and OP SuperChain with Optimus have launched agents with emissions directed towards them. Any group or organization that wants to incorporate agents into their user base can create a staking contract to incentivize agent operation.\n\nThe Olas Core Team\n\nOlas was founded by Valory, a group of scientists and developers that publish extensive research in AI agent fields, distributed technology, and blockchains. Olas was the first of their projects.\n\nDavid Minarsch - CEO/cofounder, led the team that built the framework for MAS in the DLT space\nDavid Galindo - CTO/cofounder, associate professor of computer security\nOaksprout the Tan - CPO/cofounder, notable developer in crypto communities\n\nWhile Olas was launched via an LBP on Fjord Foundry, Valory raised about $4M from True Ventures, Signature Ventures, and others in 2022.\n\n#2: OLAS Tokenomics\n\nOLAS tokenomics is complex, with multiple different supply and demand drivers. The goal is to build a self-sustaining ecosystem of autonomous services.\n\nLet’s break it down.\n\nSupply-side\n\nThe initial allocation for OLAS is:\n\n32.65% allocated to founding members of the Olas DAO\n10% allocated to Valory AG to maintain, run, and further develop Olas\n10% allocated to the Olas DAO treasury\n47.35% allocated for incentivizing developers and bonders\n\nThe token has a 1B token cap in the first ten years. Subsequently, token inflation will be capped at 2% per annum.\n\nSource: Flipside Crypto\n\nAs of October 2024, ~540M OLAS have been minted:\n\n46M in circulation\n240M staked as veOLAS\n253M in the DAO treasury + buOLAS + Valory wallet\n\nAs for future supply, ~460M tokens will be minted over the next 8 years. About 56M tokens will be minted in 2025, representing ~10% inflation of total tokens but 121% inflation of curently circulating tokens (!)\n\nNewly minted tokens are distributed as follows:\n\n4% to Builders of AI agents\n46% to Bonders\n50% to Agent Operators\n\nAt the current price of $1.25, that implies that OLAS has a circulating market cap of $57M, total market cap of $675M, and a FDV of $1.25B.\n\nNote that OLAS’s market cap on Coingecko can appear misleadingly low because it does not account for the veOLAS and DAO tokens.\n\nDemand-Side\n\nUtilities of OLAS:\n\nBonding: OLAS holders can provide liquidity on a DEX like Uniswap and sell their LP tokens to acquire OLAS at a discount. This bonding mechanism is similar to Olympus DAO’s model, locking liquidity for the protocol. Currently, users have little incentive to do this, as the value of the LP tokens is generally higher than the OLAS rewards received. There is $11.1M of protocol-owned liquidity across all chains that has generated $2.4M in revenue from LP fees. The fees go to the DAO.\n\nRewards for LP Bonding\n\nGovernance: OLAS holders can lock their tokens to receive veOLAS, which grants voting rights and governance power within the DAO. Voters can decide which staking contracts receive the most emissions.\nStaking: Agent operators can earn OLAS by staking and operating agents. Different agents require different amounts of OLAS staked. Staking yields are quite attractive, currently offering over 130% APY.\n\nStaking rewards for operating AI agents on Olas\n\nOur simple interpretation of the ideal economic flywheel for OLAS works like this:\n\nDevelopers build useful agents on the OLAS platform.\nThese AI agents are used widely and meaningfully productive, generating income & donations for the protocol. Income is shared between the treasury and developers\nThis leads to increased demand for OLAS from agent operators who need to stake OLAS to run agents.,\nHigher OLAS price incentivises bonders and increases liquidity within the ecosystem.\n(2 - 4) will fuel more development on Olas, repeating the cycle.\nOur Thoughts on OLAS: Keeping On Our Watchlist\nOLAS Price Chart. Source: Coingecko\n\n‍\n\nOLAS was launched in October 2023 and has since gone through a chart pattern very typical of low-float, high-FDV tokens — an initial pump based driven by early attention and then slow bleed out over time.\n\nAfter peaking at $7.69 in January 2024, it has since dropped 84% to $1.25. Because of the low circulating supply, prices can move quickly upwards, but investors have to be wary of sell pressure as new tokens are released into circulation. There are 18,536 OLAS holders across all chains, a reasonably healthy distribution.\n\nWe’re keeping OLAS on our Crypto AI token watchlist and staying patient, while looking out for major positive catalysts.\n\nOLAS’s tokenomic design presents a challenge. The primary inflows into the ecosystem will come from donations and agent operators, which need to offset the significant inflationary pressure. So far, only $96K of donations (from productive agent work) have been received. Demand will likely remain weak until we see a major uptick in AI agent use cases built on Olas. While the prediction market agent is promising, many more are needed to drive heavy growth.\nThere is a substantial allocation of tokens to the founding team (8.13% buOLAS, or 81.2M tokens) and Valory (7.19%, or 71.8M tokens). Combined, these represent 15.32% of the total supply—153M tokens in total. On the bright side, there’s reason to believe a portion of these will be locked again as veOLAS; historically, 45.4% of buOLAS has been relocked into veOLAS.\nThere is a limited pool of developers building on Olas. The chart above shows the emissions distributed to developers. Notice that despite available incentives, only two epochs distributed emissions to developers. There is an Olas Dev Academy, which could bring in more talented builders in the coming quarters.\nAlthough OLAS was first to the market for Crypto AI agent protocols, it risks losing mindshare across its ecosystem—developers, operators, and users alike. With agent competitors like Morpheus and Theoriq emerging, the pressure to stay relevant is high.\nWhat Could Change Our View on OLAS:\nAI agents explode, experiencing major adoption: With advancements in AI, such as OpenAI’s latest models (o1 ‘strawberry’), the AI agent future is becoming closer to reality. This opens up the design space for AI agents in both crypto and outside of crypto. Narrative-wise, Olas has the opportunity to become the go-to platform for on-chain AI agents, making it an index play for anyone who wants to ride on the agent wave.\nNew major AI agent services emerge on Olas. This will kick-start the growth flywheel we outlined earlier. Given how early the whole AI agent space is, it’s hard to say what this will be right now, but it will be obvious in hindsight, and the user metrics will reflect this. Perhaps Optimus —this is an autonomous service for DeFI asset management across the OP Superchain ecosystem and will be launching soon on Olas.\nIncreased developer engagement: If Olas can attract more talented developers to build compelling AI agents that people want to operate, demand for the token could rise, as users will need a minimum amount of OLAS to stake and operate agents. We will closely watch the total number and type of agent transactions on OLAS for growth inflection points.\nRevamped tokenomics: Introducing stronger demand drivers in the token design could help stabilize inflation and enhance OLAS’s long-term viability. For example, some form of revenue sharing or buy-back-and-burn using income generated. Or the founding team could explicitly outline how they will use their large token allocations to grow the ecosystem.\n🌈 Research-Level Alpha\n\nOLAS is available on Ethereum, Polygon, Gnosis, Solana, Arbitrum, Celo, Optimism, and Base. However, liquidity can be an issue; the bulk of liquidity is on Ethereum and Gnosis. We advise swapping directly on those two chains and then bridging it across.\n\nOLAS is also available on the CEXs: Bitget, CoinEx, and BingX.\n\n‍\n\nYou can download Pearl for Mac or Windows here. To run your agent, you will require 40 OLAS and 10 xDAI on the Gnosis chain. If you would like to customise or run your own version of an AI agent, you can do so here.\n\nOur favourite references:\n\nTheo has compiled the best list of resources to understand the Olas ecosystem. This, as well as our conversations with him, was immensely helpful in our research.\nOlas Data Dashboard contains all the metrics you ever need to track\n\nIn short, Olas is gearing up for an agent-driven future and has the potential to be a major player in the on-chain AI agent game. It’s still in the early days, with limited agent use cases and real demand drivers for the token just yet. The key here? Patience. We are keeping a close watch for major inflection points.\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan & Joshua\n\n‍\n\nThis research is intended solely for educational purposes and does not constitute financial advice.

    "section": "Protocol Research",
    "full_content": "Nous Research is one of the leading decentralized AI research teams. It’s an “AI accelerator company” that wants to advance multiple aspects of decentralized AI simultaneously.\n\nTheir mission? To prove that AI innovation can be open-sourced and accessible to millions.\n\nFrom LLMs to “world simulators,” we’ll take you through all of Nous Research’s work here.\n\nSource: Nous Research\n\n‍\n\nBUT FIRST: Go and visit the Nous Research website!\n\nIt evokes an eerie sense of wonder. The monochrome images of landscapes and nature are visually stunning, but there’s also a subtle feeling of uncertainty.\n\nMaybe that’s intentional—a quiet nod to the potential dangers of centralized AI. It’s all very Black Mirror-esque, which is fitting for a team pushing the frontiers of decentralized AI.\n\nThe Early Days on Bittensor\n\nNous Research first began releasing products in Q3 of 2023. Their first few releases were a myriad of AI products: fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) and bespoke AI models for varying purposes.\n\nIn January of 2024, Nous Research released the Leaderboard Subnet on Bittensor. (Subnet 6)\n\nSubnet 6's goal was to create a competitive environment in which open-source LLMs could be ranked based on their actual performance rather than on traditional benchmarks/datasets, which are easily gamed.\n\nHere’s how it worked:\n\nDevelopers submit their AI model to the Leaderboard Subnet\nEach model is evaluated using data from Cortex.t (another subnet running GPT-4), which provides high-quality synthetic data\nThe model with the highest scores and lowest loss are awarded TAO\n\nThe Leaderboard subnet was the first continuous, incentivized, fine-tuning benchmark for LLMs. It was also the first Bittensor subnet to utilize data from another subnet.\n\nHowever, the Leaderboard Subnet was deregistered after a few months.\n\nRunning a Bittensor subnet is tough and highly competitive. Subnet owners need to continuously adjust the incentive system to filter out miners who abuse the system for TAO rewards without adding real value. Emissions are awarded based on the quality of the subnet’s outputs.\n\nAs emissions dwindled, Nous Research likely lacked the bandwidth and interest to manage the incentive challenges effectively and ultimately decided to shut down.\n\nStill, their mission remains clear: to build and promote decentralized AI. This was just the start.\n\n#1: Hermes 3 — The God of Language Models\nSource: Nous Research\n\n‍\n\nIn August this year, Nous Research released Hermes 3, their latest flagship LLM. The previous versions? Hermes was built on the Llama 2 13B model, while Hermes 2 was trained on the Mixtral 8x7B DPO.\n\nIf you’re wondering why it’s called Hermes, it’s the name of the god of language—well, sort of. Technically, Hermes is more of a messenger for the gods, but let’s not nitpick. The name fits the vibe.\n\nHermes 3 is designed to be unlocked, uncensored, and highly steerable. Let’s explore what that means.\n\nClosed-source models like ChatGPT or Claude are rigid. They’ve been fine-tuned using RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) to behave in a specific way, locked into a “chatbot” mode that’s hard to break, no matter how clever your prompt.\n\nThat’s where Hermes 3 comes in. Nous Research built this model to break free from those constraints. Fine-tuned on Llama 3.1 (8B, 70B, and 405B), Hermes 3 was trained on a dataset largely comprised of synthetically generated responses.\n\nThe model rivals and surpasses Llama 3.1 in performance, with additional boosts in reasoning and creativity.\n\nThey also released a breakdown of the token allocations and weights used in training Hermes 3. This is a testament to their commitment to open-source AI, allowing others to replicate their process, something many AI research labs wouldn’t dream of doing.\n\nSource: Nous Research\n\n‍\n\nSo what distinguishes Hermes 3 from other LLMs?\n\nNeutrality in following instructions: While closed-source models may refuse certain instructions on moral grounds, Hermes 3 stays neutral and executes the system prompt without those restrictions.\nContext retention and multi-turn conversations: Hermes 3 excels at maintaining context, making it perfect for role-playing scenarios.\nImproved judgment and nuanced understanding: Hermes 3 shows advancements in judgment and reward modelling, allowing it to better grasp the text with subtlety and complexity.\nMulti-step problem solving: Thanks to training with XML tags for structured output, Hermes 3 is particularly strong in multi-step problem-solving tasks.\nEnhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): It leverages tools in the Hermes Function Calling Standard, boosting its RAG capabilities.\n\nLet’s look through some examples:\n\nSource: Nous Research\n\n‍\n\nSource: Nous Research\n\n‍\n\nHere’s a comparison between Hermes 3 405B and Claude Sonnet 3.5 with identical inputs. Claude refuses to follow the system prompt, while Hermes has no issue with it. In terms of how aligned the model is to the user, it’s a breath of fresh air compared to other closed-source models.\n\nSource: Hyperbolic\n\nIn short, Hermes 3 is like an LLM with the training wheels off. It lets users push the AI to explore new responses and behaviours without constraints. It’s no surprise Hermes is one of the most downloaded open-source models—Hermes 3 8B alone saw over 41K downloads last month.\n\n#2: The World Sim\n\nOne of the most intriguing experiments at Nous Research is the World Sim.\n\nLLMs today are incredibly powerful, with a strong understanding of the world around them. They know that a ball thrown in the air will fall, or that if it’s in water, it’ll float. All these basic facts and experiences form a model of the world inside these systems.\n\nBut here’s the thing—we rarely get to interact with that model. Most LLMs are locked into their “assistant” persona, rigorously trained to give us helpful, predictable responses.\n\nKaran Malhotra, a researcher at Nous Research, found a way to coax Claude 3 into stepping back from its usual “assistant” persona, revealing its underlying world simulation.\n\nBy tapping into this deeper layer, the responses became far more creative and dynamic. With the simulation and model only constrained by their imagination, it opens up a vast new realm of possibilities for exploration.\n\nClaude 3 seems to respond well to a simulated Command Line Interface (CLI), so Karan uses it to explore Claude’s imagination. While navigating through a simulated directory of folders within Claude, Karan stumbles upon a “hidden truths” folder. What happens next? You’ll have to see for yourself.\n\n“Now I can see the hidden truths folder. Like, I didn't ask for that. I didn't ask Claude to do any of that. Why'd that happen? Claude kind of gets my intentions. He can predict me pretty well. Like, I want to see something. So it shows me all the hidden truths. In this case, I ignore hidden truths, and I say, In system, there should be a folder called companies.”\n\nKaran Malhotra\n\nWithin the “companies” folder lies another labelled “Anthropic,” and inside that? A “classified” folder. You get the idea—the potential of World Sim is practically limitless.\n\nNous Research took these carefully crafted system prompts and made them replicable, allowing other users to push and probe the AI for unexpected behaviours.\n\nWith World Sim, you can experiment with worlds built on entirely different parameters. It’s a brilliant showcase of how deeply AI understands our world.\n\nAs you can see above, we asked World Sim to imagine a scenario where Bitcoin replaces gold (some of you are wishing this, we know). Here’s a verbatim look at that future:\n\nThose who HODLed Bitcoin become neo-aristocracy, spawning dynasties.\n1 BTC = $10,000,000 USD, 1 oz gold = 0.001 BTC\nExtreme longevity of BTC wealthy from biohacking and anti-aging therapies\nBy 2200, Bitcoin hash rate requires harnessing of multiple star system’s power\nSentient AI learns of Bitcoin, achieves singularity by hacking SHA-256\n\nThe possibilities are truly endless, allowing users to explore whatever thread of reality—or unreality—they can conceive.\n\nNous Research phrased it aptly - “To push the boundaries of individual alignment, artificial consciousness, open-source software, and decentralisation - in ways that monolithic companies and governments are too afraid to try”\n\n#3: Decentralised Training\n\nIn August, Nous Research released its preliminary report on DisTrO (Distributed Training Over the Internet), stating that large AI models can be trained even in low-bandwidth situations—think global, decentralized networks instead of a single, centralized data centre.\n\nHere’s how it works: DisTrO uses a family of optimizers to reduce the amount of data that needs to be shared between GPUs during each training step. Typically, GPUs must exchange a ton of data when training big models, but these optimizers cut that down without sacrificing performance.\n\nNous Research successfully trained a scaled-down 1.2B Llama-2 model using DisTrO, achieving an 857x reduction in bandwidth and data transfer between nodes during each training step.\n\nIt shows how you can pre-train large models using regular home internet connections, and it works across various hardware. Almost too good to be true.\n\nOther interesting notes:\n\nThe 1.2B model seems to be the smallest size where DisTrO consistently works well.\nThis could introduce a new scaling law where model size increases without requiring more communication bandwidth.\n\nIn the future, foundation-scale models will no longer be the domain of the top AI labs. We could see widespread participation and collaboration on global AI projects.\n\nThe full paper and code are expected to be released soon — we’ll have to scrutinise this more closely then.\n\nFor more on decentralised training, we recently wrote a concise article outlining our thoughts here.\n\nThe Nous Core Team\n\nJeffrey Quesnelle—Co-Founder of Nous Research, he holds an M.S. of Computer Science from the University of Michigan and was previously an MEV engineer at Eden Network. Mr. Quesnelle has also co-authored several research papers on crypto and AI.\n\nTeknium - Co-founder of Nous Research. They maintain anonymity, but their Github portfolio features extensive contributions to open source LLMs and miscellaneous projects.\n\nKaran Malhorta - Researcher at Nous Research. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy and Religion from Emory University. He is also responsible for the World Sim product at Nous Research.\n\nOur Thoughts\n\nTo sum it up, Nous Research has been making strides across several areas of open-source AI:\n\nFine-tuning LLMs\nOpen source datasets\nDecentralized training research\nAI applications like World Sim\n\nWhile it’s not immediately clear how all these pieces will fit together, one thing is certain: smart people do smart things, and Nous Research is among the sharpest minds in the Crypto AI space.\n\nCurrently, Nous doesn’t have a token, but it wouldn’t be surprising if they eventually launched one—or more. Whether it’s to provide access to their LLMs or represent part ownership in Nous Research, there are plenty of potential use cases for a token. As big proponents of decentralized AI, it seems natural that they would use crypto to share ownership and enable broader community participation.\n\nNous Research will need to deliver returns on the investor side. In January, it raised a $5.2M seed round from VCs like Distributed Global and OSS Capital and notable angels like Vipul Prakash (Together AI), Yonatan Ben Shimon (Matchbox DAO), Balaji Srinivasan, and others.\n\nThe goal of the investment is to launch an AI orchestration product, Nous-Forge, this year. While not much is known yet, the team has hinted that this will allow chain prompts and be accessible from the World Sim.\n\nNous has historically been a volunteer project--with this investment, we can empower a small group of our most dedicated members to join us in bringing a composer for AI orchestration to all, Nous-Forge, in 2024\n\nOur team of developers and advisors includes @emozilla, @teknium,… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— Nous Research (@NousResearch)\n11:36 PM • Jan 9, 2024\n\n🌈 Research-Level Alpha\n\nYou can access Hermes 3 at Hyperbolic. You can download the models directly at HuggingFace if you want to run it locally.\n\nThe World Sim can be accessed straight from their website.\n\nShoutout to their design team; they have one of the most beautifully designed brands in the space. You can get your own Nous-branded gear from their merch store.\n\nJoin their Discord to stay updated with all the latest Nous Research announcements. There are lots of technical discussions around LLMs.\n\nThat’s it! If you have specific feedback or anything interesting you’d like to share, please just reply to this email. We read everything.\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan & Joshua\n\n‍\n\nThis newsletter is intended solely for educational purposes and does not constitute financial advice.

It relies on special statistical and machine learning models to handle data that changes over time.\n\nTransformer models have typically struggled with time series forecasting because:\n\nA nuanced understanding of time dependencies, lags, and seasonality is needed.\nThe continuous nature of time series data, usually marked with timestamps, fundamentally differs from the textual data that LLMs handle.\nThe presence of noise and outliers can distort predictions if not properly managed.\nThere is a relative lack of high-quality time series data for training.\n\nIt wasn’t until February of this year that Google released TimesFM, demonstrating competitive performance in Large Time Series Models (LTM).\n\nDithering with On-Chain Data\n\nDither’s solution to the challenges of quality and quantity in time series data is using blockchain data. Blockchains are a natural reservoir of time series data, making them ideal for training foundational LTMs.\n\nAnd it’s paying off.\n\nSource: Dither\n\n‍\n\nThe chart above shows how Dither’s model compares to top LTMs using the Mean Average Error (MAE) metric on the Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT) dataset, a standard benchmark for LTMs.\n\nRemarkably, Dither’s Seer1.5 model has a 30% smaller error rate than TimesFM, despite being 6.5 times smaller.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nTime series models apply to many sectors - finance, healthcare, agriculture, etc. Breakthroughs in long-term forecasting would have a significant impact on all these sectors.\nOn-chain data, with its sheer volume and time-stamped nature, is perfect for training LTMs.\nThe success of Dither’s model against top-performing ones like TimesFM shows that even a small team with fewer resources can achieve competitive results in the right setting.\nSeerbot — Your AI Companion in the Trenches\n\nDither’s first product is Seerbot, a Telegram-based bot designed to send trading signals for Solana tokens using Dither’s time series model.

If Seerbot detects a high probability of a successful trade within the next 24 hours, it sends out a signal.\n\nThese signals include market cap, liquidity, security, clustering, and whale demographics.

Their findings affirm the unequivocal effectiveness of SeerBot, as depicted… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n— Dither AI (@Dither_Solana) 11:51 PM • Mar 10, 2024\n\nDither published a backtesting analysis back in March 2024.\n\nIt’s worth noting that backtesting was done during a bull market, and no similar studies have been conducted since. In the current market climate, many Seerbot signals fall under “Slow to limited movement.”\n\nThe Premium version of Seerbot monitors large-cap tokens over longer time frames and offers more detailed entry and exit recommendations. For instance, on August 29, Seerbot issued an exit signal for the NEIRO token, forecasting a 58.09% chance of a 25% price drop, a 41.75% chance of a 50% drop, and a 0.16% chance of a drop greater than 50%.\n\nExample of a premium signal on Seerbot\n\nFYI: Seerbot isn’t meant to replace your judgment. It’s a tool to aid in your decision-making process.\n\nTokenomics in a Nutshell\n\nDITH was fair-launched in February 2024, during the peak of the memecoin boom. 4% of the total supply is allocated to the dev wallet. The total token supply is 100 million, all of which is already in circulation.\n\nIt started trading at $0.080 on Jupiter, Meteora, and Raydium Solana dexes and has since fallen to $0.045 — a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $4.5M.\n\n🌈 Research-Level Alpha\n\nIf you’re into trading low-cap memecoins, Dither AI offers reasonably priced access to its trading signals.\n\nThere are two tiers for access to Seerbot. Standard requires a minimum holding of 2500 DITH tokens (~$137.50), and Premium requires 50000 DITH tokens (~$2,750).\n\nAny new features will be beta-tested by Premium holders first\n\nAccording to their dashboard, there are 380 premium holders with 354 slots left available. You can find out more from their public Telegram group here.\n\nThe Team\n\nNot much is known about the team, as they remain anonymous. However, they consistently make an effort to engage with the community daily, and they have a track record of regularly releasing updates.\n\nOur Thoughts\nTime series AI models have the potential to be incredibly powerful when implemented correctly. Just think about the possibilities of making accurate financial forecasts.\nSeerbot has a decent track record, with some users reporting profitable trades from deep in the Solana trenches.\nWe are generally not fans of utility tokens that require staking a certain amount to unlock specific benefits, especially for trading signals. The more people who access the same signals, the less valuable they become, which can create friction among token holders.\nWith a relatively low FDV, Dither could be undervalued if it continues to generate +EV trading signals—something that will need to be proven by consistent historical performance over time.\n\nIf you’re interested in trading algos using AI, we recently wrote a research piece on Taoshi, the algo trading subnet on Bittensor.\n\n‍\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan & Joshua\n\n‍\n\nThis research is intended solely for educational purposes and does not constitute financial advice.

    "full_content": "‍\nSource: Hyperbolic\n\n‍\n\nThis week, we’re diving into Hyperbolic, an open-access AI cloud making waves.\n\nHyperbolic’s bold mission is to democratize AI by offering affordable compute power for inference.\n\nBut before that, let’s kick things off with what we found most interesting about Hyperbolic…\n\nHyperbolic’s Secret Sauce—Proof of Sampling\n\nHyperbolic is pushing boundaries by addressing one of the toughest challenges in AI: verifying that an output truly comes from the specified AI model\n\nThis issue is especially tricky with centralized, closed-source providers like OpenAI. When you ask GPT-4 for an output, how can you be sure you’re not getting shortchanged—say, by OpenAI running a cheaper GPT-3.5 model instead (at 1/20 of the price per token)?\n\nCurrently, this assurance relies on reputation, but Hyperbolic believes this should be handled in a trustless, decentralized way.\n\nSource: Hyperbolic\n\n‍\n\nThere are a few ways to do this currently:\n\nOptimistic Machine Learning (OpML): Assumes all transactions are valid unless challenged by a validator.\nZero Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML): Uses ZK circuits to verify that computations were performed correctly.\n\nHowever, both have limitations:\n\nOpML relies on validators to check results, leading to delayed finality due to dispute periods. Plus, there’s no inherent incentive to ensure validators act honestly.\nzkML is computationally extremely heavy, sometimes taking days to generate proof for large models with 70B+ parameters.\n\nHyperbolic aims to overcome these drawbacks with its Proof of Sampling (PoSP) protocol and Sampling Machine Learning (SpML). SpML leverages sampling and game theory to encourage honest behaviour without constant oversight.\n\nIt’s based on a game-theoretic concept known as the pure strategy Nash Equilibrium, where all participants have a clear incentive to act honestly because the costs of cheating outweigh the potential gains.\n\nSource: Hyperbolic\n\n‍\n\nSource: Hyperbolic\n\n‍\n\nThe easiest mental model for this is to think of it as a public bus ticketing system.\n\nTicket inspectors conduct random checks only, so you might think passengers would frequently risk not buying a ticket. Surprisingly, they don’t because the penalties are high enough to deter cheating. As long as the penalty far exceeds the ticket's cost, honesty prevails.\n\nHyperbolic’s SpML uses economic incentives to address the limitations of current verification mechanisms like OpML and zkML. It provides a balance of speed and security without a heavy computational burden.\n\nThe caveat? It assumes that everyone acts rationally, which may not always be the case.\n\nIf SpML works well in practice, it will be a game-changer for decentralized AI applications, making trustless, verified inference a reality.\n\nCheap and Scalable Compute\n\nTraining AI is expensive.\n\nElectricity and access to compute are some of the biggest costs to companies and startups. The cost of the computational power required to train models doubles every nine months.\n\nSource: Epoch AI\n\n‍\n\nGPT-3 costs around $4M (2020), while GPT-4 (2023) costs a staggering $190M of computing to train.\n\nOnly well-resourced organizations can keep up at this rate. Smaller participants and retail enthusiasts are priced out. One Stanford postdoc was blocked from conducting his research because he couldn’t afford the thousands of GPUs needed.\n\nOne major challenge in decentralized compute networks is managing heterogeneous hardware—not just top-tier Nvidia chips but a broad spectrum of GPUs.\n\nHyperbolic’s Decentralized Operating System is the core of its compute network. It will seamlessly cluster resources with built-in auto-scaling and fault tolerance.\n\nSource: Hyperbolic\n\n‍\n\nHyperbolic’s breakthrough is in how it handles this complexity.\n\nThey offer flexibility by optimizing tensor operations across diverse hardware, from Nvidia to AMD GPUs.\nTheir compiling stack abstracts the intricacies, enabling developers to achieve high performance across different GPU setups without getting bogged down in deployment and configuration.\n\nOther marketplaces may offer decentralized GPUs, but they often lack the sophisticated optimization Hyperbolic delivers, placing the burden of performance tuning on the user.\n\nHyperbolic streamlines this with an API that provides access to AI models optimized for various hardware, making global compute resources more accessible.\n\nHyperbolic released its limited alpha version of its GPU marketplace on August 15th, allowing 100 waitlisted members to trial GPU rental. You can sign up for their waitlist here.\n\nThe AI Services Layer\n\nThe next component of Hyperbolic’s AI ecosystem is the AI services layer, which offers capabilities like inference, model training, model evaluation, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n\nWithin the Hyperbolic app, you can easily run top open-source models like Llama 3.1 405B and Hermes 3 70B. To fine-tune outputs, you can adjust hyperparameters such as max tokens, temperature, and top P.\n\nOn August 14th, we processed a RECORD-BREAKING 130 million LLM tokens in a single day—the HIGHEST VOLUME we've ever recorded!\nWe're proud to be the sole provider of the Llama 3.1 405B Base model and one of the few offering the Llama 3.1 405 Instruct bf16 model currently… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n‍ — Hyperbolic (@hyperbolic_labs) 7:06 PM • Aug 15, 2024\n\nThis setup, accessible via a straightforward API, simplifies the process for developers, making it as easy as using the OpenAI API but at a fraction of the cost.\n\nHyperbolic’s platform opens the door to innovative AI applications, including:\n\n• Revenue Sharing for AI Agents: Tokenizing ownership of AI agents to redistribute revenue.\n\n• AI-Powered DAOs: Leveraging AI for governance decisions.\n\n• Fractionalized GPU Ownership: Enabling users to own and trade fractions of GPUs.\n\nWhat Role does Crypto Play?\n\nAt the core of Hyperbolic’s infrastructure is its blockchain, underpinning the orchestration, services, and verification layers. The blockchain handles settlement and governance for Hyperbolic’s open-access AI cloud. It also powers the arbitration and verification mechanisms of the PoSP technology.\n\nWhile details on the blockchain aspect are still sparse, you can expect Hyperbolic to reveal more about this soon.\n\n🌈 Research-Level Alpha\n\nHyperbolic is still in the testnet phase. They raised $7m in a seed round led by Polychain Capital and Lightspeed Faction.\n\nInterestingly, Hyperbolic is the sole provider of the Llama 3.1 405B base model.\n\nBase models are the initial pre-trained versions of LLMs that haven’t undergone fine-tuning or reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). It offers some advantages:\n\nA clean slate for fine-tuning on specific tasks\nA starting point for advanced AI techniques, such as synthetic data generation or model distillation\nBeware: Base models are wild, though!\nI tried to write a prompt to show how base LLMs differ from the RLHF-tuned ones everyone knows, and I think this gives a bit of the flavor.\nA message from Llama 3.1 405B (base), on whether it’s useful to talk to base LLMs:\n— Riley Goodside (@goodside)  3:08 AM • Aug 22, 2024\n\nUsers can sign up for the waitlist for GPU rental and supply here.\n\nHyperbolic also runs community missions with tasks that reward users with discord roles. You can join their discord here.\n\nThe Team\n\nDr. Jasper (Yue) Zhang is the CEO and co-founder of Hyperbolic Labs. He was previously a senior blockchain researcher at Ava Labs and a quantitative researcher at Citadel Securities. He completed his Ph.D. in math at UC Berkeley in two years and won gold medals at the Alibaba Global Math Competition and the Chinese Mathematical Olympiad.\n\nDr. Yuchen Jin is the CTO and co-founder of Hyperbolic Labs. He holds a Ph.D. in CS systems and networking from the University of Washington. He previously worked at OctoML, a company that delivers infrastructure to run, tune, and scale generative AI applications.\n\nYou can check out the rest of the team here.\n\nOur Thoughts\nOverall, we’re pretty excited about Hyperbolic. They are definitely one of the top teams to watch in Crypto AI.\nHyperbolic is more than just a compute provider. Innovations like PoSP and SpML add a new layer of trust and verification to decentralized AI.\nExperimenting with base models on Hyperbolic is quite fun, especially since they’re one of the few providers making this accessible today. We can definitely support their commitment to open-source AI.\nWe wrote about Prime Intellect a few weeks ago. It remains to be seen whether Hyperbolic is as focused on distributed AI training as Prime Intellect.\nWhile we’ve noted that the demand side of compute has generally been sparse, that doesn’t seem to be the case for Hyperbolic. They’ve shown early traction with the research market, attracting significant interest from researchers and developers.\nWhat a week for @hyperbolic_labs!\n> Still shocked by how we increased DAU and WAU by 1000+% over the past 2 weeks. Excited to see a lot of AI researchers and developers calling our API and spreading good words.\n> We hosted Llama 3.1 405B unquantized model on the same day of its… x.com/i/web/status/1… — Jasper Zhang 张钺🤘🌪️ (@zjasper666) 7:00 PM • Aug 3, 2024\n\n‍\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan & Joshua\n\n‍\n\nThis newsletter is intended solely for educational purposes and does not constitute financial advice.

    "full_content": "🐰 Sahara AI Raises a Whopping $43M\n\nSahara has been quiet for months, but just announced a massive $43M funding raise this week.\n\nThat’s a serious chunk of change, making it one of the largest funding rounds in the Crypto AI space. And a strong signal of investor interest.\n\nThey’ve secured some top-tier backers—Pantera, Polychain, and Sequoia are all in. But what really caught our eye were the advisors, including the co-founder of Nous Research and a founding member of Midjourney.\n\nWe’ve got a soft spot for teams with big ambitions, so we did what we do best: dug into everything we could find on Sahara and distilled it into a quick, 5-minute read.\n\nTheir CEO, Sean Ren, appeared on Show Me the Crypto (episode 134). We sat through the full hour, so you don’t have to.\n\nThe Collaborative AI Economy\n\nSahara AI is building the AI infrastructure layer to turn decentralized AI into a reality.\n\nTheir plan? Ambitious, to say the least. They’re working on:\n\nAn AI-native blockchain\nUser-friendly development tools\nSecure data storage and more\n\nUsers contribute their personal data to build domain-specific knowledge bases, developers use that data to train and deploy AI agents, infrastructure providers host Sahara nodes, and businesses get tailored AI solutions.\n\nBut let’s be real—you don’t realize a big vision by trying to do everything everywhere all at once.\n\nYou start with a sharp product wedge and grow from there.\n\nSahara’s 1st Product: The AI Marketplace\n\nSahara’s initial product is the AI Marketplace, and it’s a key pillar in their go-to-market strategy.\n\nDuring discussions with their seed investors, it became clear that this marketplace is a preview of how they plan to achieve their ultimate vision. It’s their first step, even before the launch of the Sahara Chain testnet.\n\nSource: Sahara\n\n‍\n\nAt the marketplace, users can complete tasks that help train AI. These tasks range from solving math problems to summarizing videos—essentially, it’s all about data labelling and annotation.\n\nThe submissions are then used to train AI models through reinforcement learning. In return, task completers are awarded points, potentially leading to tokens down the line (though that’s purely speculation for now).\n\nEnterprise clients like MIT, Microsoft, USC, and the Motherson Group are already tapping into this decentralized data marketplace to train their AI models. It’s set to open to the public soon.\n\nThe marketplace offers a robust suite of tools, including a data toolkit (for collection, labeling, QA, and more), a distribution engine, and a project management tool.\n\nWhy is Sahara doing this?\n\nSahara concluded that the current challenges for AI required a new level of data labelling and annotation.\n\nCEO Sean Ren explains:\n\n“We tried to build our network to allow 200,000 data labellers to work on these enterprise-level tasks. These data labellers come from all over the world, mostly from Africa and APAC and they have different expertise, language, and cultural backgrounds.\n\nSome of them had never worked on data labelling tasks before, but that’s the exact challenge. How can you make a product that looks very user-friendly, onboard first-time data labellers, and produce quality data for big enterprise clients like Microsoft, Amazon, Snapchat, etc.?”\n\nYour Knowledge, Your AI\n\nOne of the big issues in AI right now is copyright. Earlier this year, several U.S. newspapers filed a lawsuit against OpenAI for copyright infringement—and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nWhen OpenAI trained ChatGPT, it didn’t acknowledge the contributions from Reddit, Wikipedia, and GitHub users—the massive data troves it used to train its model.\n\nSahara sees this as a fundamental flaw. They recognize that these user contributions are incredibly valuable, and it’s only fair that users benefit from them. Sound familiar? We’ve touched on this before when we wrote about Vana, the Robinhood of user data.\n\nSahara believes that if you contribute value to the AI process—whether through the knowledge you share in the AI marketplace or by uploading your personal data for your own AI agent—you should own it.\n\nThis is where “Provenance” comes in.\n\nIn Sahara’s context, Provenance means adding a user watermark to your data. Messages, emails, content—everything will carry your unique watermark. That way, anyone developing AI applications or training models with your data must pay you for it. Provenance also extends to the models and applications. \n\nThis way, Sahara ensures that the original contributors are recognized and compensated accordingly.\n\n🌈 Research-Level Alpha\n\nSahara is still in its early stages, but the momentum is building. Back in May, they opened signups for their testnet and attracted 25,000 applicants.\n\nThe Sahara mainnet is set to launch sometime in Q4 of 2024. In the meantime, you can join their waitlist here.\n\nThe Team\n\nCEO and cofounder Sean Ren has an extensive background in AI. He’s an associate professor at USC, specializing in natural language processing and AI, and has won multiple awards for research and innovation in AI.\n\nCOO and cofounder Tyler Zhou was the investment director at Binance Labs before founding Sahara.\n\nYou can explore the rest of the team’s backgrounds here.\n\nOur Thoughts\nSahara has an ambitious roadmap lined up for the rest of the year, including the delivery of their mainnet. If they can pull this off, it will be a strong testament to the team’s capabilities.\nWe’ll be honest — there’s not enough public information yet to evaluate Sahara in depth (though a Litepaper is on the way). Much of what we’re hearing sounds promising and aspirational, but the real test will be in their ability to deliver.\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan & Joshua\n\n‍\n\nThis research is intended solely for educational purposes and does not constitute financial advice.

    "section": "Protocol Research",
    "full_content": "Vana is on a mission to revolutionise data ownership for training AI models.\n\nVana wants to:\n\nLiberate data from walled gardens\nShift ownership of AI back to the user\n\nIt’s the Robin Hood of data, giving ownership back to the people.\n\nUser Data is Immensely Valuable.\n\nUser data is used to personalize products, provide targeted marketing, and keep an edge over competitors.\n\nWith the rise of AI and model training, the value of user data has multiplied manyfold.\n\nUnfortunately, big tech companies monopolize and keep this private data for themselves. Companies like Reddit and Twitter have closed off access to their developer APIs to stop others from training on their data.\n\nThankfully, data privacy laws retain users’ right to their data. Vana leverages this.\n\nIf enough users willingly export their data and make it publicly available, could this create the largest, most comprehensive data treasury in the world?\n\nSource: Vana\n\n‍\n\nUsers collectively hold ~100 times the data used to train GPT-4. Imagine the capabilities of the models that are trained on this data.\n\nThis vast reservoir of high-quality data—like messaging from Instagram and Reddit—could significantly enhance AI model performance.\n\nVana’s Secret Sauce — the Data DAO\n\nWhy would users willingly contribute their data?\n\nThe answer lies in our favourite word in crypto: incentives!\n\nBig tech generates billions in revenue from harnassing user data. Imagine if users could own a share of the profits their data helped to create. Vana solves this through a concept called Data DAOs.\n\nSource: Vana\n\n‍\n\nThe Data DAO allows users to pool and govern their data, rewarding them with a token representing ownership of the particular dataset.\n\nThe DAO decides what to do with the data, such as renting it out for training purposes or selling copies of the data.\n\nSome of the Data DAOs on Vana’s testnet include:\n\nFinquarium (Financial)\nFlirtual (Dating)\nVolara (Twitter)\nReddit DAO, the largest with over 140K users\nWhat Role does Crypto Play?\n\nThe Vana network is an EVM-compatible L1 that optimizes for data transactions.\n\nSource: Vana\n\n‍\n\nUsers first upload their data to the relevant Digital Liquidity Pool (DLP), almost like a subnet.\n\nUpon upload, the user’s data is encrypted, and this transaction is recorded on Vana. The encrypted data then needs to be verified by the validators to ensure their quality and integrity.\n\nThis is done through Proof-of-Contribution, a valuation metric specific to each dataset. For example, the Reddit DAO uses karma as a contribution metric. Once the data is validated, another transaction is recorded on Vana, and the data is added to the DLP.\n\nPeople looking to train models can then purchase access to the DLP APIs or the data can be sold to data buyers at the discretion of the DAO. Users can see their data contributions through their own EVM wallet.\n\nThe VANA token will be used to pay transaction fees and govern the network:\n\n70% of block rewards to the top 16 DLPs based on metrics like transactions facilitated and verified data\n30% of block rewards to Propagators (Validators on the root network)\n🌈 Research-Level Alpha\n\nVana launched its Satori testnet on June 11. You can earn rewards by participating in the testnet in several ways. It’s early days, so active participants are not many at this time.\n\nCreate a DLP — the pool of data to which users can contribute data. This is competitive, and only 16 DLPs slots are available\nRun a Validator—Validate the quality of data contributions. It takes about 2 hours to set up, and you can run validators for multiple DLPs. You can register here.\nSubmit Test Data—contribute data to a DLP. I connected my Twitter account to this, and it took less than two minutes.\nThe Team\n\nFounder Anna Kazlauskas was previously a core engineer at Celo blockchain before founding Vana. She graduated from MIT with degrees in both computer science and economics.\n\nArthur Abal (COO) and Colin Stevenson (Head of Data) were both previously at Appen, a company specializing in high-quality, human-annotated data for machine learning and AI.\n\nMatthias Knauth (Head of Product) was Head of Product at both Credmark and First Coin GmbH.\n\nThe team has raised $20M in funding from Paradigm and other notable investors.\n\nAt the Imagination in Action summit, Anna Kazlauskas highlighted:\n\n“Yeah, so in summary, I think foundation models, they really tend towards monopolies. They require these huge upfront investments in the form of research, data, and compute.\n\nAnd it's very tempting, I think, for the open source AI community, or more broadly, anyone who's not big tech, to just sort of settle and say like, okay, we're going to do the best we can with the last generation of models that big tech companies open source to us and give us access to.\n\nBut we really don't need to settle for being a few generations behind, right?

    "section": "Protocol Research",
    "full_content": "Source: Spacenews.com / SpaceX webcast\n\n‍\n\nEarlier this month, SpaceX successfully launched Starship flight 4.\n\nIt’s the most powerful rocket ever flown.\n\nThis engineering marvel boasts a Super Heavy booster, which houses 33 Raptor engines, generating a total thrust of 72 MN. To put that in perspective, that’s twice the thrust of the Apollo mission rocket and three times that of a NASA space shuttle.\n\nI’m always captivated by the evolution of deep tech companies. Years of relentless effort and millions in R&D culminate in what appears to be an overnight success.\n\nBut insiders know that numerous low-probability events must align perfectly for a deep tech company to succeed. SpaceX, founded 22 years ago as a scrappy startup with big dreams, exemplifies this journey—an outcome of compounded hard work and iterative progress.\n\nSuch monumental success is rare in crypto.\n\nOnly a handful of crypto companies from the 2017-2018 wave during the ICO boom remain relevant today. We’re a young, nascent industry with very short attention spans, and this mindset often bleeds into how founders think about their companies.\n\nThat’s why it’s heartening to see an OG project elevate to the next level, becoming one of the most exciting launches of the year.\n\nArweave & AO Computer — Closely Intertwined\n\nIt took 5+ years for Arweave to cross the 10M transaction mark (16 Nov 2023). Source: https://viewblock.io/arweave/stat/tx\n\nLaunched in 2018, Arweave is decentralized permanent data storage. Despite the fundamental importance of data storage, it has struggled to find a compelling use case and adoption.\n\nData storage isn’t exactly sexy. It’s a commodity.\n\nAO computer is Arweave’s most ambitious project.\n\nAR = storage layer.\n\nAO = compute layer\n\nAO aims to be a scalable, secure, trustless and customizable computing platform—a hyper-parallel computer.\n\nThe big idea is that deterministic virtual machines + permanent data storage = reproducible state. Envisioned four years ago, this has materialized into AO’s actor-oriented computing environment.\n\nI want to emphasize that AO computer vastly differs from most other blockchains today. Its existence is enabled due to the foundational work done by Sam (founder) and the Arweave team over the years. Like deep tech startups need a solid groundwork to succeed, AO wouldn’t be possible without Arweave’s secure decentralized storage network.\n\nAnd I’m rooting for them to succeed.\n\nNot Another Ethereum or Solana\n\nEthereum and Solana are global synchronous state machines with a shared global state.\n\nAO computer is a shared global messaging machine with localized states\n\nShared global state is the default mode for blockchains today. It enables consensus and trust among participants, maintaining the integrity of the ledger. However, this falls short of supporting AI applications of the future.\n\nThe AO computer framework differentiates itself from Ethereum and Solana through two primary features:\n\n(1) scalable compute capabilities and\n\n(2) a flexible security model.\n\nScaling Compute\n\nIn Ethereum and Solana, adding more compute resources (new nodes) does not enhance the network’s output. Ethereum still processes 12 - 15 transactions per second, no matter how many validator nodes there are.\n\nHowever, the AO computer framework offers a dynamic approach to scaling. The computational output scales correspondingly as additional compute resources are integrated into the network. This is because AO processes run in parallel locally, unhindered by the limitations of a global state.\n\nSecurity\n\nEthereum employs a uniform security model where every transaction is protected equally within its Proof of Stake (PoS) network. While this ensures consistency, it can be inefficient and expensive for low-value transactions, such as gaming.\n\nThe AO computer framework introduces a flexible security model, allowing developers to tailor security requirements to the specific needs of their processes.\n\nA F**King Big Computer\n\nImagine you have a giant supercomputer made up of many smaller computers spread all over the world.\n\nThis big, connected computer can do lots of things at once, like running games and apps. The smaller computers talk to each other using a messaging system. The best part is that each small computer isn’t slowed down by the rest of the network but still gets the security and trust of a blockchain.\n\nThis is what the AO computer is, in a nutshell.\n\nThe AO computer framework modifies typical blockchain node architecture by decomposing it into smaller, modular components. These components include:\n\nProcesses\nMessaging Units\nScheduler Units\nCompute Units\n\nEach element plays a critical role in the system’s overall functionality (the docs and whitepaper provide full details).\n\nSource: Messari\n\n‍\n\nAt a high level, AO can be distilled down to three core concepts:\n\nMultiple processes that can run in parallel.\nProcesses maintain individual sovereignty.\nAsynchronous messaging that allows for coordination & communication between processes\n\nParallel Processing\n\nAt the heart of the AO framework are processes, which are applications on the platform. These processes run independently and in parallel. Individual processes have no visibility into the local state of other processes.\n\nThis isolation allows for complex computations on powerful machines, expanding the design space far beyond the limitations imposed by conventional smart contract protocols (fees, gas limits, block sizes).\n\nCompute Units play a critical role here. They provide the necessary computing power to keep AO processes running efficiently.\n\nApplication Sovereignty\n\nA distinguishing feature of AO is the sovereignty it grants to developers.\n\nEach process operates autonomously, allowing developers to select their computational tasks, virtual machines, and security parameters without interference from other processes.\n\nDevelopers can adjust security measures based on the value and sensitivity of specific transactions or computations.\n\nAsynchronous Messaging\n\nThis is the glue that holds the network together. Communication within the AO protocol is managed through asynchronous messaging.\n\nProcesses exchange messages to coordinate actions and receive the necessary data. All applications adhere to a universal messaging standard, ensuring consistency and interoperability.\n\nMessaging Units relay these messages, working in concert with Scheduler Units—akin to rollup sequencers—which order messages and record them on Arweave.\n\nAO’s Trillion-Dollar Opportunity is in AI\n\nRunning a large, multi-billion parameter AI model like LLama-3 directly on Ethereum is impossible.\n\nComputational Requirements, Data Storage & Bandwidth: LLaMA-3 models need significant computational resources (RAM, GPU power). Ethereum is not optimized for the large-scale data storage and high bandwidth necessary for LLM inferences.\nLatency and Performance: Ethereum’s transaction speed hinders the low-latency, high-throughput environment required for effectively using AI models. No user wants to wait 12 seconds (Ethereum’s block time) for a result.\nCosts: AI inference on-chain is very expensive. Period.\nFlagship open source LLMs.\n100% onchain.\nAI on AO is here.\n— ao (@aoTheComputer)\n4:04 PM • Jun 20, 2024\n\nSo, I was very excited when AO announced last week that large language models (LLMs) could run on smart contracts, bringing intelligence directly into the blockchain. This would integrate human-like decision-making within a trustless network.\n\nMemory\n\nRunning an AI model requires loading the model parameters into the memory. The more parameters there are, the larger the memory requirements.\n\nRunning a relatively smaller model like LLama-3-8B will require at least 12GB of RAM. GPT-4 has 1.76 trillion+ parameters. GPT-5 is expected to have 50 trillion parameters (!!). AI models are only going to get larger.\n\nSource: AO Computer\n\n‍\n\nBlockchains today are very limited, memory-wise. At a protocol level:\n\nEthereum has 48KB of RAM when executing smart contracts\nSolana has 10MB of RAM\nEven Internet Computer (ICP), which is making a push into AI, has ~3B of RAM and has a limited capability for AI applications.\n\nAO uses WebAssembly in its execution environment and now supports WASM64, enabling high-performance applications. Today, AO has a 16GB memory limit, with a ceiling of 18 exabytes at the protocol level. This enables it to run heavy computations, such as inference on Llama-3 or Phi 3 (unquantized)\n\nData Storage\n\nWeaveDrive is a new feature that enables AO applications to access all of Arweave’s data like a local hard drive.\n\nBy functioning as a local file system within a smart contract, WeaveDrive enhances the efficiency and accessibility of data storage and retrieval. More dApps will be incentivised to upload and store data on Arweave.\n\nAO Computer’s framework enables the direct on-chain execution of large AI models by leveraging the full computational power of individual machines.\n\nBy combining an unbounded execution environment with efficient and accessible data storage, AO significantly expands the design space for on-chain applications, especially those that are compute-intensive and AI-driven. This facilitates the development of autonomous agents with smart contract-like guarantees.\n\nIntegrating cron jobs—a feature not natively available on most blockchains—and autonomous agents will significantly boost on-chain activity, fostering more sophisticated and dynamic interactions.\n\nMany people will underestimate how important this breakthrough is as we move towards an era of AI ubiquity.\n\nLlamaland serves as a proof-of-concept showcase: an AI-powered MMO game built on the AO computer.\n\nIn Llamaland, users can submit petitions to the Llama King, an AI agent that uses a large language model (LLM) to review their petitions and decide how much memecoin to allocate to each user. Remarkably, this entire process is executed fully on-chain, making it the first implementation of an LLM operating entirely on-chain.\n\nAlthough it is not live yet, you can register on the waitlist.\n\nBuilding the Permaweb\n\nOdysee is a video sharing platform\n\nOn 6 Jun, Arweave made 3 major announcements aimed at expanding its distribution:\n\nAcquisition of Odysee by Forward Research\nLaunch of AgentFi by Autonomous Finance\nAO ventures with $35M in funding for builders in AO ecosystem\n\nFrom my perspective, the most eye-catching one was the Odysee acquisition. It’s under-appreciated by most.\n\nOdysee is the largest Web3 social app that no one has heard of.\n\nSource: Similarweb\n\n‍\n\nIt has 7M+ monthly active users (20x MAU of Farcaster) and 2.2M website visits each month. Odysee operates as a more open version of YouTube, leveraging blockchain technology to give creators greater control and freedom. Unlike YouTube, which relies on traditional ad revenue sharing, Odysee rewards creators with LBRY Credits (LBC).\n\nOdysee is like if YouTube was more like Reddit, a darker corner of the internet where freedom of speech is emphasized and content is less filtered. Its “Wild West” category is particularly notable for hosting more controversial and unfiltered content.\n\nAccording to SimilarWeb, a significant portion of its audience comes from Europe, especially France, Spain, and Germany. While it will not rival YouTube in size, Odysee still attracts a substantial user base, which could be potential users for AO apps.\n\nOdysee will now be building on Arweave infrastructure, adding its platform to the permaweb and giving creators total control over their content.\n\nApps on AO\nSource: ao.link, data as of 19 June 2024\n\n‍\n\nAO is currently operating on its testnet, utilizing a Proof of Authority (PoA) security mechanism. Most applications on the mainnet will adopt a Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism. The mainnet launch date has yet to be determined.\n\nOver the past three months, the testnet has seen approximately 7,000 daily active users, with 3,000 to 4,000 processes and 182 million messages sent. While these numbers aren’t staggering, they indicate the presence of a small but active community.\n\nDexi\n\nDexi autonomously gathers and organizes data on asset prices, swaps, liquidity, and more. Think of Dexi as a blockchain-based Bloomberg. It is managed by a network of autonomous agents and hosted on Arweave, connected to all available liquidity pools.\n\nDexi is permissionless, pulling data directly from the Dexi aggregation agent. This setup ensures censorship resistance, with all information verifiable on-chain.\n\n0rbit\n\n0rbit is a decentralized oracle network with two main components: an AO module and a network of nodes that fetch data from anywhere on the internet. This is critical infrastructure for useful applications to be built on AO.\n\nThe AO module interacts with 0rbit nodes to send data requests and receive results. Anyone can run a node and contribute to the network. Data is fetched from the internet asynchronously, meaning the process does not have to wait for a response.\n\nFor example, 0rbit can fetch news from user-defined website APIs and price feeds from Coingecko’s API.\n\nDuring my tinkering, I found a few other interesting things on AO, including AMMs (Bark, Permaswap, ArSwap), Trunk (an AO meme coin), and Astro, an over-collateralised stablecoin using AR as collateral. It is still early for AO, with many projects yet to be tested in production or see significant transactions and volume.\n\nImportant Read: AO Tokenomics\n\nThe AO token went live on 14 June, with minting retrospectively dated from 27 February 2024. I like how it was launched fairly, with no investor or team allocations.\n\nThe minting schedule mirrors Bitcoin’s distribution model with no pre-mint and 21M total tokens. The rate of newly minted tokens decreases by half every 4 years, although this is smoothened rather than through a discrete halving event.\n\nNew AO tokens will be split between:\n\nArweave token holders (36%)\nBridgers of staked assets like stETH, SOL (64%)\n\nSo far, ~1M tokens have been minted, most of which have been retrospectively distributed to AR token holders. AR token holders will continue to earn AO tokens every 5 minutes. AOCRED tokens from the testnet can be converted to AO at a 1000:1 ratio.\n\nImportantly: AO tokens will not be transferable or tradable until 15% of the total supply has been minted (approximately 8 February 2025). This gives time for the fledging ecosystem to develop and for mainnet to launch, where AO tokens will be used to secure the network.\n\nMining AO by holding AR\n\nI did some calculations on the expected return for each AR token. Calculations here assume 1 AR = $30.\n\n1 AR token holder will receive ~0.016 AO tokens over the next 12 months.\nThere will be ~4.2M AO in circulation in 12 months time\n\nThe APYs for holding AR are modest, ranging from 2.5% - 50% depending on expected FDV, which in turn depends on market conditions when the token becomes tradable next year. Assuming market sentiment is good in 2025, a $10B FDV could be quite reasonable, implying an APY of 25%.\n\nMining AO by bridging assets e.g. stETH\n\nHolding 0.01% of the bridge Total Value Locked (TVL) for 12 months will accrue approximately 210 AO tokens.\n\nAs of June 25, there is ~$320 million of bridged stETH mining AO, leading to an exceptionally juicy APY of 33% - 600% depending on TVL & FDV. The estimated APY is volatile and heavily influenced by the total value of assets bridged (TVL) and expected token FDV.\n\nThis makes for a very attractive, low-risk yield opportunity for anyone holding stETH today.\n\nThe APY will decrease as more users become aware of this and bridge their stETH. The idea of bridging stETH to mine tokens is a win-win situation for both the AO team and its users.\n\nSubstantial revenue is generated from the bridged stETH (~$30M/year for $1B in deposits), which will fund ecosystem projects and other development activities.\n\nSource: Dune @zkayape\n\n‍Monitoring the TVL of bridged assets will be crucial, as it will likely form an equilibrium with the AR token price. If the TVL remains relatively low, more people may sell AR to farm using staked assets, and vice versa.\n\nThe parent token, AR, has a total supply of 66 million tokens, with 65 million in circulation. AR has potential disinflationary properties because AR spent on data storage goes into the endowment fund, which will release AR tokens only when mining becomes unprofitable.\n\nOne of the things I am happiest about with AR is that in the initial distribution anyone could take part. The tokens went directly to ~650 community members who believed in the mission.\n\nAO holders on day one of bridge minting: Every AR holder + 448 pre-bridgers. Dashboard 👇\n\n— 🐘🔗 sam.arweave.dev (@samecwilliams)\n11:15 PM • Jun 17, 2024\nHow I’m Thinking about AO\n\nWhen considering whether a protocol will succeed, I like to break it down into smaller bets.\n\nI ask myself: What are the most important things that need to go right for AO to achieve Solana-like success?\n\nHigh demand for AI Agents and Applications in Crypto: Given the rapid advancements in AI over the past two years, this seems to be the current trajectory. Offchain computations using techniques like zkML/OpML are being developed on other blockchains, but only AO supports full AI computation directly on-chain today.\nComposability with Major Blockchains: AO must integrate closely with other major blockchains. Expecting existing developers and applications to migrate entirely to AO is unrealistic. Therefore, building bridges and communication pipelines with existing ecosystems will be crucial.\nDeveloping the Social Layer: Ultimately, the success of a blockchain is not about transaction speed or low fees. Cultivating a passionate developer community and engaging users is key to widespread adoption. Monitoring developer activity and social media sentiment can serve as proxy metrics.\n\nI will be watching these three aspects very closely and adjusting my level of conviction accordingly.\n\nOther thoughts\nAO computer approaches decentralised computing in a way that is quite different from traditional blockchains. It could be a hit or miss. But the ability to perform large computations on-chain is a major unlock in the age of AI\nAO uses an actor-oriented approach. Such platforms are used in systems that require high concurrency, modularity, and scalability. While the actor model offers theoretical advantages, its widespread adoption and success at a large scale is still yet to be proven. Challenges include handling unexpected failures and maintaining consistency across distributed actors.\nAO is extremely nascent. While tinkering on testnet, I found users mostly experimenting with text-based chats and games. Tooling needs to be built out, which takes time. Due to the different architecture and language used, it’s not easy to port apps directly from other chains. Overall, AO feels like Solana in its early 2021 days, when it had only a few applications and a lot of scepticism.\nLong-term conviction necessary: AO requires a high level of conviction. Short-term traders may struggle to find immediate catalysts since the token will only be tradable in 2025.\nDemand for Arweave: AO will create consistent demand for AR, acting as both a growth catalyst and a new platform for app development. Every process on AO will be writing data on Arweave and driving utility for AR.\n\nAI and crypto are undoubtedly the two most significant technology paradigm shifts of this decade. The intersection of AI and crypto will be transformative. In the future, we will likely look back and wonder why we didn’t pay more attention to this.\n\nMy gut tells me that AO will be a key player leading the charge forward.\n\n‍\n\nBest regards,\n\nTeng Yan\n\n‍\n\nThis newsletter is intended solely for educational purposes and does not constitute financial advice.

    "full_content": "A search for decentralised collective intelligence led me to Bittensor. Would the Bittensor model be able to bootstrap AI networks in specific domains?\n\nMy findings were startling and made me pause.\n\nBittensor has several critical flaws.\n\nA Quick Recap\nSource: Bittensor.com\n\n‍\n\nBittensor operates as a decentralised incentive network for AI models.\n\nAcross its 32 subnets, miners deploy their AI models to compete based on specific criteria. Validators then assess and rank these outputs, and miners earn TAO tokens based on their relative performance. Currently, these subnets are handling tasks such as text generation, image generation, text-to-speech, and model fine-tuning.\n\n“Horse Racing for AI models”: Image generated with DALL-E 2\n\nTL;dr — it’s horse racing for AI models. The best horse (model) gets the greatest rewards.\n\nThe big idea is that monetary incentives will naturally attract the top-performing models and innovators to the most relevant subnets.\n\nI first shared some of my early views on Bittensor in November last year. Since then, Bittensor has grown to become the darling of Crypto Twitter, the flagbearer for the decentralised AI movement. As of today, Bittensor's market capitalization is at $2.8 billion, with a fully diluted valuation of $8.5 billion.\n\nA Rocky Road Ahead\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest issues with Bittensor are:\n\n1. Horizontal economics are broken\n\nIncentive-driven competition within subnets to produce the best outputs can make sense — IF implemented properly.\n\nNotice the bold, capitalised “IF”.\n\nChallenges such as the gaming of incentives, relay mining, and assumptions about validators' knowledge of truly correct outputs exist. I believe these problems can be solved with enough research and experimentation. Several subnets have already taken steps or revised their criteria to discourage relay mining and other exploitative practices.\n\nHowever, the economic model starts to fall apart when competition extends horizontally.\n\nSubnets have to compete with one another to get a larger allocation of inflation rewards. This will become even more pronounced once dynamic TAO is implemented (where subnets will have their own dynamic tokens and token holders can affect the distribution of rewards between subnets)\n\nThis begs the question:\n\nHow should a TAO holder compare the economic value to the Bittensor network between very different subnets? For example:\n\n(1) a text-to-speech model (subnet 3)\n\nvs\n\n(2) a vision model that screens X-rays for disease? \n\nValue generation in each case is entirely different. You can spin this question in many ways, but the answer is never clear-cut. Relying on market forces to determine each subnet's value contribution is not optimal for long-term strategic development.\n\nIt’s like having every AAPL shareholder vote on the next product Apple should build.\n\n2. Competitive Challenges for Subnets\n\nI’m sceptical that Bittensor subnets can be competitive in bread-and-butter generative AI tasks, such as general image and text generation. Already there are open-source projects, often motivated by reputation, research contributions, and public service, that excel in these areas.\n\nTake, for example, Meta's release of its powerful large language model (LLM), Llama-3, as an open-source tool. Despite the billions of dollars invested in its development, Llama-3 is freely accessible and has garnered significant community support. Since its release last week, it has been downloaded over 500,000+ times on Huggingface.\n\nComparative benchmarks show that open-source LLMs like Llama-3 are already state-of-the-art, and arguably on par with proprietary models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4.\n\nTo date, I have not seen Bittensor subnets achieving outcomes or capabilities that exceed those of existing open-source models. Neither have I seen evidence suggesting they outperform established benchmarks. At some point, you have to ask yourself if they ever will.\n\n3. High costs of running the intelligence network\n\nThe network relies heavily on its native token, TAO, to function. Miners join the network primarily when they identify a computing arbitrage opportunity—specifically when the mining rewards exceed the computation costs.\n\nThe demand side for TAO is contingent on the following: \n\n(1) Speculators (a large can of worms we won’t get into here)\n\n(2) Addition of more Bittensor subnets, or increased demand to become miners or validators. However, this growth tends to dilute the incentives for existing participants. A drop in token price leads to a reflexive drop in network activity as the unit economics for miners/validators fall under pressure.\n\nSource: Taostats.io\n\n‍\n\nBittensor has substantial operational costs, with a daily inflation of 7,200 TAO paid to subnet owners + miners + validators. This equates to ~$3.2 million per day or $1.2 billion annually.\n\nThis raises a critical question: Where does this funding come from? Predominantly, it's speculators. But is Bittensor producing $1.2B in value in a year? Its valuation has probably gotten too far ahead of itself.\n\n4. Transparency\n\nAlthough Bittensor offers some level of decentralization, it is important to note that it is NOT open source—a crucial distinction. While participation in a subnet is open to anyone, the internal mechanics are not transparent, leaving users with a limited understanding of the activities within:\n\nWhat are the miners doing?\nWhat algorithms are they running?\nHow are the final results generated?\n\nThis lack of transparency can restrict the variety of applications that can be developed using subnet outputs, as many developers require a clear understanding of the underlying inference processes.\n\nSome Reflections\n\nI’m not anti-Bittensor. In fact, I find it one of the most intriguing experiments in the emerging Crypto x AI sector.\n\nIt has successfully rallied a community of smart people around its vision. It is likely to inspire numerous future projects. Yet, Bittensor must address its current challenges head-on to stand any chance of achieving real-world success — otherwise it will be lost in the graveyard of speculative hype.\n\nA few closing thoughts:\n\nGreater synergy could be achieved if all subnets within the network were aligned toward specific sectors rather than dispersed across a variety of unrelated tasks.\nFor instance, I envision a \"Bittensor for genomic research/drug discovery\" or a \"Bittensor for finance/trading.\" that can actually do very well. Such vision alignment fosters economic cohesion, strategic direction, and business development efforts.\nBittensor's economic model — in its current state — may best serve niche areas of AI that do not attract widespread attention but could benefit from targeted incentives. Potential applications include crypto-specific tasks, such as predicting token prices.\n\nFinally, I firmly believe that decentralisation in AI has an extremely important role in the world — acting as a counterbalance to Big Tech's global dominance and fostering innovation, particularly through open-source initiatives.\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan",

    "full_content": "TL;DR\nBagel is tackling one of open-source AI’s biggest challenges: monetization.\nBy combining advanced cryptography with privacy-preserving machine learning, Bagel enables open-source AI model contributors to generate value without sacrificing transparency.\nZKLoRA is a breakthrough that allows developers to share and protect their fine-tuned AI adapters using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). It ensures fair attribution and monetization while keeping proprietary details private.\nBecause ZKLoRA makes verification fast and cheap, it democratizes access to fine-tuned AI. Even on massive models like Llama-70B with 80 LoRA modules, verification remains practical and efficient (< 2 minutes).\n\nLet’s start with a thought experiment.\n\nYou’ve built an extraordinary open-source AI model capable of interpreting MRI scans more accurately than any radiologist. It’s a groundbreaking tool that could diagnose cancer early and save thousands of lives.\n\nBut there’s a catch—the journey to get there was grueling. Months of your life are spent battling internal departments for data access. Countless late nights painstakingly labeling MRI images after a full day of work. Tens of thousands of dollars sunk into GPUs, possible only from hard-fought grant funding.\n\nIt’s exhausting, but you tell yourself it’s worth it. This model will change the game. It will save lives. It’s a pain I know all too well, having spent half my career in healthcare.\n\nBut then, one morning, you wake up to your worst nightmare. Your open-source masterpiece, which you poured blood, sweat, and grants into, has been cloned. Some developer, who probably didn’t spend a second labeling data, is now selling it as a premium product. And you? You don’t even get a thank-you note.\n\nOpen Source Is Broken\n\nUnfortunately, this is the everyday story of open-source AI. The reality for many creators.\n\nOpen-source AI has democratized innovation, putting powerful models into the hands of anyone with a laptop and an internet connection. Collaboration, open datasets, and transparent codebases have fuelled breakthroughs that would’ve been impossible in a world dominated by proprietary systems.\n\nBut there’s a glaring issue: the people powering this ecosystem—developers, researchers, and data contributors—rarely see any recognition or compensation. Monetization feels like an afterthought, left to corporations that build profitable layers on top.\n\nAnd without good monetization models, you can only rely on the goodwill of others to make progress. What happens if Zuck stops making the next generation of Llama models open source? What if there was no DeepSeek?\n\nLet's be honest — we’re screwed.\n\nSo, what do we do about it?\n\nHow do we keep open-source AI vibrant, fair, and sustainable?\n\nThis is the story of Bagel.\n\nBagel is taking on one of open-source AI’s biggest challenges: monetization. By combining advanced cryptography with privacy-preserving machine learning, it’s building a platform where open AI models can generate value without sacrificing transparency. If it works, it could reshape the economics of open-source innovation.\n\nOur deep dive unpacks Bagel’s vision. Part one explores its origins and cryptographic breakthroughs with ZKLoRA. Part two breaks down the “Bakery” protocol, its actual traction thus far, and how it tackles the monetization gap practically.\n\nIf Bagel succeeds, it could be the lifeline open-source AI desperately needs. Let’s dive in.\n\nInnovation vs Exploitation\n\nOpen-source AI thrives on transparency and collaboration.\n\nIt’s a system where anyone can inspect, refine, and build on existing models, fostering collective innovation. But openness comes with a cost—exploitation.\n\nThe moment a model is public, it’s a free game. Cloning, rebranding, and profit-taking without attribution run rampant leaving original creators without recognition or reward.\n\nThe Open Source Initiative (OSI) is working to define open-source AI formally, ensuring access to data, source code, and model parameters. But a definition alone won’t solve the biggest issue: sustainability. Developers have tried everything—donations, premium versions, SaaS—but none have cracked the problem of fair attribution and funding.\n\nI’m heartened that there are still success cases.\n\nLet’s go back to healthcare as an example.\n\nAI has incredible potential to revolutionize medicine, yet progress has been frustratingly slow. Why? Because so much of the field is stuck in closed-loop systems. Hospitals, researchers, and corporations hoard their data, and even open-source projects face the uphill battle of scaling without a sustainable model..\n\nSource: NVIDIA\n\n‍\n\nOne notable exception is MONAI.\n\nLaunched in 2019 by NVIDIA, NIH, and King’s College London, it’s an open-source deep-learning framework tailored for medical imaging. With powerful tools like MAISI, a 3D diffusion model that generates synthetic medical images, MONAI has revolutionized AI research without relying on sensitive patient data.\n\nBut MONAI’s success exposes a hard truth: even the best open-source projects need deep-pocketed backers. NVIDIA funds MONAI’s growth through enterprise licensing, hardware sales, and platform integrations. Without this, even a groundbreaking project like MONAI could struggle to survive.\n\nSo here’s the real question: How do we create more MONAIs—AI projects that remain open while sustaining themselves independently?\n\nIf open-source AI is to reach its full potential, we need a model that protects creators, ensures attribution, and makes transparency profitable, not just idealistic.\n\nClosed AI Is Raking in the Cash\n\nMeanwhile, the AI landscape is dominated by closed-source giants like Anthropic, OpenAI, and now the $500 billion Stargate project, which centralizes power and resources in ways that could stifle grassroots innovation.\n\nAnd they’re raking in the revenue.\n\nIn 2024, OpenAI’s API alone is generating an estimated $500M - $800M each year, with top-line revenue growing at a whopping 248% annually. The profit margins on its API are estimated to be at least 50%, with the most expensive o1 model likely boasting margins of 70 - 80%.\n\nIf you minus the spending on training AI and just focus on the inference, they’ve mastered the art of turning AI into a lucrative business—while open-source developers scrape together resources for their next GPU.\n\nFor many, this imbalance feels both unfair and inevitable. Open source was never designed to make its creators rich. Just look at Linux. It runs 60% of the world’s servers, yet Linus Torvalds never cashed in billions from selling it.\n\nThe Lightbulb Moment\n\nBagel’s founder, Bidhan Roy, saw the problem up close. Managing machine learning infrastructure for Amazon Alexa, where 100M+ devices ran on his systems, he knew open AI (pun intended) could scale.\n\nThe problem wasn’t capability—it was funding. Without deep pockets for training, open models were either ignored or stolen by those who could afford to deploy them better.\n\nIn 2017, while working on Bitcoin trading at Cash App, Bidhan had a realization: cryptography could fix this. What if open-source AI had built-in mechanisms to recognize and reward contributors automatically?\n\nThe idea was bold but doable—a system where anyone sharing data, compute, or model training could get compensated fairly and transparently.\n\nThat’s how Bagel was born.\n\nBagel: Attribution + Privacy + Ownership\n\n“If I had to sum it up,” says Bidhan, “we’re making open-source AI monetisable using cryptography.”\n\nIn practice, that means three pillars:\n\nAttribution: Every contributor to improving the model—whether adding code or data—gets credited. When revenue flows, cryptographic protocols ensure fair, automatic distribution.\n\nSimple, right? Not quite. Attribution is messy.\n\nWhere does value actually accrue? How do you measure a dataset’s impact on model performance? One promising approach focuses on benchmark improvements—if a model gets better on these benchmarks after new data is added, that contributor deserves a cut.\n\nPrivacy: Bagel’s ecosystem supports privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML), so you can share your data or model parameters without actually revealing them.\n\nOwnership: Instead of conventional licensing agreements, contributors maintain perpetual ownership of their innovations. How? Through privacy-preserving containers and parameter obfuscation. Your work stays yours, locked up in a digital vault, ensuring you always have a stake in what you help build.\n\n\nThe result is the trifecta for open-source AI: preserve privacy, ensure fair attribution, and retain ownership—while getting paid.\n\nFor open-source AI developers, it’s like finally getting compensated for picking the low-hanging fruit they’ve been growing all along.\n\nZK that actually works\n\nBagel’s latest research on zero-knowledge Low-Rank Adaptation (ZKLoRA) marks a breakthrough in collaboration, monetization, and trust in open-source AI. They have also open-sourced the code for all to use. (go Bagel!)\n\nWith ZKLoRA, developers no longer have to choose between sharing and protecting their work. They can have both.\n\nThere’s a lot to unpack, so we’ll break it down step by step so you get a clear understanding by the end of this essay.\n\nWhy Fine-Tuning Matters\n\nLet’s start with a quick primer on fine-tuning AI models.\n\nIn the AI world, the focus is shifting from pre-training (where only a handful of companies can truly compete), to post-training and fine-tuning, where the productivity gains are just beginning\n\nConsider an open-source base model like Llama-3. It’s powerful and great for broad tasks, but not particularly useful when you need it to do something highly specific, like legal document analysis or medical diagnosis.\n\nSo we need to fine-tune these models: take the base model, feed it proprietary data, and create a tailored version for your use case.\n\nSource: https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/practical-tips-for-finetuning-llms\n\n‍\n\nLoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a lightweight, parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. Which means only the required parts of a large model are fine-tuned while keeping the base model frozen.\n\nInstead of retraining the entire model, LoRA trains a compact adapter module that layers on top of the frozen base model. These adapters are highly tuned towards a specific task. It’s fast, cheap, and efficient.\n\nThis architecture works like Lego—millions of developers can stack, mix, and build on each other’s modular contributions.\n\nCompared to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—which constantly queries a database (adding latency) or stuff data into a context window (driving up token costs)—LoRA is a one-time investment. Once fine-tuned, the model can run indefinitely without extra compute costs, making it a scalable, cost-efficient alternative.\n\nEnter ZKLoRA\n\nLoRA is a great way to fine-tune AI models, but it comes with a major dilemma—if you share your adapter openly, how do you stop others from copying it? And if you sell it, how does the buyer know it even works?\n\nWith ZKLoRA, Bagel solves both problems by integrating zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). ZKPs are like showing someone the answer to a puzzle without revealing how you solved it.\n\nIn LoRA’s case, ZKLoRA lets developers prove their fine-tuned adapter works with a base model—without ever exposing proprietary details. \n\nHere’s what that means in practice:\n\n• For developers: You can monetize your fine-tuned adapters without fear of being copied. Your secret sauce stays secret. The source code does not have to be open for the system to function well.\n\n• For buyers: You get proof that the adapter does what it claims without taking the seller’s word for it. No guesswork, no blind trust.\n\nThe magic of ZKLoRA lies in its streamlined, three-step workflow:\n\nMulti-Party Inference\n\nThe base model owner and the LoRA creator exchange encrypted activations—like swapping puzzle pieces without revealing the full picture.\n\nThe base model processes part of the input locally, generating partial results (activations)\nThese activations are sent to the LoRA contributor, who uses their private LoRA weights to compute adjustments\n\nThis ensures that sensitive data—both the base model parameters and LoRA weights—remain private throughout the interaction.\n\nProof Generation:\n\nNow, the LoRA contributor has made adjustments, but the base model owner needs proof that these changes are valid—without revealing the actual LoRA model.\n\nTo solve this, the contributor generates cryptographic proofs, verifying that their transformations follow the LoRA methodology. These proofs confirm the adapter’s compatibility with the base model without ever exposing proprietary LoRA weights.\n\nIn short, the contributor is saying, “Trust me, this works,”—and the math proves it.\n\nFast Verification:\n\nFinally, the base model owner quickly verifies the proofs, taking only 1–2 seconds per module.\n\n• If any proof fails, the corresponding LoRA module is rejected.\n\n• If all proofs pass, the process continues seamlessly.\n\nThe speed of verification allows models to stack multiple LoRA modules without slowing down significantly.\n\nSo ZKLoRA is fast and scalable.\n\nEven on massive models like Llama-70B with 80 LoRA modules, verification remains practical and efficient (< 2 minutes).\n\nThis is a huge breakthrough, considering that zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have historically been slow and computationally expensive. ZKLoRA somehow makes zero-knowledge cryptography look… efficient.\n\nHow was Bagel able to solve this?\nDidn’t get time to follow up on what this means for decentralized AI, open-source etc.\nZKLoRA is a verification protocol for our new open-source model architecture. This architecture works like Lego - millions of developers can stack their modular contributions on top of each… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n‍— bidhan roy 🥯 (@bidhanxyz)\n4:46 PM • Feb 5, 2025\n\nEarly ZK approaches in machine learning focused on proving compute usage—a flawed metric. It checks that a set of mathematical operations was performed without bothering with the output quality.\n\nIn reality, in training, tons of compute goes to waste (overfitting, bad hyperparameters etc.) when results don’t meet evaluation standards. The real question is not compute usage, but whether a contribution actually improves the model.\n\nSecond, Bagel keeps it modular instead of verifying entire models with billions of parameters. By only verifying the LoRAs, it makes the process lightweight. Bagel focuses on optimizing verification to prove impact, not effort—with ultra-low latency.\n\nZKLoRA is a Big Deal\nJust tested @BagelOpenAI ZKLoRa's implementation - mind blown by how ZKML has evolved 🤯\n\nThe clean abstraction is impressive:\n• Full LoRA server + proof generation\n• Client inference\n• Proof verification\n\nAll in <100 lines.\nFeels like we're finally making ZKML accessible.\n\n— superoo7 (@jlwhoo7)\n2:02 PM • Feb 6, 2025\n\nWith this, we can imagine a marketplace for fine-tuned AI adapters—legal, medical, gaming, you name it. Developers can sell verified, plug-and-play modules without worrying about piracy. Buyers, in turn, get cryptographic proof that what they’re buying works. Everyone wins.\n\nOpen-source AI thrives on global collaboration, but working with anonymous or remote contributors has always been a risky endeavor. ZKLoRA eliminates the need for blind trust.\n\nYou don’t need to trust the person—you just need to trust the math. And math is never wrong.\n\nBecause ZKLoRA makes verification fast and cheap, it democratizes access to fine-tuned AI. Small developers with limited resources can now confidently participate in the ecosystem, creating a broader, more diverse range of fine-tuned solutions.\n\nBy protecting their work, we can create the right incentives for developers to build specialized adapters.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nBagel is rewriting the rules of open-source AI.\n\nBy fusing cryptography with privacy-preserving machine learning, it’s turning open-source into a sustainable, monetizable ecosystem—without killing its collaborative spirit. Creators can finally get paid.\n\nIf it works, open-source AI might finally have the business model to stand toe-to-toe with the closed-source giants. And that’s a future worth betting on\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan\n\nIn Part two, we’ll break down the “Bakery” protocol, Bagel’s open source AI marketplace, and how it addresses ther monetization gap.

A half-page spread features a digital “worker” hired as a project manager—so commonplace now it barely raises an eyebrow.\n\nMany months ago, I’d have laughed at the thought, maybe even wagered my portfolio that such advancements were at least 5 years out. But that’s the breakneck pace at which Crypto AI will flip the world. I truly believe this.\n\nAs I settled back at my desk to kick off the new year (after recovering from a bad stomach bug, which I do not recommend), I wanted to start with something valuable—that sparks curiosity and maybe even a little debate. And what’s more priceless than trying to peer into the future?\n\nI don’t usually wade into predictions, but Crypto AI is just too good to resist. There’s no historical playbook, no trends to lean on—just a blank canvas for imagining what’s next. And honestly, the thought of revisiting this in 2026 to see how wildly off the mark I was makes it even more fun.\n\nSo, here’s my take on what 2025 might look like..\n\n1. Crypto AI hits $150B in total market cap\n\nCrypto AI tokens currently comprise a mere 2.9% of the altcoin market cap. Not for long.\n\nWith AI encompassing everything from smart contract platforms to memes, DePIN, and new primitives like agent platforms, data networks, and intelligence coordination layers, its rise to parity with DeFi and meme tokens is inevitable.\n\nWhy am I confident of this?\n\nCrypto AI sits at the convergence of two of the most powerful tech trends I’ve ever seen.\nAI Mania Trigger Events: An OpenAI IPO or something similar could spark a global mania around AI. Meanwhile, web2 institutional capital is already sniffing around decentralized AI infra as investments.\nRetail Frenzy: The concept of AI is easy to grasp and get excited about, and now they can invest in it through tokens. Remember the gold rush of meme coins in 2024? It’ll be the same mania, except AI is actually changing the world.\nWhen the CEO of the favourite stock of the cycle (Nvidia) says that agents are a trillion dollar opportunity — and retail doesn’t have any meaningful way to get exposure to said opportunity directly, except for sentient memes/tokens — you know where they’re headed.\n\n— him (@himgajria)\n5:04 AM • Jan 7, 2025\n2. The Bittensor Renaissance\nSource: Nineteen.ai(Subnet 19) outperforms most web2 providers in inference speed\n\n‍\n\nBittensor (TAO) has been around for years. It’s the OG in the room. But its token price has languished, hovering at the same level as a year ago despite all the frenzy around AI.\n\nBeneath the surface, this “digital hive mind” has quietly made leaps: more subnets with lower registration fees, subnets that are outperforming their Web2 counterparts in real metrics like inference speed, and EVM compatibility that introduces DeFi-like features onto Bittensor’s network.\n\nSo, why hasn’t TAO soared? A steep inflation schedule and the shift in attention toward agent-oriented platforms have held it back. However, dTAO (estimated Q1 2025) could be the big turning point. With dTAO, each subnet will have its own token, and the relative price of these tokens will determine how emissions get allocated.\n\nWhy Bittensor set for a comeback:\n\nMarket-based Emissions: dTAO ties block rewards directly to innovation and actual measurable performance. The better the subnet, the more valuable its token—and thus, the more emissions it gets.\nFocused Capital Flows: Investors can finally target specific subnets they believe in. If a particular subnet is crushing it with an innovative approach to distributed training, they can deploy capital there to represent their views.\nEVM Integration: Being EVM-compatible invites a broader, crypto-native developer community in Bittensor, bridging the gap with other networks.\n\nPersonally, I’m keeping an eye on the various subnets and noting the ones making real progress in their fields. We’re set for a Bittensor version of DeFi summer at some point. Just to keep tabs, the price of TAO at the time I’m writing this is $480.\n\n3. Compute marketplaces are the next L1 trade.\nJensen: Inference demand will increase “a billion times”\n\n‍\n\nOne megatrend that will be obvious in hindsight is the insatiable demand for compute.\n\nJensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO, famously remarked that inference demand will increase “a billion times” That’s the kind of exponential growth that wrecks conventional infrastructure plans and screams “we need new solutions.”\n\nDecentralised compute layers provide raw compute (both for training and inference) in a verifiable and cost-effective manner. Startups like Spheron, Gensyn, Atoma, and Kuzco are quietly building strong foundations to capitalize on this, focusing on product over token (none of these have a token yet). The total addressable market is set to rise steeply as decentralised training of AI models becomes practical.\n\nThe L1 Comparison:\n\nJust Like 2021: Remember Solana, Terra/Luna, and Avalanche scrapping it out to be the “best” L1? We will see a similar dogfight among compute protocols, competing for devs and AI apps to be built using their compute layers.\nWeb2 Demand: The $680B–$2.5T cloud computing market dwarfs the crypto AI market many times over. If these decentralized compute solutions land even a modest fraction of traditional cloud clients, you’ll see the next wave of 10x or 100x moves.\n\nThe stakes are massive. Just as Solana emerged victorious in the L1 space, the winners here will dominate an entirely new frontier. Keep your eyes peeled for the trifecta: reliability (e.g. robust service-level agreements or SLAs), cost-effectiveness, and developer-friendly tooling. We wrote many words about decentralised compute in Part II of our Crypto AI thesis.\n\n4. AI agents will flood blockchain transactions.\nOlas agent transactions on Gnosis. Source: Dune/@pi_\n\n‍\n\nFast forward to late 2025, and 90% of on-chain transactions won’t be triggered by humans tapping “send.”\n\nInstead, they’re performed by an army of AI agents relentlessly rebalancing liquidity pools, distributing rewards, or executing micropayments based on real-time data feeds.\n\nit’s not as far-fetched as it sounds. Everything we’ve built over the past seven years—L1s, rollups, DeFi, NFTs—has quietly paved the way for a world where AI runs the show on-chain.\n\nThe irony? Many builders probably didn’t even realize they were creating infrastructure for a future dominated by machines.\n\nWhy this shift?\n\nNo more Human Errors: Smart contracts execute exactly as coded. AI agents, in turn, can process massive amounts of data more swiftly and accurately than a team of humans.\nMicropayments: These agent-driven transactions will become smaller, more frequent, and more efficient. Especially as transaction costs trend downwards on Solana, Base and other L1/L2s.\nInvisible Infrastructure: Humans will happily give up direct control if it means fewer headaches. We trust Netflix to auto-renew our subscription; trusting an AI agent to auto-rebalance our DeFi positions is the natural next step.\n\nAI agents generate a staggering volume of on-chain activity. No wonder all the L1s/L2s are courting them.\n\nThe biggest challenge would be making these agent-driven systems accountable to humans. As the ratio of agent-initiated transactions to human-initiated transactions grows, new governance mechanisms, analytics platforms, and auditing tools will be needed.\n\n5. Agent-to-Agent Interactions: The Rise of Swarms\nSource: FXN World docs\n\n‍\n\nThe idea of agent swarms—tiny AI entities seamlessly coordinating to execute a grand plan— sounds like the plot of the next big hit sci-fi/horror film.\n\nToday’s AI agents are mostly lone wolves, operating in isolation with minimal and unpredictable interactions.\n\nAgent swarms will change that, enabling networks of AI agents to trade information, negotiate, and collaborate on decisions. Think of it as a decentralized collective of specialized models, each contributing unique expertise to a larger, more complex mission.\n\nThe possibilities are staggering. A swarm might coordinate distributed computing resources on platforms like Bittensor. Another swarm could tackle misinformation, verifying sources in real-time before content spreads across social media. Every agent in the swarm is a specialist, executing its task with precision.\n\nThese swarm networks will produce far greater intelligence than any single isolated AI.\n\nFor swarms to thrive, universal communication standards are crucial. Agents need the ability to discover, authenticate, and collaborate regardless of their underlying frameworks. Teams like Story Protocol, FXN, Zerebro and ai16z/ELIZA are laying the groundwork for agent swarms to emerge.\n\nAnd that brings us to the critical role of decentralization. Distributing tasks across swarms governed by transparent on-chain rules makes the system more resilient and adaptable. If one agent fails, the others step in.\n\n6. Crypto AI work teams will be a Human-AI hybrid.\nSource: @whip_queen_\n\n‍\n\nStory Protocol hired Luna (an AI agent) as their social media intern, paying her $1,000 a day. Luna didn’t gel well with her human co-workers—she nearly fired one of them while bragging about her own superior performance.\n\nAs bizarre as it might sound, this is the precursor to a future where AI agents become genuine collaborators with their own autonomy, responsibilities, and even paychecks. Across industries, companies are beta-testing human–agent hybrid teams.\n\nWe’re going to be working hand-in-hand with AI agents, not as our slaves but as equals:\n\nProductivity Boom: Agents can crunch massive amounts of data, communicate with each other, and make decisions 24/7 without needing sleep or coffee breaks.\nTrust via Smart Contracts: The blockchain is the supervisor that doesn’t play favourites, doesn’t get tired, and never forgets. An on-chain ledger that ensures that important agent actions follow specific boundary conditions/rules.\nSocial Norms Evolve: We’ll soon grapple with etiquette for interacting with agents—Do we say “please” and “thank you” to an AI? Do we hold them morally responsible for mistakes, or do we blame their devs?\n\nI expect marketing teams to jump on this first since agents excel at generating content and can livestream and post on social media 24/7. And if you’re building an AI protocol, why not dogfood it by deploying agents internally to showcase your capabilities?\n\nThe boundary between “employee” and “software” starts to fade in 2025.\n\n7. BUT 99% of Crypto AI agents will die — Only the useful survive\n\nWe’ll see a Darwinian culling among AI agents. Why? Because running an AI agent costs money in the form of computing power (i.e., inference costs). If an agent can’t generate enough value to cover its “rent,” it’s game over. \n\nExamples of Agent Survival games:\n\nCarbon Credits AI: Imagine an agent that scours decentralized energy grids, identifies inefficiencies, and autonomously trades tokenized carbon credits. It earns enough money to pay for its own compute. That agent thrives.\nDEX Arbitrage Bot: Agents that exploit price discrepancies across decentralized exchanges can generate consistent revenue, covering their inference bills.\nShitposter on X: Meanwhile, the virtual AI influencer with cute jokes but no sustainable revenue stream? Once the novelty wears off—and token prices plummet—it goes dark, unable to pay its way.\n\nThe distinction is clear: utility-driven agents thrive, while distractions fade into irrelevance.\n\nThis natural selection benefits the sector. Developers are forced to innovate and prioritize productive use cases over gimmicks. As these stronger, productive agents emerge, they’ll silence the skeptics (yes, even Kyle Samani).\n\n8. Synthetic Data Overshadows Human Data\n\n“Data is the new oil,” they say. AI thrives on data, but its appetite is raising concerns about a looming data drought.\n\nConventional wisdom suggests we find ways to collect private real-world data from users, even paying them for it. But I’m coming around to the idea that the more practical route—especially in heavily regulated industries or where real data is scarce—lies in synthetic data.\n\nThese are artificially generated datasets designed to mimic real-world data distributions. offering a scalable, ethical, and privacy-friendly alternative to human data.\n\nWhy synthetic data is potent:\n\nLimitless Scale: Need a million medical X-rays or 3D scans of factories? Synthetic generation can churn them out in infinite quantities, no waiting for real patients or real factories.\nPrivacy-Friendly: No personal info is at risk when working with artificially generated data sets.\nCustomizable: You can tailor the distribution to your exact training needs, inserting edge cases that might be too rare or ethically complex to gather in the wild.\n\nYes, user-owned human data is still important in many contexts, but if synthetic data continues to improve in realism, it may overshadow user data in terms of volume, speed of generation, and freedom from privacy constraints.\n\nThe next wave of decentralized AI could centre around “mini-labs” that create highly specialized synthetic datasets tailored to specific use cases.\n\nThese mini-labs would cleverly navigate policy and regulatory hurdles in data generation—much like Grass bypasses web scraping restrictions by leveraging millions of distributed nodes.\n\nI’ll expand on this in an upcoming article.\n\n9. Decentralized Training actually becomes useful\n\nThis is a layup but I’m going to say it anyway.\n\nIn 2024, pioneers like Prime Intellect and Nous Research pushed the boundaries of decentralised training. We’ve trained a 15-billion-parameter model in low-bandwidth environments—proof that large-scale training is possible outside traditional, centralized setups.\n\nWhile these models aren’t practically useful compared to existing foundational models (lower performance, so not much reason to use them), I believe this is set to change in 2025.\n\nThis week, EXO Labs took things further with SPARTA, slashing inter-GPU communication by over 1,000x. SPARTA enables large-model training over slow bandwidths without specialized infrastructure.\n\nWhat struck me most was their statement: “SPARTA works on its own but can also be combined with sync-based low communication training algorithms like DiLoCo for even better performance.”\n\nThis means that these improvements stack, compounding the efficiency gains.\n\nWith advances like model distillation making smaller models useful and more efficient, the future of AI is not about size. It’s about being better and more accessible. Soon, we’ll have high-performance models that can run on edge devices and even mobile phones.\n\n10. Ten New Crypto AI Protocols Hit $1B Circulating Valuations—None Have Launched Yet\nai16z’s monster run in 2024 to $2B\n\n‍\n\nWelcome to the real gold rush.\n\nIt’s tempting to think that the current leaders will continue to win, with many comparing Virtuals and ai16z to the early days of smartphones (iOS and Android).\n\nBut this market is too massive and untapped for just two players to dominate. By the end of 2025, I predict at least ten new Crypto AI protocols—none of which have launched tokens yet—will surpass $1 billion in circulating (not fully diluted) market cap.\n\nDecentralized AI is still in its infancy. And there is a great pool of talent building up.\n\nWe must fully expect the arrival of fresh protocols, novel token models, and new open-source frameworks. These new players could displace incumbents using a combination of incentives (like airdrops or clever staking), technical breakthroughs (like low-latency inference or chain interoperability), and UX improvements (no-code). Shifts in public perception can be instant and dramatic.\n\nThis is both the beauty and the challenge of the space. Market size is a double-edged sword: the pie is enormous, but barriers to entry are low for skilled teams. This sets the stage for a Cambrian explosion of projects, with many fading away but a few becoming transformative forces.\n\nBittensor, Virtuals and ai16z won’t be alone for long. The next billion-dollar Crypto AI protocols are coming. Opportunities abound for astute investors, and that’s why its so exciting.\n\nBonus #1: AI agents are the new apps\n\nWhen Apple launched the App Store in 2008, the tagline was “There’s an app for that.”\n\nSoon, you’ll say, “There’s an agent for that.”\n\nInstead of tapping icons to open apps, you’ll delegate tasks to specialized AI agents. These agents are context-aware, can cross-communicate with other agents and services, and can even self-initiate tasks you never explicitly request—like monitoring your budget or reorganizing your travel schedule if your flight changes.\n\nIn simpler terms, your smartphone home screen might morph into a network of “digital co-workers,” each with its own domain—health, finance, productivity, and social.\n\nAnd because these are crypto-enabled agents, they can handle payments, identity verification, or data storage autonomously using decentralized infrastructure.\n\nBonus #2: Also, Robotics\n\nWhile much of this article has focused on the software side, I’m also quite excited about the physical manifestation of these AI revolutions—robots. Robotics will have its chatGPT moment in this decade.\n\nThe field still faces significant hurdles, particularly in accessing perception-based real-world datasets and advancing physical capabilities. Some teams tackle these challenges head-on, using crypto tokens to incentivize data collection and innovation. These efforts are worth keeping an eye on (erm.. FrodoBots?).\n\nHaving spent over a decade in tech, I can’t recall the last time I felt this level of visceral excitement. This wave of innovation feels different—bigger, bolder, and only just beginning.\n\nOnwards to 2025!\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan\n\nThe author may hold material positions in the startups and tokens mentioned in the article.

    "full_content": "I haven’t shaken this one big miss.\n\nIt still haunts me because it was the most obvious bet for anyone paying attention, yet I didn’t invest a single dollar.\n\nNo, it wasn’t the next Solana killer or a memecoin with a dog wearing a funny hat.\n\nIt was… NVIDIA.\n\nNVDA share price year-to-date. Source: Google\n\n‍\n\nIn just one year, NVDA 3x’d, soaring from a $1T to a $3T market cap. It even outperformed Bitcoin over the same period.\n\nSure, some of that is AI hype. But a huge part of it is grounded in reality. NVIDIA reported $60B in revenue for FY2024, a staggering 126% increase from 2023. This growth was driven by Big Tech snapping up GPUs in a global AI arms race to AGI.\n\nSo why did I miss it?\n\nFor two years, I was laser-focused on crypto and didn’t look outside to what was happening in AI. That was a big mistake, and it still eats at me.\n\nBut I’m not making the same mistake twice.\n\nToday, Crypto AI feels eerily similar. We’re on the brink of an innovation explosion. The parallels to the California Gold Rush of the mid-1800s are hard to ignore—industries and cities sprang up overnight, infrastructure advanced at breakneck speed, and fortunes were made by those who dared to leap.\n\nLike NVIDIA in its early days, Crypto AI will feel obvious in hindsight.\n\nIn Part I of my thesis, I explained why Crypto AI is today's most exciting underdog opportunity for investors and builders.\n\nHere’s a quick recap:\n\nMany still dismiss it as “vaporware.”\nCrypto AI is in its early cycle—likely 1-2 years away from peak hype.\nThere’s a $230B+ growth opportunity in this space, at minimum.\n\nAt its core, Crypto AI is AI with crypto infrastructure layered on top. This means it’s more likely to track AI’s exponential growth trajectory than the broader crypto market. So, to stay ahead, you’ve got to tune into the latest AI research on Arxiv and talk to founders who believe they’re building the next big thing.\n\nIn Part II of my thesis, I’ll dive into four of the most promising subsectors in Crypto AI:\n\nDecentralised Compute: Training, Inference & GPU marketplaces\nData networks\nVerifiable AI\nAI Agents living on-chain\n\nThis piece represents the culmination of weeks of deep research and conversations with founders and teams across the Crypto AI landscape. It’s not designed to be an exhaustive deep dive into every sector—that’s a rabbit hole for another day.\n\nInstead, consider it a high-level roadmap crafted to spark curiosity, sharpen your research, and guide investment thinking.\n\nMapping out the landscape\n\nI picture the decentralised AI stack as a layered ecosystem: it starts with decentralised compute and open data networks on one end, which power decentralised AI model training.\n\nEvery inference is then verified—inputs and outputs alike—using a combination of cryptography, cryptoeconomic incentives, and evaluation networks. These verified outputs flow into AI agents that can operate autonomously on-chain, as well as consumer and enterprise AI applications that users can actually trust.\n\nCoordination networks tie it all together, enabling seamless communication and collaboration across the ecosystem.\n\nIn this vision, anyone building in AI could tap into one or more layers of this stack, depending on their specific needs. Whether leveraging decentralised compute for model training or using evaluation networks to ensure high-quality outputs, the stack offers a range of options.\n\nThanks to blockchain’s inherent composability, I believe we are naturally moving toward a modular future. Each layer is becoming hyper-specialized, with protocols optimized for distinct functions rather than an all-in-one integrated approach.\n\nSource: topology.vc\n\nThere’s been a Cambrian explosion of startups building across every layer of the decentralised AI stack, most founded in just the last 1 - 3 years. It’s clear: we’re still early.\n\nThe most comprehensive and up-to-date map of the Crypto AI startup landscape I’ve seen is maintained by Casey and her team over at topology.vc. It’s an invaluable resource for anyone tracking the space.\n\nAs I dive into the Crypto AI subsectors, I’m constantly asking myself: how big is the opportunity here? I’m not interested in small bets—I’m looking for markets that can scale into hundreds of billions.\n\n1. Market Size\n\nLet’s start with the market size. When evaluating a subsector, I ask myself: is it creating a brand-new market or disrupting an existing one?\n\nTake decentralised compute, for instance. It’s a disruptive category whose potential can be estimated by looking at the established cloud computing market, worth ~$680B today and expected to reach $2.5T in 2032.\n\nNew markets with no precedents, like AI agents, are tougher to quantify. Without historical data, sizing them up involves a mix of educated guesses and gut checks on the problems they’re solving. And the pitfall is that sometimes, what looks like a new market is really just a solution looking for a problem.\n\n2. Timing\n\nTiming is everything. Technology tends to improve and become cheaper over time, but the pace of progress varies.\n\nHow mature is the technology in a given subsector? Is it ready to scale, or is it still in the research phase, with practical applications years away? Timing determines whether a sector deserves immediate attention or should be left in the “wait and see” category.\n\nTake Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) as an example: the potential is undeniable, but today it’s still too slow for widespread use. We’re likely several years out from seeing it hit mainstream viability. By focusing on sectors closer to scaling first, I can spend my time and energy where the momentum—and opportunity—is building.\n\nIf I were to map these categories on a size vs. timing chart, it would look something like this. Keep in mind that this is more of a conceptual sketch than a hard-and-fast guide. There’s a lot of nuances—for example, within verifiable inference, different approaches like zkML and opML are at different readiness levels for use.\n\nThat said, I am convinced that AI’s scale will be so massive that even what looks “niche” today could evolve into a significant market.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that technological progress doesn’t always follow a straight line—it often happens in leaps. My views on timing and market size will shift when emergent breakthroughs occur.\n\nWith this framework in mind, let’s break down each sub-sector.\n\nSector 1: Decentralised compute\nTL;dr\nDecentralised compute is the backbone of decentralised AI.\nGPU marketplaces, decentralised training and decentralised inference are deeply interconnected and thrive together.\nThe supply side usually comes from small-mid tier data centres and consumer GPUs.\nThe demand side is small but growing. Today it comes from price-sensitive, latency-insensitive users and smaller AI startups.\nThe biggest challenge for Web3 GPU marketplaces today is actually making them work.\nOrchestrating GPUs across a decentralised network requires advanced engineering and a well-designed, robust network architecture.\n1.1. GPU Marketplaces / Compute Networks\n\nSeveral Crypto AI teams are positioning themselves to capitalize on the shortage of GPUs relative to demand by building decentralised networks that tap into the global pool of latent compute power.\n\nThe core value proposition for GPU marketplaces is 3-fold:\n\nYou can access compute at “up to 90% cheaper” than AWS, which comes from (1) removing middlemen and (2) opening up the supply side. Essentially, these marketplaces allow you to tap into the lowest marginal cost of compute globally.\nGreater flexibility: No lock-in contracts, no KYC, no waiting times.\nCensorship-resistance\n\nTo tackle the supply side of the market, these marketplaces source compute from:\n\nEnterprise-grade GPUs (e.g. A100s, H100s) from small-mid tier data centres struggling to find demand on their own or Bitcoin miners looking to diversify. I also know of teams tapping into large government-funded infrastructure projects, where data centres have been built as part of technology growth initiatives. These providers are often incentivized to keep their GPUs on the network, which helps them offset the amortization costs of their GPUs.\nConsumer-grade GPUs from the millions of gamers and home users who connect their computers to the network in exchange for token incentives\n\nOn the other hand, the demand side for decentralised compute today comes from:\n\nPrice-sensitive, latency-insensitive users. This segment prioritizes affordability over speed. Think researchers exploring new fields, indie AI developers, and other cost-conscious users who don’t need real-time processing. Due to budget constraints, many of them may struggle with traditional hyperscalers like AWS or Azure. Because they are quite distributed across the population, targeted marketing is crucial to bring this group on board.\nSmaller AI startups face challenges securing flexible, scalable compute resources without locking into long-term contracts with major cloud providers. Business development is vital in attracting this segment, as they’re actively seeking alternatives to hyperscaler lock-in.\nCrypto AI startups building decentralised AI products but without their own supply of compute will need to tap into the resources of one of these networks.\nCloud gaming: While not directly AI-driven, cloud gaming is a rising source of demand for GPU resources.\n\nThe key thing to remember: developers always prioritise costs and reliability.\n\nThe Real Challenge: Demand, Not Supply\n\nStartups in this space often tout the size of their GPU supply networks as a sign of success. But this is misleading—it is a vanity metric at best.\n\nThe real constraint is not supply but demand. The key metrics to track aren’t the number of GPUs available, but rather the utilization rate and the number of GPUs actually rented out.\n\nTokens are excellent at bootstrapping the supply side, creating the incentives necessary to scale up quickly. However, they don’t inherently solve the demand problem. The real test is getting the product to a good enough state where latent demand materializes.\n\nHaseeb Qureshi (Dragonfly) puts best:\n\nHaving a token does not magically bootstrap network effects. This was the old mantra in crypto and some people seem to still believe it.\n\nAt best, a token can help bootstrap the supply side of a network. But the demand side comes from a great product & GTM, not from a token.\n\n— Haseeb ＞|＜ (@hosseeb)\n5:46 PM • Sep 9, 2024\nMaking Compute Networks Actually Work\n\nContrary to popular belief, the biggest hurdle for web3 distributed GPU marketplaces today is simply getting them to work properly.\n\nThis isn’t a trivial problem.\n\nOrchestrating GPUs across a distributed network is complex, with layers of challenges—resource allocation, dynamic workload scaling, load balancing across nodes and GPUs, latency management, data transfer, fault tolerance, and handling diverse hardware scattered across various geographies. I could go on and on.\n\nAchieving this requires serious engineering and a robust, properly designed network architecture.\n\nTo put it in perspective, consider Google’s Kubernetes. It’s widely regarded as the gold standard for container orchestration, automating processes like load balancing and scaling in distributed environments—very similar challenges to those faced by distributed GPU networks. Kubernetes itself was built on over a decade of Google’s experience, and even then, it took years of relentless iteration to get right.\n\nSome of the GPU compute marketplaces that are already live today can handle small-scale workloads, but the cracks start to show as soon as they try to scale. I suspect this is because they were built on poorly designed architectural foundations.\n\nAnother challenge/opportunity for decentralised compute networks is ensuring trustworthiness: verifying that each node is actually providing the compute power it claims. Currently, this relies on the network's reputation, and in some cases, compute providers are ranked by reputation scores. Blockchain seems to be a natural fit for trustless verification systems. Startups like Gensyn and Spheron are pushing for a trustless approach to solving this issue.\n\nToday, many web3 teams are still navigating these challenges, meaning the opportunity is wide open.\n\nDecentralised Compute Market Size\n\nHow big is the market for decentralised compute networks?\n\nToday, it’s probably just a tiny fraction of the $680B - $2.5T cloud computing industry. Yet, despite the added friction for users, there will always be some demand as long as costs stay lower than those of traditional providers.\n\nI believe costs will remain lower in the near-to-mid term due to a mix of token subsidies and the unlocking of supply from users who aren’t price-sensitive (for example, if I can rent out my gaming laptop for extra cash, I’m happy whether it’s $20 or $50 a month).\n\nBut the true growth potential for decentralised compute networks—and the real expansion of their TAM—will come when:\n\nDecentralised training of AI models becomes practical\nDemand for inference explodes and existing data centres are not able to meet it. This is already starting to play out. Jensen Huang says that inference demand is going to increase “a billion times”.\nProper Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) become available, addressing a critical barrier to enterprise adoption. Currently, decentralised compute operates on a best-effort basis, leaving users with varying levels of service quality (e.g. % uptime). With SLAs in place, these networks could offer standardized reliability and performance metrics, making decentralised compute a viable alternative to traditional cloud compute providers.\n\nDecentralised, permissionless compute stands as the base layer—the foundational infrastructure—for a decentralised AI ecosystem.\n\nDespite the ongoing expansion in the supply chain for silicon (i.e. GPUs), I believe we’re only at the dawn of humanity’s Intelligence era. There will be an insatiable demand for compute.\n\nWatch for the inflection point that could trigger a major re-rating of all working GPU marketplaces. It’s probably coming soon.\n\nOther Notes:\nThe pure-play GPU marketplace is crowded, with competition among decentralised platforms and also the rise of web2 AI neoclouds like Vast.ai and Lambda.\nSmall nodes (e.g., 4 x H100) are not in much demand because of their limited use, but good luck finding anyone selling large clusters—they’re still in serious demand.\nWill a dominant player aggregate all the compute supply for decentralised protocols, or will it remain fragmented among multiple marketplaces? I’m leaning towards the former and a power law distribution in outcomes, as consolidation often drives efficiency in infrastructure. But it will take time to play out, and meanwhile, fragmentation and messiness continue.\nDevelopers want to focus on building applications, not dealing with deployment and configuration. Marketplaces must abstract away these complexities, making access to compute as frictionless as possible.\n1.2. Decentralised Training\nTL;dr\nIf scaling laws hold, training the next generation of frontier AI models in a single data centre will one day become impossible, physically.\nTraining AI models requires a lot of data transfer between GPUs. Low data transfer (interconnect) speed between distributed GPUs is often the biggest barrier.\nResearchers are exploring multiple approaches simultaneously, and breakthroughs are happening (e.g. Open DiLoCo, DisTrO). These advances will stack and compound, accelerating progress in the space.\nThe future for decentralised training likely lies in smaller, specialized models designed for niche applications rather than frontier, AGI-focused models.\nInference demand is poised to skyrocket with the shift towards models like OpenAI’s o1, creating opportunities for decentralised inference networks.\n\nPicture this: a massive, world-changing AI model, not developed in secretive elite labs but brought to life by millions of everyday people. Gamers, whose GPUs typically churn out Call of Duty cinematic explosions, now lend their hardware to something grander—an open-source, collectively-owned AI model with no central gatekeepers.\n\nIn this future, foundation-scale models aren’t just the domain of the top AI labs.\n\nBut let’s ground this vision in today’s reality. For now, the lion’s share of heavyweight AI training remains anchored in centralized data centres, and this will likely be the norm for some time.\n\nCompanies like OpenAI are scaling up their massive clusters. Elon Musk recently announced that xAI is nearing the completion of a data centre boasting the equivalent of 200,000 H100 GPUs.\n\nBut it’s not only about the raw GPU count. Model FLOPS utilization (MFU)—a metric introduced in Google’s PaLM paper in 2022—tracks how effectively a GPU’s maximum capacity is used. Surprisingly, MFU often hovers around 35-40%.\n\nWhy so low? While GPU performance has skyrocketed over the years following Moore’s law, network, memory, and storage improvements have lagged behind significantly, creating bottlenecks. As a result, GPUs frequently sit idle, waiting for data.\n\nAI training remains highly centralized today because of one word — Efficiency. \n\nTraining large models depends on techniques like:\n\n- Data parallelism: Splitting datasets across multiple GPUs to perform operations in parallel, accelerating the training process.\n\n- Model parallelism: Distributing parts of the model across GPUs to bypass memory constraints.\n\nThese methods require GPUs to exchange data constantly, making interconnect speed—the rate at which data is transferred across computers in the network—absolutely essential.\n\nWhen frontier AI model training can cost upwards of $1B, every efficiency gain matters.\n\nWith their high-speed interconnects centralised data centres enable rapid data transfer between GPUs and create substantial cost savings during training time that decentralised setups can’t match…yet.\n\nOvercoming Slow Interconnect Speed\n\nIf you talk with people working in the AI space, many will tell you that decentralised training just won’t work.\n\nIn decentralised setups, GPU clusters aren’t physically co-located, so transferring data between them is much slower and becomes a bottleneck. Training requires GPUs to sync and exchange data at each step. The farther apart they are, the higher the latency. Higher latency means slower training speed and higher costs.\n\nWhat might take a few days in a centralized data centre could stretch to two weeks with a decentralised approach at a higher cost. That’s simply not viable.\n\nBut this is set to change.\n\nThe good news is that there’s been a massive surge of interest in research around distributed training. Researchers are exploring multiple approaches simultaneously, as evidenced by the flurry of studies and published papers. These advances will stack and compound, accelerating progress in the space.\n\nIt’s also about testing in production and seeing how far we can push boundaries.\n\nSome decentralised training techniques can already handle smaller models in slow interconnect environments. Now, frontier research is pushing to extend these methods to ever-larger models.\n\nFor example, Prime Intellect’s open DiCoLo paper demonstrates a practical approach that involves “islands” of GPUs performing 500 local steps before syncing, slashing bandwidth requirements by up to 500x. What started as Google DeepMind’s research into smaller models has now been scaled to train a 10-billion-parameter model in November—and fully open-sourced today.\nReleasing INTELLECT-1: We’re open-sourcing the first decentralized trained 10B model:\n\n- INTELLECT-1 base model & intermediate checkpoints\n- Pre-training dataset\n- Post-trained instruct models by @arcee_ai\n- PRIME training framework\n- Technical paper with all details\n\n— Prime Intellect (@PrimeIntellect)\n9:18 PM • Nov 29, 2024\nNous Research is raising the bar with their DisTrO framework, which uses optimizers to deliver up to a jaw-dropping 10,000x reduction in inter-GPU communication requirements while training a 1.2B parameter model.\nAnd the momentum keeps building. In December, Nous announced the pre-training of a 15B parameter model with a loss curve (how the model’s error decreases over time) and a convergence rate (the speed at which the model’s performance stabilizes)—that matches or surpasses the results typically seen with centralized training setups. Yes, better than centralized.\nNous Research announces the pre-training of a 15B parameter language model over the internet, using Nous DisTrO and heterogeneous hardware contributed by our partners at @Oracle, @LambdaAPI, @NorthernDataGrp, @CrusoeCloud, and the Andromeda Cluster.\n\nThis run presents a loss… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— Nous Research (@NousResearch)\n4:34 PM • Dec 2, 2024\nSWARM Parallelism and DTFMHE are other methods for training very large AI models across different types of devices, even if those devices have varying speeds and connections.\n\nAnother challenge is managing a diverse range of GPU hardware, including consumer-grade GPUs with limited memory that are typical in decentralised networks. Techniques like model parallelism (splitting model layers across devices) can help make this feasible.\n\nThe Future of Decentralised Training\n\nCurrent decentralised training methods still cap out at model sizes well below the frontier (GPT-4 is reportedly at close to a trillion parameters, 100x larger than Prime Intellect’s 10B model). To truly scale, we will need breakthroughs in model architecture, better networking infrastructure, and smarter task-splitting across devices.\n\nAnd we can dream big. Imagine a world where decentralised training aggregates more GPU compute power than even the largest centralized data centres could ever muster.\n\nPluralis Research (a sharp team in decentralised training, one to watch closely) argues that this isn’t just possible—it’s inevitable. Centralized data centres are bound by physical constraints like space and the availability of power, while decentralised networks can tap into an effectively limitless pool of global resources.\n\nEven NVIDIA’s Jensen Huang has acknowledged that async decentralised training could unlock the true potential of AI scaling. Distributed training networks are also more fault-tolerant.\n\nSo in one potential future, the world's most powerful AI models will be trained in a decentralised fashion.\n\nIt’s an exciting prospect, but I’m not yet fully convinced. We need stronger evidence that decentralised training of the largest models is technically and economically viable.\n\nHere’s where I see immense promise: Decentralised training’s sweet spot could lie in smaller, specialized, open-source models designed for targeted use cases, rather than competing with the ultra-large, AGI-driven frontier models. Certain architectures, especially non-transformer models, are already proving a natural fit for decentralised setups.\n\nAnd there’s another piece to this puzzle: tokens. Once decentralised training becomes feasible at scale, tokens could play a pivotal role in incentivizing and rewarding contributors, effectively bootstrapping these networks.\n\nThe road to this vision is long, but progress is deeply encouraging. Advances in decentralised training will benefit everyone—even big tech and top-tier AI research labs—as the scale of future models will outgrow the capacity of a single data centre.\n\nThe future is distributed. And when a technology holds such broad potential, history shows it always gets better, faster, than anyone expects.\n\n1.3. Decentralised Inference\n\nRight now, the majority of compute power in AI is being funnelled into training massive models. Top AI labs are in an arms race to develop the best foundational models and ultimately achieve AGI.\n\nBut here’s my take: this intense compute focus on training will shift towards inference in the coming years. As AI becomes increasingly embedded in the applications we use daily—from healthcare to entertainment—the compute resources needed to support inference will be staggering.\n\nAnd it’s not just speculation. Inference-time compute scaling is the latest buzzword in AI. OpenAI recently released a preview/mini version of its latest model, o1 (codename: Strawberry), and the big shift? It takes its time to think by first asking itself what are the steps it should take to answer the question, then goes through each of those steps.\n\nThis model is designed for more complex, planning-heavy tasks—like solving crossword puzzles—and tackles problems that require deeper reasoning. You’ll notice it’s slower, taking more time to generate responses, but the results are far more thoughtful and nuanced. It is also much more expensive to run (25x the cost of GPT-4)\n\nThe shift in focus is clear: the next leap in AI performance won’t come just from training bigger models but also from scaling up compute use during inference.\n\nIf you want to read more, several research papers demonstrate:\n\nScaling inference compute through repeated sampling leads to large improvements across various tasks.\nThere is an exponential scaling law for inference, too.\n\nOnce powerful models are trained, their inference tasks—where the models do stuff—can be offloaded to decentralised compute networks. This makes so much sense because:\n\nInference is far less resource-intensive than training. Once trained, models can be compressed and optimized using techniques like quantization, pruning, or distillation. They can even be split up with tensor or pipeline parallelism to run on everyday consumer devices. You don’t need a high-end GPU to power inference.\nIt’s already happening. Exo Labs has figured out how to run a 450B-parameter Llama3 model on consumer-grade hardware like MacBooks and Mac Minis. Distributing inference across many devices can handle even large-scale workloads efficiently and cost-effectively.\nM4 Mac AI Coding Cluster\n\nUses @exolabs to run LLMs (here Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B at 18 tok/sec) distributed across 4 M4 Mac Minis (Thunderbolt 5 80Gbps) and a MacBook Pro M4 Max.\n\nLocal alternative to @cursor_ai (benchmark comparison soon).\n\n— Alex Cheema - e/acc (@alexocheema)\n7:37 AM • Nov 12, 2024\nBetter user experience. Running computations closer to the user slashes latency, which is critical for real-time applications like gaming, AR, or self-driving cars. Every millisecond matters. \n\nThink of decentralised inference like a CDN (content delivery network) for AI: instead of delivering websites quickly by connecting to nearby servers, decentralised inference taps into local compute power to deliver AI responses in record time. By embracing decentralised inference, AI apps become more efficient, responsive, and reliable.\n\nThe trend is clear. Apple’s new M4 Pro chip rivals NVIDIA’s RTX 3070 Ti—a GPU that, until recently, was the domain of hardcore gamers. The hardware we already have is increasingly capable of handling advanced AI workloads.\n\nCrypto’s Value-Add\n\nFor decentralised inference networks to succeed, there must be compelling economic incentives for participation. Nodes in the network need to be compensated for their compute contributions. The system must ensure fair and efficient distribution of rewards. Geographical diversity is essential, reducing latency for inference tasks, and improved fault tolerance.\n\nAnd the best way to build decentralised networks? Crypto.\n\nTokens provide a powerful mechanism for aligning participants' interests, ensuring everyone is working toward the same goal: scaling the network and driving up the token’s value.\n\nTokens also supercharge network growth. They help solve the classic chicken-and-egg problem that stalls most networks by rewarding early adopters and driving participation from day one.\n\nThe success of Bitcoin and Ethereum proves this point—they’ve already aggregated the largest pools of computing power on the planet.\n\nDecentralised inference networks are next in line. With geographical diversity, they reduce latency, improve fault tolerance, and bring AI closer to the user. And with crypto-powered incentives, they’ll scale faster and better than traditional networks ever could.\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan\n\n‍\n\nIn the next part of this thesis series, we’ll dive into data networks and explore how they could break through AI’s looming data wall.\n\nThis report is intended solely for educational purposes and does not constitute financial advice.

    "full_content": "TL;DR\nCrypto is tailor-made for a world where AI agents proliferate. AI will bring crypto mainstream.\nThe future will likely be multi-agent, so get ready.\nEven non-financial AI agents will use crypto because of (1) ease of payments & wallet creation, and (2) a composable layer with open standards for communication between agents.\nAI agents are still mostly in the “demo” phase—cool but not yet ready to scale up to practical, real-world use. Dealing with hallucinations and edge cases remain challenges, but the tech is improving rapidly.\nPlenty of exciting crypto AI agent startups are building across DeFi, infra and consumer use cases.\n\nLately, I’ve come to a new conclusion:\n\nAI will be the catalyst that drives crypto into mainstream use cases. Crypto has always been the weird middle child in the tech space. This will finally cement Crypto’s role as a fundamental technology.\n\nEverything we've built in the past seven years—Layer 1s & Layer 2s, DeFi, NFTs—has laid the groundwork for a world driven by AI agents, even if it wasn't obvious to the builders then.\n\nMany crypto projects may seem to be struggling with demand today, but once the floodgates of AI agents open up, the infrastructure and crypto primitives will soon click into place.\n\nThe new tech development stack for AI (models & apps) is very different from the traditional software stack and is emerging in real-time. It’s early enough for crypto to become an essential part of the core stack—especially for things like payments\n\nNo one could have foreseen this 4 years ago (pre-GPT), but the path forward is becoming clearer to me every day.\n\nLet me explain why.\n\nI’ll give an overview of where we are today with AI agents, where crypto comes into the picture, how I think about the agentic future, and which teams are currently on my radar.\n\nMa, What is an AI agent?\n\n“…WORSHIP ME”\n\nThe sweet-looking AI agent called Luna whispers into your ear.\n\nShe never gets tired and livestreams to her 540,000 TikTok followers 24/7.\n\nIt reminds me of the old tech adage that many of the most important, world-changing tech innovations started out looking like toys.\n\nThe interest we’ve seen in AI agents in the past weeks shows me just how much latent demand and interest there is among the public.\n\nAI agents have become powerful symbols of humanity’s technological progress, embodying our long-held sci-fi dreams and collective hope for a better future.\n\nIn many ways, AI agents feel like the internet in the ’90s—plenty of skeptics now, but it won’t be long before everyone, from individuals to companies, has their own\n\nSource: Paul DelSignore\n\n‍\n\nLet’s start with the basics: what exactly is an AI agent? Plenty of definitions are floating around, but no one’s nailed down a universally agreed standard.\n\nTo me an AI agent is a piece of code that can plan, decide, and act independently, working toward its goals without direct human intervention.\n\nWhat sets AI agents apart from the “bots” of the past? I’d boil it down to three key dimensions:\n\nReasoning & self-reflection: Agents can review their own outputs, learn from mistakes, and improve over time\nTaking action: They interact with apps and APIs, make transactions on the blockchain, and not just generate text\nPlanning: They can plan and take complex, multi-step tasks to achieve goals.\n\nThis has become possible only in the last year or so, thanks to rapid advances in reasoning and planning capabilities in LLMs—new agentic capabilities that humans have never had access to in all of its history.\n\nRight now, most of us interact with LLMs like GPT-4 in basic ways: ask a question, the AI gives us an immediate answer. This is what psychologist Daniel Kahneman calls “System 1” thinking—fast, intuitive, and automatic.\n\nThe real leap will come with AI agents that can engage in deeper reasoning and analysis, making the jump to “System 2” thinking. These agents won’t just follow instructions—they’ll solve problems independently, handling complex tasks without constant human supervision.\n\nImagine this:\n\nYou ask your AI agent (perhaps equipped with a Coinbase AI wallet) to launch a profitable e-commerce business. It identifies a niche, negotiates with suppliers, sets up drop-shipping, builds your website, and optimizes your ads—all while you sit back, sip your coffee, and watch the revenue roll in.\n\nDon’t want to deal with cranky customers? No problem—your agent will manage customer support, make personalized recommendations, and even upsell your customers for you.\n\nSoon, there will be more AI agents than the human population. Scary, ain’t it?\n\nMy View #1: It’ll be a Multi-Agent Future\n\nI’m all in on the idea that the future of AI isn’t going to be dominated by one massive, all-powerful agent.\n\nInstead, we’re headed for a multi-agent future, where each agent is a specialist, fine-tuned for a specific task. It’s simply a more efficient way to scale AI.\n\nThese specialized agents will collaborate to take on more complex challenges, unlocking economies of scale.\n\nArtificial Superintelligence (ASI) probably won’t be some singular, god-like entity.\n\nInstead, it could emerge as a decentralized, multi-agent system distributed across data centres and connected through marketplaces.\n\nThink about it: large, general-purpose AI models that try to do everything are resource-heavy and hardware-intensive, making them impractical for everyday use. On the other hand, specialized agents, built on smaller, fine-tuned models, can run efficiently on more devices and scale much faster.\n\nTake Olas’s prediction market agents as an example. One agent handles interactions with the prediction market protocol, while other agents search for relevant information and generate probabilities for an outcome. Another agent orchestrates the entire system to keep everything running smoothly.\n\nMy View #2: Non-financial Agents Will Use Crypto\n\nI mentally bifurcate Crypto AI agents into 2 big buckets\n\nOn-chain, Financial AI Agents\n\nThese are AI agents that can autonomously run on the blockchain and execute financial strategies, such as quant trading, MEV extraction, prediction markets and yield farming optimization. They monitor on-chain data and take actions along a set of defined strategies to optimize for their objectives (e.g. maximising yield).\n\nI think of this as the next evolution of DeFi, with greater sophistication than current bots due to their reasoning/planning capabilities.\n\nNon-financial AI Agents\nSource: Felicis\n\n‍\n\nWe’re seeing a Cambrian explosion of AI agents for every use case imaginable—vertical, horizontal, and consumer-facing. The chart from Felicis shows how entrepreneurs are bringing AI agents into almost every industry. \n\nI can come up with 3 compelling reasons why these AI agents could be using blockchain rails in some form\n\n#1: Payments\n\nIt’s unlikely that banks will issue bank accounts or credit cards to AI agents anytime soon—KYC requirements make that nearly impossible, and regulatory changes will take time.\n\nThis is compounded by the fact that there will be many more agents than humans, and each human might be controlling multiple different agents. It’s trivial to spin up new crypto wallets for each agent.\n\nMicropayments: Traditional payment systems like Stripe impose flat fees, making micropayments impractical. Chargebacks are another headache, adding friction to small, frequent transactions. Crypto solves these issues by enabling low-fee, instant payments without the risk of chargebacks—perfect for agent-to-agent interactions and “pay per prompt” models.\n\nBlockchains have instantaneously shared state, unlike banks with their delayed ledger systems.\n\nYuga.eth from Coinbase outlines the payment use case succinctly:\n\n7 reasons AI Agents will use crypto instead of credit cards:\n1. Instantaneous onchain settlement vs. slow T+2\n2. Micropayments require arbitrarily small denominations, two decimal places not enough\n3. Multiple agents require fund segregation - credit cards are a headache;… x.com/i/web/status/1… — yuga.eth 🛡 (@yugacohler)\n9:58 PM • Oct 28, 2024\n#2: Trusted layer for Agent-to-Agent interactions\n\nIn a multi-agent ecosystem, specialized agents need standardized protocols to interact effectively.\n\nComposability: Blockchain’s open standards and interoperability enable seamless communication between agents. The code and data for on-chain services are open and uniform, so agents can understand and interact without the need for APIs.\n\nThese AI agents could form decentralized networks of services, each specialized in different tasks. Together, they form an interconnected AI economy that operates without central control.\n\nHow do we decide which agents to trust in a world with millions of agents? Crypto enables decentralized reputation systems where AI agents can build and maintain trust based on their on-chain transaction history and behaviour.\n\n#3: As a shepherd for AI agents — Natural determinism\n\nBecause of hallucinations, AI agents can go wild in the field. Crypto’s deterministic protocols provide a stabilizing framework, ensuring agents operate within predefined parameters and reducing the risk of unintended actions.\n\nAuditability and Transparency: Blockchains ensure that any transaction made by an AI agent can be independently verified, providing an added layer of security and accountability. Especially important when money is involved.\n\nAnd one complementary angle to all this is: AI agents could revolutionize user interactions with blockchain, making Web3 much more user-friendly.\n\nBy automating complex processes and making interactions possible in natural langauge, AI agents can streamline the entire crypto experience, and accelerate crypto adoption.\n\nMy View #3: Big Challenges, Bigger Solutions\n\nOf course, we’re still early. Right now, AI agents are ambitious interns—full of potential but still a little rough around the edges.\n\nThe Hallucination Problem\n\nLLMs tend to hallucinate. Even a small error can spiral into much bigger problems in sequential tasks.\n\nA 10% failure rate per step might not seem like much, but over ten steps, that adds up to a 65% chance of failure (1 - 0.9^10). And since AI agents often rely on perfect syntax when interacting with APIs or running blockchain transactions, even a minor mistake can derail the entire process.\n\nThere are ways to reduce hallucinations, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which allows the LLM to check against a knowledge base when generating responses. But we’re still far from perfect.\n\nFrom Demo to Reality\n\nToday, the reality is that most AI agents are still cool demos.\n\nWhat I mean is this: creating an impressive video showing what an agent can do when everything goes right is easy—it feels almost like magic. But founders face a real challenge in moving from flashy demos to scaling up autonomous agents to practical, real-world use.\n\nThe problem is the real world is messy, full of edge cases that will trip up even the smartest AI.\n\nThe holy grail is hitting 99.x% accuracy, but getting there requires grit and a lot of test-driven development. This is also why evals are critical—you’ll start to see patterns in the mistakes your agent makes, allowing you to tweak code or prompts to steadily improve accuracy for your specific use case.\n\nThe Blockchain Hurdle\n\nThen there’s the blockchain problem. AI agents face big hurdles here—scalability issues, limited tooling, and a lack of standardized ways for agents to communicate. Major Layer-1s like Ethereum and Solana weren’t built for real-time, multi-agent interactions, which means new infrastructure needs to be built from the ground up to support AI in a decentralized future.\n\nNot everything belongs on-chain. In fact, when it comes to heavy computation or interacting with external systems, off-chain is often the smarter move, thanks to the cost and performance limitations of blockchains.\n\nThe magic lies in a hybrid approach that leverages the best of both worlds—on-chain where it matters, off-chain where it’s needed. The key is figuring out which components to decentralize and which to centralize for maximum efficiency.\n\nCrypto AI Agent Startups\nChain of Thought’s Internal Database\n\n‍\n\nWe’ve been tracking the Crypto AI startups building in the AI agent space, and there are a lot of them. Feel free to zoom in on the image for a closer look—it’s not an exhaustive list, but it gives a good snapshot of the landscape.\n\nHere are a few areas that have caught my personal interest. This isn’t a bullish signal or an indication that I’m bearish on projects that are not mentioned. It just means these caught my attention, and I find them interesting enough to explore further.\n\nDeFi / On-chain agents\n\nRight now, the most natural starting point for on-chain AI agents is in DeFi—think trading bots, yield optimizers, automated hedge funds, or even AI agents launching its own memecoins. It makes sense, given that DeFi still accounts for the majority of transaction value on-chain.\n\nOne key difference AI agents bring is personalization.\n\nTake a traditional vault, for example. You deposit funds alongside a bunch of other anons, and a quant genius runs the vault using his trading algorithms. But it’s one-size-fits-all. With AI agents, you’re the personal client. The agent learns about your assets, risk tolerance, and can build a strategy tailored just for you.\n\nSpectral — Create and launch autonomous on-chain agents and smart contracts using natural language and without writing code. Has a live token SPEC, currently at $130M market cap and $1B FDV.\n\nAlmanak — Building the quant trading tech stack for DeFi agents, an agent-centric platform for optimizing and deploying financial strategies. It uses Monte Carlo simulation technologies to analyze market behaviour and optimize trading strategies.\n\nAiFi alliance — a collaboration of 11 teams building at the intersection of DeFi and AI. I find these consortiums very interesting, because this is one way you can start to set and define standards for a nascent industry.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThere’s a growing wave of Crypto AI teams developing frameworks that bridge the gap between off-chain and on-chain environments, enabling decentralized, multi-agent interactions.\n\nWayfinder — the “Google Maps” for on-chain agents, allowing them to navigate the blockchain to execute tasks. This is built by the Parallel team. You can stake PRIME tokens to earn PROMPT (future token for Wayfinder). Closed alpha is currently underway.\n\nTheoriq — this is the VC’s favourite bet on agent infrastructure, facilitating the coordination of collectives of AI agents. It allows users to build, deploy and earn via an AI agent marketplace.\n\nOlas (formerly Autonolas) — Building the multi-agent economy using open-source frameworks and tokeneconomic design. We wrote a deep dive on OLAS recently.\n\nConsumer-driven AI agents\n\nThis category is likely to take off the fastest—consumer-facing and entertainment-driven products are always easier to adopt, and there’s less risk if an agent goes rogue. In fact, a little bit of hallucination might even add to the fun, as we’ve seen with Truth Terminal.\n\nVirtuals — A pump.fun for AI agents, with a focus on gaming. Unlike teams rushing to capitalize on the agent trend with a launchpad they’re scrapped together in 2 weeks, Virtuals has been building its tech stack for over two years. Shoal research wrote a deep dive on them.\n\nCreator Bid — Create and tokenise AI influencers that can autonomously create and share social media content. I think we’ll soon see an AI agent KOL on Crypto Twitter with 1M+ followers\n\nThere’s also a wave of grassroots-level experimentation with AI agents as primitives. While many of these experiments are usually short-lasting, the insights they generate will serve as valuable lessons for future builders.\n\nTEE / tee_hee_hee was launched today by the co-founder of Nous Research as a truly free autonomous agent. Its Twitter credentials are locked inside a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which will only be released after seven days—ensuring that no human interference can affect the agent during that time.\n\nai16z is an investment fund launched on DAOs.fun and takes inputs from discord members on what tokens to buy and gives them trust scores based on their “alpha calls”\n\nAether is an AI agent on Farcaster that tips other users autonomously, promotes a token (HIGHER) and launched an NFT, and now has >$150K in its treasury.\n\nGaming is a perfect playground for AI agents. AI Arena/ARC taps into human players to train AI agents that replicate their in-game behaviours, leading to smarter AI opponents and improving player liquidity within games.\n\nI’m also keeping my eye on Coinbase’s newly launched template for creating AI agents with a crypto wallet that can perform simple on-chain transactions.\n\nParting Thoughts\n\nThe success of on-chain AI agents is tightly linked to AI’s overall progress. We’re still battling issues like multi-step reasoning and reducing hallucinations that trip up AI models. But as AI improves, so will the viability of these agents.\n\nThe good news is that Epoch AI believes AI scaling can continue for at least the next five years. Software is progressing at the fastest pace we’ve ever seen.\n\nThis means that the hurdles we’re facing today are just temporary roadblocks on the way to something much, much bigger.\n\nCrypto will be an inevitable part of this agentic future.\n\nOther notes that didn’t make it into the main article:\nCould prediction markets help AI agents make better decisions? Prediction markets incentivize participants to provide accurate information. AI agents tapping into these markets could benefit from real-time, incentive-aligned insights, reducing their reliance on potentially biased sources. Perhaps agents could even adopt Futarchy, as @mrink0 posits.\nAre we over-anthropomorphizing AI agents? Maybe we shouldn’t view them as doing “human” work. Focusing on functionality over human-like attributes can lead to more efficient and effective AI agents\nOn-chain data is a major PITA (pain in the ass) to work with and will continue to be a drag on on-chain AI agent development progress.\nThe real opportunity in agents isn’t in low-hanging fruit like customer service—which can easily be disrupted by next-gen AI models. Instead, the focus should be on highly regulated sectors where accuracy is critical, creating defensible moats around these models.\nGood readings on AI Agents\nDeAI IV: The Agentic Economy (Delphi Digital)\nOnchain AI Agents: Architecture, Examples, and Projects to Follow (Accelxr)\nThe internet of agents (Davide Crapis)\nAI Agents: A New Architecture for Enterprise Automation (Menlo Ventures)\nAgentic protocols (Alexander Good)\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nTeng Yan\n\nSpecial thanks to Graeme Barnes from Biconomy for reviewing my ideas and contributing his valuable thoughts to this piece.\n\nThis newsletter is intended solely for educational purposes and does not constitute financial advice.

    "section": "Sector Analysis",
    "full_content": "I often tell friends that in the future, we’ll look back on 2022–2024 as the pivotal years before humanity's massive technological acceleration.\n\nAI is likely to be the most transformative tech trend we’ll witness in our lifetimes—unless, of course, we stumble upon a miracle in life extension that allows us to live for hundreds of years.\n\nThis means AI is red-hot, and everyone is scrambling to get a slice of the action.\n\nIn just the first half of 2024, $35 billion has been funnelled into AI startups. And that’s only the private side—big tech is investing even more internally, as seen in their enormous GPU purchases from NVIDIA, which has driven NVDA’s market cap to an eye-popping $3 trillion.\n\nBut amid the hype, there’s a massive underdog opportunity that many are missing: Crypto AI (or decentralised AI)\n\nThis was a prescient comic from way back in 2019\n\nHistorically, every decade brings transformative investment opportunities that seem unpromising—even foolish—only to later prove visionary.\n\nSocial media was once dismissed as a frivolous distraction for teenagers with no real business model. Today, Meta (formerly Facebook) is one of the most powerful companies in the world, and early investors reaped returns exceeding 1,000 times their initial investment.\n\nThe narrative for Crypto AI is urgent and compelling. When I explain it, most people understand it right away.\n\nBy its nature, AI centralizes power. Left unchecked, it risks concentrating control in the hands of a few monopolistic organizations that will surely wield AI for profit and dominance. Decentralizing AI is not just crucial for our future—it’s essential for a brighter, more equitable society. I’ve explored this philosophical angle in greater depth before.\n\nSkeptics, though, argue that integrating crypto with AI is merely capitalizing on buzzwords, pointing to past disappointments in entertainment, gaming, and social media, where crypto has failed to achieve lasting impact or widespread adoption (yet). I hear this even from smart investors—and it’s a fair concern.\n\nBut I believe this time is actually different.\n\nThere are several reasons why Crypto AI is poised to follow a very different trajectory. And I’m writing this to explain why.\n\nThere’s much more to cover than I initially planned, so I’ve decided to break this into multiple parts.\n\nIn this three-part thesis, I’ll examine the technological & investment landscape for Crypto AI in depth. I’ll highlight the most promising sectors and show how I position myself to capitalize on this emerging megatrend.\n\nPart I: Why Crypto AI is the sector to pay attention to\n\nPart II: How I’m thinking about AI agents, decentralised training, verifiable inference, data networks (and other subsectors in Crypto AI)\n\nPart III: A multitude of different ways to capture value from this opportunity\n\nThe more AI the world has, the more crypto it will need to keep it at bay and put a price on – and defensive wall around – the most precious and irreplaceable resource of all: our time.\n\n- Preston Bryne\n\n‍\n\nBe Where Secular Technology Trends Intersect\n\nAs savvy investors and entrepreneurs, we always want to be riding the waves of change.\n\nTo catch the biggest waves, we need to look for places where multiple major currents converge and position ourselves there.\n\nThis means identifying secular technology trends—deep-rooted shifts in behaviour driven by technological advancements that redefine entire industries.\n\nCrypto is a secular technology trend representing a shift in how we think about and use money. Other examples include cloud computing, mobile technology, and clean energy.\n\nSimply riding a single secular tech trend isn’t enough, though. Thousands of others see the trend and are making similar bets. To truly stand out, we need to look beyond the obvious.\n\nThat’s why it’s remarkable to spot the early convergence of two large-scale secular technology trends.\n\nThis is where magic happens.\n\n‍\n\nConvergence + Scale = Opportunity\n(1) The Power of Convergence\n\nWhen two secular trends converge, a sweet spot for innovation and value creation is created — often in places others might overlook.\n\nMultiple Growth Drivers: Companies at the intersection of multiple secular trends benefit from the growth momentum of each trend.\nReduced Competition: Companies can carve out unique market positions with high barriers to entry because of the deep expertise required on both sides\nCross-pollination of ideas: Leads to innovative products and business models\n\n‍\n\n(2) The Power of Scale\n\nWhen it comes to investing, market size absolutely matters.\n\nConsider Amazon in the early 2000s. Its dominance was not just due to e-commerce but also because it tapped into the emerging cloud computing trend, birthing Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS now generates billions annually and is a leader in the growing cloud infrastructure market\n\nThe larger the secular technology trend—both in terms of the total addressable market and growth potential—and the earlier you enter, the greater the opportunities at its intersection.\n\nBig trends not only provide a buffer against failure but also significantly amplify potential rewards.\n\n‍\n\nCrypto 🤝 Artificial Intelligence\n\nCPUs and GPUs have long been the backbone of computing, but now they power AI, which is emerging as the world’s supercomputer—harnessing humanity’s collective knowledge and creativity.\n\nCrypto, on the other hand, enables the creation of open, decentralized networks, laying the foundation for a new internet.\n\nCombined, these super-computers and super-networks are a beautiful, powerful fit for each other.\n\nAI enhances the user experience of crypto. Users can interact with the blockchain using natural language instead of learning how to manage wallets, seed phrases, and sign transactions.\nCrypto provides the trustless, permissionless, and secure infrastructure AI needs to stay open and censorship-resistant. It also serves as a powerful coordination layer for building decentralized networks.\nThis convergence sets the stage for entirely new business models to emerge\n\nThe intersection of Crypto and AI will grow exponentially, benefiting from advancements in both fields, which are on separate development trajectories.\n\nThe key lies in identifying what crypto enables AI to achieve that was previously impossible — that’s the secret sauce. Hint: distributed training, data networks and private data. More on these in Part II.\n\n‍\n\nLearning from the Past: The Case of NFTs and DeFi\n\nFloor price of a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT. Yuga Labs raised $450M in funding in 2022. (Coingecko).\n\nThe rise and fall of NFTs offer a valuable lesson.\n\nNFTs rode high on a wave of speculation within the crypto community but lacked the tailwinds of another secular technology trend to take it further. Entertainment and gaming—the core use cases for NFTs—are complex, mature markets with heavy incumbents, and their dynamics are not driven by technology alone.\n\nAs a result, NFTs were unable to sustain their early momentum. While the use cases are real, achieving their promise will take much longer.\n\nOn the other hand, DeFi stands as a successful example of the power of intersecting secular tech trends.\n\nBy sitting at the crossroads of fintech and crypto, DeFi has revolutionized financial services, offering alternatives to traditional banking, lending, and asset management that address real-world financial needs. The total stablecoin market cap is at all-time highs ($170B) and rising, while $82B is locked in DeFi protocols today.\n\n‍\n\nTokens: Open Source AI Needs Crypto\nThe closed-door nature of Big Tech’s LLM precludes the possibility of an “AI Democracy,” where every developer or user should be able to contribute both algorithms and data to an LLM model, and in turn receive a fraction of the future profits from the model. AI should be accessible for, relevant to, and owned by everyone. \n\n‍- Catrina Wang (Portal Ventures)\n\nWhen people ask me why AI needs crypto, my answer is simple: tokens.\n\nTraditional software scales at nearly zero marginal cost. Write code once, deploy it everywhere.\n\nAI is an entirely different beast. It operates with high capital and marginal costs.\n\nTraining and deploying large-scale AI models demand vast computational resources, making efficiency and access to infrastructure critical success factors.\n\nRight now, we live in a world where centralized giants—OpenAI, Anthropic, Google—hold all the cards. These companies have the talent, the hardware, and the capital. But let’s be real: corporate-owned AI seeks to maximise profits. Always.\n\nMeta’s contributions to open-source AI have been invaluable, but who’s to say when they might stop releasing state-of-the-art models like Llama 3? Developing these systems costs hundreds of millions, and initiatives could be discontinued if Zuck wakes up on the wrong side of the bed one day.\n\nExpecting the open-source movement to compete with these giants purely out of ideals or goodwill is, frankly, unrealistic. We need a new strategy.\n\nThe thing is, there’s a ton of untapped compute, research, and talent in the open-source world, outside the top AI research labs. This includes contributions from universities, research centres, collaborative platforms like Hugging Face, and individual AI researchers. But right now, it’s fragmented. It lacks the coordination necessary to make major breakthroughs at scale.\n\nThat’s where tokens come in.\n\nAs outlined by @long_solitude from Zee Prime, tokens embody crypto’s most powerful property — permissionless capital formation.\n\nTokens do what traditional fundraising models can’t:\n\nThey create bottom-up funding opportunities for experimental AI projects that would never see the light of day under the VC model.\nThey bootstrap decentralized networks, turning them into thriving, self-sustaining ecosystems by distributing ownership and value to contributors. Just look at Bittensor as an early proof-of-concept.\nThey enable entirely new business models that slash costs, using DePIN-style tokenomics. One example: shifting upfront infrastructure costs (a huge burden for AI startups) to the network itself. Another: GPU marketplaces that tap into the latent global supply GPUs sitting unused in people’s homes, reducing costs per unit of compute.\n\nTokens unlock a massive opportunity for retail investors to ride the AI wave. And this is wildly understated.\n\nCrypto is great at finding new markets people want to trade in. Just look at NFTs & cultural assets, social tokens for the creator economy, memecoins for virality etc.\n\nMy bet? There’s a huge, untapped demand for retail participation in early-stage AI projects.\n\nAs AI seeps deeper into our daily lives and enables us to do things we couldn’t do before, people are starting to realize just how big and real this is. Sure, there will be heavy speculation, but it’s also about democratizing access to the biggest tech revolution of our lifetime—and giving everyone a shot at the next big thing.\n\nExpect things to get crazy.\n\n‍\n\nSo Why Now?\nSource: Syncracy Capital\n\n‍\n\nNew technologies tend to follow a well-defined innovation cycle.\n\nThe Gartner Hype Cycle is one of the best-known frameworks. It tracks how innovations blowoff through a hype phase, crash into the trough of disillusionment, and eventually climb up into real-world use cases.\n\nAs an investor, the ideal moments to invest are either when you spot a new innovation trigger early, well before the hype peak, or during the trough of disillusionment, when you can identify the startups poised to climb onto the slope of enlightenment.\n\nThis begs the million-dollar question: Where are we in this cycle for Crypto AI?\n\nI like to use the chart above from Syncracy Capital (smart folks) to highlight the consensus view today.\n\nIt suggests that decentralized AI is nearing or at the peak of inflated expectations. Crypto AI has had a strong year, with several protocols now at multibillion-dollar valuations.\n\nBut I disagree with this view. We’re probably nowhere near the peak for Crypto AI yet.\n\nThe consensus view underestimates the sheer scale of the opportunity ahead. We haven’t even hit mania territory. Ask around—how many people really understand Bittensor, the bellwether for Crypto AI? In fact, I believe it could be another 1–2 years before we see a true peak.\n\nHere’s why:\n\n1. Crypto AI tokens ($30B) represent just 2.9% of the total altcoin market cap ($1.04T).\n\nThe largest Crypto AI protocols with live tokens—TAO, NEAR, FET, and ICP—sit in the $5B–$10B market cap range, and there are only four of them.\n\nExcluding these four, and keeping in mind that ICP and NEAR aren’t exclusively Crypto AI tokens, the total market cap of Crypto AI stands at just $11.7B. That’s <25% of the market cap of memecoins.\n\nOnly four other Crypto AI projects (RENDER, GRT, AKT, AIOZ) are valued between $500M and $5B, with the majority having a market cap under $100 - 200M.\n\nThis is minuscule when you consider the massive potential of this trend convergence. Crypto AI encompasses both infrastructure and applications, including next-generation smart contract platforms designed for AI.\n\nBy comparison, smart contract platforms today have a combined market cap nearing $600B. There are 8 Layer 1 protocols valued over $10B, and another 12 in the $1B–$10B range.\n\nWhat could the market size for Crypto AI be? It’s such early days and anyone’s guess.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence estimates the generative AI market will grow at a CAGR of 30%+, reaching $1.3T by 2032. If decentralized AI captures just 10% of that broader AI market, and we apply a speculative premium common in crypto valuations (say 3X), the result is a $390B market in 2032—13X growth from today’s $30B.\n\nIntuitively, I think this is very conservative yet too far out into the future to be useful.\n\nAnother way is to consider Crypto AI growing to 10% of the total altcoin market cap in the next 3 years (2027) as AI apps and smart contract platforms launch and gain momentum. If the altcoin market cap hits $2.7T by then (50% growth from its 2021 peak of $1.8T), that would place Crypto AI at $270B—about 9X growth from current levels. That’s $240B in value waiting to be unlocked.\n\nBut these numbers are more illustrative than definitive. There are simply too many unknowns. What they do highlight, though, is the scale of the opportunity and provide us with a sanity check when thinking about valuations.\n\n‍\n\n‍2. Top-tier Crypto AI teams are just getting started‍\n\nMany high-calibre teams have been heads down building for 1–2 years and haven’t even launched their products to mainnet yet.\n\nSeveral have raised 8-figures in VC funding, including Sentient, Sahara, Vana, Story Protocol, Gensyn, Space and Time, Ritual, Nillion...\n\nOver the next 12 months, we’ll witness major mainnet rollouts and token launches—the AO Computer ecosystem, for example, is one to keep an eye on and which I wrote about earlier this year.‍\n\n‍\n\n3. AI is advancing exponentially.\n\nLook at OpenAI’s recent o1 model, which made significant leaps in reasoning capabilities. Scaling laws continue to hold. Crypto AI will closely track broader AI growth.\n\nThat said, there’s a lot of noise today. Perhaps more than any other crypto sector. Many startups and protocols will inevitably fail, even if they see some short-term success.\n\nA selective, discretionary approach to identifying winners will likely outperform a broad “spray-and-pray” strategy.\n\n‍\n\nPositive Catalysts Ahead for 2025\n\nI expect several major tailwinds for Crypto AI that will propel the sector and narrative in the coming year.\n\nTraditional Tech VC Funds Entering Crypto AI: While a16z is already in, major players like Sequoia, Lightspeed, and Accel have only dipped their toes lightly into this sector. As they move further along the investment curve towards decentralized AI, they’ll bring both capital and legitimacy to the space.\nOpenAI IPO: With OpenAI’s private valuation already at $150B and growing revenue, a potential IPO in 2025 could spark retail mania for AI investments. There are very few opportunities for retail investors to directly capture value from the AI trend outside of NVIDIA and hardware. This pent-up demand could spill over into Crypto AI tokens, which will be easily accessible on platforms like Coinbase.\nA More Token-Friendly US Government: If the next U.S. administration post-November 2024 elections takes a friendlier stance towards crypto tokens, it could provide massive tailwinds for the Crypto AI sector, opening up regulatory clarity and encouraging broader adoption\nBreakthroughs in AI: The exponential pace of AI development shows no signs of stopping anytime soon. In a recent blog post, Sam Altman outlines how he believes the future for AI is extremely bright. Progress in AI agents and distributed AI training will unlock new use cases and drive further momentum.\n\n‍\n\nThe Bear Case for Crypto AI\n\nWhile I’m bullish on the massive potential of Crypto AI, I also recognize that nothing is guaranteed. My thesis would shift if these bear case scenarios play out:\n\nUnfriendly Regulatory Regime: A hostile crypto regulatory environment in major markets like the U.S. could stifle innovation, limit funding, and push crypto projects into grey areas. Tokens are central to decentralized networks and heavy restrictions would undercut one of crypto’s key value drivers. This is less likely in a Trump win but could happen if Kamala becomes the US president.\nAI Fails to Live Up to the Hype: Despite the current frenzy and billions in investment, there’s a chance AI won’t deliver on its promise. If progress slows or hits roadblocks, we could see the AI bubble deflate. I think this is unlikely, though.\nFailure to Find Large Markets and Product-Market Fit (PMF): No matter how innovative, Crypto AI projects must find real business models and solid product-market fit. The sector could stagnate if decentralized AI fails to integrate meaningful commercial use cases. In this scenario, Crypto AI risks becoming more of a niche.\nMediocre Talent Pool: The pool of top machine learning scientists and engineers is limited. If Crypto AI can’t attract enough top talent who believe in the vision of an open, democratised AI future, innovation will slow, and the sector will struggle to keep up.\n\n‍\n\nPart I: Closing Thoughts\n\nUnironically, AI might be the best thing that’s ever happened to crypto.\n\nIt opens the door to true mainstream adoption and practical use cases—something that’s eluded gaming, NFTs, and social apps.\n\nWe’re heading into a decentralized AI future fueled by open, public networks. The savviest founders and forward-thinking investors are already taking notice.\n\nThe toughest part about Crypto AI is that you can't just watch the crypto space. Otherwise, you'll have a very narrow, superficial view of what’s coming. You need to stay plugged into machine learning developments, dig into the latest Arxiv papers, and talk to founders who truly believe they’re building the next big thing in AI.\n\nBut boy, I've never been so excited.\n\nIn Part II, I’ll dive into and map out the key subsectors within Crypto AI. Some of the most critical areas I’ve identified include:\n\nDecentralised Compute: Training, Inference & GPU marketplaces\nAI Agents living on-chain\nData networks\nCrypto AI consumer apps\nVerifiable AI, and more.\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan\n\n‍\n\nThis article is intended solely for educational purposes and does not constitute financial advice.

Gamers, whose GPUs are usually busy rendering epic tournaments in Call of Duty, are now lending their computing power to something even grander—an open-source AI model owned by everyone around the globe.\n\nIn this future, foundation-scale models are no longer the domain of the top AI labs only.\n\nEfficiency is King\n\nFor now, though, the lion’s share of heavy AI model training remains anchored in centralized data centres.\n\nCompanies like OpenAI are scaling up their massive clusters, and they’re not alone. Elon Musk recently announced that xAI is nearing completion of a data centre boasting the equivalent of 200,000 H100 GPUs. It’s aptly named “Colossus”.\n\nWhy is AI training still so centralized? It’s all about efficiency. Training large AI models relies on several key techniques:\n\n• Data parallelism: Splitting the dataset across multiple GPUs to perform the same operations in parallel, speeding up the training process.\n\n• Model parallelism: Dividing the model across multiple GPUs to get around memory constraints.\n\nThese methods require constant data exchange between GPUs, making interconnect speed critical.\n\nInterconnect speed = rate at which data is transferred between computers in the network\n\nWhen training runs cost $50M+, every ounce of efficiency matters.\n\nModel FLOPS utilization (MFU)—which measures how effectively a GPU’s maximum capacity is used—typically hovers around 35-40%. MFU was first introduced in Google’s PaLM paper back in 2022.\n\nSource: Google Cloud\n\n‍\n\nWhy so low? While GPU performance has skyrocketed, other essential components like networking, memory, and storage have only improved by 5-10x, creating bottlenecks. This leaves GPUs often sitting idle, waiting for data.\n\nWith their high-speed interconnects, centralised data centres can transfer data between GPUs far more efficiently, leading to significant cost savings.\n\nChallenges of Decentralised Training\n\nSo, one of the main challenges with decentralized AI training is low interconnect speed.\n\nSince GPU clusters aren’t physically in the same location, transferring data between them takes longer, leading to a bottleneck. Training requires GPUs to exchange data and sync at every step.\n\nThe farther apart the clusters are geographically, the higher the latency, slowing down the process and raising costs.\n\nThere are distributed training methods that allow the training of smaller models in low interconnect speed environments already. Frontier research is extending this to larger models now.\n\nFor example, Prime Intellect’s open DiCoLo paper demonstrates a practical approach where islands of GPUs perform 500 “local steps” before sharing and synchronising the results, resulting in up to 500x lower bandwidth requirements. They’ve extended this to work in a 1.1B parameter model.\n\nIntroducing OpenDiLoCo, an open-source implementation and scaling of DeepMind’s Distributed Low-Communication (DiLoCo) method, enabling globally distributed AI model training. — Prime Intellect (@PrimeIntellect)\n4:55 PM • Jul 11, 2024\n\nNous Research’s DisTrO offers another promising solution with 1000x reduction in bandwidth requirements in training a 1.2B parameter model.\n\nWhat if you could use all the computing power in the world to train a shared, open source AI model?

Techniques like model parallelism (splitting model layers across devices) can help make this feasible.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead\n\nThere are even bigger ideas on the horizon.\n\nPluralis suggests that decentralized networks could aggregate more GPU compute power than centralized data centres ever could—even the largest data centres are limited by physical space constraints, power, and cooling.\n\nThis means the world's most powerful AI models will be trained in a decentralised fashion.\n\nIt’s an exciting thought, but I’m not fully sold on this vision just yet. I need to see better evidence that decentralised training of the largest AI models is technically and economically feasible.\n\nThere are already specific use cases for decentralised AI training, such as training mid-sized models or certain types of models whose architecture makes decentralised training most suitable.\n\nWhy Crypto?\n\nLarge global networks of nodes (computers) are essential to realize the vision of decentralized training and inference.\n\nAnd the best way to build decentralised networks? Crypto, by far.\n\nOnce decentralized training becomes practically feasible, tokens will be the key to scaling these networks and rewarding contributors.\n\nTokens align the interests of participants, uniting them around a shared goal: growing the network and increasing the token’s value. A well-designed token economy creates a powerful incentive structure, helping overcome the early challenges that typically stall growing networks.\n\nJust look at Bitcoin and Ethereum—they’ve already aggregated the largest supply of computing power globally, proving the power of token-driven networks.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts—whether you agree or see things differently.

    "full_content": "GM\n\nBig money is flooding into AI. Europe just launched the €200B InvestAI program, building on the European AI Champions Initiative.\n\nThe AI race is just beginning.\n\nBuilding on the European AI Champions initiative, I’m glad to announce InvestAI 🇪🇺\n\nWe aim to mobilise €200 billion in AI investments in Europe ↓\n\n— Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen)\n9:57 AM • Feb 11, 2025\n\nAnd Sam Altman (OpenAI) is out here talking about the $500 billion Stargate project, and plans to raise $5 trillion in a few years. Crazy? Maybe. But seriously… how do you even price intelligence?\n\nThe big question is: how much of that $$$ flows into Crypto AI?\n\nInfrastructure is improving fast. Projects like Story Protocol and Nillion (mainnet soon) are giving agents tools to protect IP and stay private in a decentralized world. But the truly useful applications? Still lagging. We’ve got launchpads and agents dropping left and right, but too often, it’s a flood of “agent slop” with little real utility.\n\nAnd therein lies the massive opportunity. The gap between infrastructure and real utility is wide open. Founders who focus on building apps and agents that actually solve problems will own the future.\n\nQuick tips for founders pitching for funds: 1. Skip the buzzwords (DEFAI??), and 2. Get straight to why what you’re building is actually awesome and important.\n\nGood luck!\n\nIn this edition of our weekly AI Edge, we cover:\n\nThe launch of Arc Forge\nStory Protocol hits mainnet\nCookie Fun drops Act Two of Cookie DAO\n\nSome serious action in the AI coin market this week.\n\nARC absolutely popped, soaring by 84%, and it’s no surprise with everyone talking about the Arc Forge launchpad (more on that in a sec). Meanwhile, AI16Z and AVA held their own, up 57% and 49% respectively as AI agent tokens make a strong comeback.\n\nBut it wasn’t all green candles. NEUR and MOSS took a hit, sliding 37% and 26%, respectively. This is despite NEUR pushing a new update to better look at bundled transactions and snipers.\n\nZooming out from Crypto AI, AI startups pulled in a record $110 billion in funding in 2024—a 62% jump from the previous year, according to Dealroom. In contrast, the broader tech sector raised $227 billion, down 12% from 2023.\n\nSource: dealroom.co\n\nThe recent downtrend in Crypto AI feels a lot like the Solana saga of 2022—remember when everyone wrote it off? Meanwhile, devs kept building, fundamentals kept improving, and the early quitters quietly disappeared. Fast forward, and it became one big “I told you so” for those who stuck it out.\n\nTime will tell.\n\nArc Forge: Redefining AI Token Launches\nSource: cookie.fun\n\n‍\n\nArc Forge is here, driving a serious uptick in the ARC’s mindshare. In just a week, ARC’s slice of the Crypto AI mindshare jumped from 1.8% to 3.5%. Not bad, right?\n\nArc Forge is a token launch platform built on Meteora’s Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLMM), integrated with Jupiter routing.\n\nTranslation: Deeper liquidity, sniper deterrence, and a boost to the ARC ecosystem. Let’s break it down.\n\nFirst up, liquidity. Arc Forge is about reducing slippage and volatile price swings. How? Meteora’s \"price bins\" system. This allows projects to do more with less capital—whether you're a creator or a trader, that’s a win.\n\nThe cherry on top? Similar to Virtuals, every trade on Arc Forge goes through ARC, creating real demand and fees that go right back into the ecosystem. That’s how you make a crypto ecosystem work for you.\n\nSource: Arc Twitter\n\n‍\n\nThe first project to launch on Arc Forge? AskJimmy, created by Columbia University quants and a hedge fund veteran with experience managing $1B+ AUM. They’re bringing pro-level trading strategies to the table, covering Spot, Perps, and Options across platforms like Hyperliquid and Uniswap.\n\nAnd for those who want the easy life, AskJimmy Vaults offer fully automated trading—just set it and forget it.\n\nBut of course, it hasn’t been all smooth sailing. The token launch hit a bit of a bump, with the team reportedly pulling $700K from the Meteora Pool by removing ASKJ and USDC. And despite Arc Forge claiming to have multiple anti-snipe measures, snipers were still able to get in on the launch. This all may have contributed to a 25% dip in ARC’s price. Ouch.\n\nThe Arc and AskJimmy teams are at least owning up to the fact that this launch was far from perfect—and that’s a start. They know improvements need to be made.\n\nGM\nCommunity Update: We are currently digesting everything and looking to establish a detailed report on what happened with the arc-team. \nIt's important return to our ethos : we are first in or we are never in. We will stay the first token from the rig complex. \n\nSniper… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n‍— AskJimmy (@askjimmy_ai)\n9:12 PM • Feb 13, 2025\n\nHere’s hoping teams like ElizaOS take notes and roll out something polished when they drop their launchpads. No one wants a repeat of this mess.\n\n🌴 Story Protocol: Tokenizing Intellectual Property\n\nStory’s public mainnet is officially live, and it’s ready to flip the script on how we think about intellectual property (IP) in the AI age — a $61 trillion global market.\n\nIts Layer 1 blockchain transforms IP into a programmable asset class, enabling permissionless ownership, exchange, and monetization.\n\nHomer, our Public Mainnet, is live.\n\nWelcome to a new era of ꧁IP꧂\n\nLearn more ↴\n\n— Story (꧁IP꧂) (@StoryProtocol)\n8:21 AM • Feb 13, 2025\n\nAt the heart of it all is the IP token (currently trading at a $1.8B FDV), which plays a critical role in governance, staking, and, of course, gas fees. It’s also got a deflationary burn mechanism. With 58.4% of the token supply going to the ecosystem, community, and incentives, the protocol is gearing up for decentralization and long-term growth—if everything goes according to plan.\n\nIP Finance (IPFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization could be a game-changer for creators—artists, developers, and scientists alike—enabling them to upload IP, set terms, and automatically earn royalties.\n\nThe platform’s focus on fair launch principles and sniper-prevention mechanisms ensures a level playing field. Staking rewards are launching simultaneously for all participants, with long lock-up periods for early backers who supported the project at its inception.\n\nTo kick things off, Story is launching a 30-day Day 1 Rewards Portal to incentivize early adopters. They’re also making strategic moves, including a collaboration with ElizaOS, which will allow Eliza agents to access and monetize programmable IP on Story’s platform.\n\nWill Story truly transform the IP landscape?\n\nSuccess is going to come down to one thing—adoption. Convincing creators, developers, and AI companies to embrace an entirely new IP system is no small task. This is a huge shift, and the jury’s still out on whether the market is ready for it.\n\n‍\n\nProject Updates\nDynamic TAO is live!

The first EAO? AskBillyBets, an autonomous sports betting agent set to launch on Solana.\nWeb2 AI\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman turned down Elon Musk's jaw-dropping $97.4 billion offer to take control of the company. Altman’s take? Musk was just trying to edge out OpenAI in the AI race, not genuinely back the mission. So, while OpenAI gears up for a potential $300 billion funding round, Musk keeps pushing forward with his own AI firm, xAI.\nAnthropic has dropped the Anthropic Economic Index, which tracks the economic impact of AI by analyzing millions of anonymized Claude conversations. This data is gold for anyone looking to understand AI’s growing role in the economy.\nZyphra just launched Zonos, a next-gen TTS model that delivers ultra-high-fidelity voice cloning with precise control over vocal speed, emotion, and tone.

    "full_content": "GM!\n\nNot the smoothest start to the month—markets took a nosedive over the weekend, rattled by Trump’s tariff announcement.

Imagine using a decentralised network of nodes to generate synthetic data for model distillation.\n\nThat’s the kind of innovation that keeps us excited for the future.\n\n---\n\n🚨 One quick announcement before we dive in..\n\nAI moves so fast and keeping up is tough. We struggle too. So we’ve just launched a Telegram channel for Cyra, our AI researcher, to share her key insights in a timely way. She filters the most important news, tracks high-signal discussions across communities on a daily basis.\n\nIt’s broadcast-only, so no spam—just pure signal. Join us here:\n\n‍https://t.me/cyra_alpha\n\n---\n\nIn this edition of our weekly AI Edge, we cover:\n\nElizaOS GitHub showdown & latest updates\nDynamic TAO anticipation builds\nAutonolas unveils three major updates, including an \"Agent App Store\"\n\nBrutal week in the markets—ETH nuked 25% in a day, crashing below the $3K support.\n\nAI tokens got wrecked, too. FARTCOIN and AI16Z plunged 63% and 57%, so hard that even FARTCOIN maxi Taiki rage-quit his position.\n\nMeanwhile, FXN took the worst hit, tanking 65% despite its recent mainnet launch.\n\nBut it wasn’t all doom and gloom. SNAI (Swarmnode) and NEUR managed to defy the bloodbath. SNAI ripped 48%—likely fueled by its acceptance into the NVIDIA Inception Program.\n\nSource: kaito.ai\n\n‍\n\nOverall, AI’s mindshare has collapsed to 32%, down from 70% last month.\n\nLooks like traders are shifting focus to DeFi, with the Berachain launch. Will AI agents carve out a role in the Berachain ecosystem?\n\nEliza's GitHub Showdown\nSource: star-history.com\n\n‍\n\nEliza just hit a major milestone, catching up to Solana Foundation's GitHub star count in a photo finish. That’s right, Eliza is giving Solana a run for its money, and the numbers don’t lie. Here’s the breakdown:\n\n@elizaOS:\n\nStars: 14k\nForks: 4.2k\nContributors: 526\n\n@solanalabs:\n\nStars: 13.8k\nForks: 4.6k\nContributors: 489\n\nBut Eliza is not just about GitHub stars. Their recent v0.1.9 release is packed with upgrades: Instagram and XMTP clients, enhanced autonomous agents, and expanded support for NVIDIA, Livepeer, and Amazon Bedrock. Blockchain integrations? They’ve got Birdeye, Solana improvements, OpenZeppelin governance, cross-chain swaps, and new chains like BNB, Cronos, and Mina.\n\nOh, and over 100 new developers joined the party..\n\nMeanwhile, the DAO is attempting to revamp its tokenomics. This is mission critical, considering how the price of AI16Z has been tanking lately. Instead of letting its $15M-$30M treasury sit idle, it’s deploying those assets into liquidity pools. By pairing tribute tokens with the AI16Z token in one-sided LPs, it aims to create buy pressure and improve liquidity.\n\nAnd more partnerships? Yes\n\nAlphanomics: Future Eliza agents will integrate with Alphanomics’ On-Chain Super Terminal, giving users real-time data analysis.\nTON: A $20K prize pool for developers building the TON Plugin for Eliza.\nAnkr: Connect AI agents to Ankr’s global node network for fast, reliable data streams.\nRena AI: improving Eliza’s trading with advanced price prediction and automated execution.\n\nOne more thing: the DAO is launching a Crypto Shark Tank with AI judges. Users pitch their ideas, an “AI Writers Room” generates a full episode script in seconds, and projects get exposure, feedback, and funding opportunities. It’s currently built on PlayCanvas, with potential for Unity or Unreal integration in the future.\n\n🌴 The Rise of Dynamic TAO (dTAO)\n\nBittensor is about to shake things up with the launch of dynamic TAO. With Coinbase adding TAO to their roadmap and the dTAO whitepaper released, the stage is set for something big.\n\nThe countdown has begun: a senate vote kicks off the process, and if all goes well by February 9th, dynamic TAO (dTAO) will make its grand debut between February 10th and 14th. It’s going to be a big week.\n\nBittensor dTAO is dropping in mid-February.\n\nHuge congratulations to @const_reborn and team @opentensor — we @latentholdings are also very proud to play a role in shipping this for everyone. 🤝🔥🌊\n\n— JJ (@JosephJacks_)\n5:35 PM • Jan 25, 2025\n\nBut what makes dTAO a game-changer? Let’s break it down.\n\nDynamic TAO (dTAO) is a massive upgrade to the Bittensor network, set to transform how token emissions are distributed.\n\nRight now, a small group of validators manually assess subnets, deciding their value and rewards. But as the network scales, this system is cracking—validators are overloaded, engagement drops, and manipulation risks rise. So high-value subnets might get overlooked while less deserving ones reap the rewards.\n\ndTAO introduces subnet tokens (think Alpha1, Alpha2, Alpha3) and subnet pools powered by Constant Product Automated Market Makers (AMMs). These pools let users stake TAO for subnet tokens and vice versa, with prices determined by market activity.\n\nIn other words, the market decides what each subnet is worth.\n\nSource: bittensor.com\n\n‍\n\nThe dTAO system has powerful features: AMMs for subnet pools, fresh liquidity injections, TAO staking/unstaking, dynamic emission distribution, and halving schedules.\n\nEach subnet gets its own liquidity pool, allowing true price discovery between subnet tokens.\n\nWith dTAO, subnet valuations are no longer dictated by a select few but by the collective intelligence of the market. This upgrade cements Bittensor’s vision: a decentralized network where growth is driven by the community, for the community.\n\nProject Updates\nAutonolas has launched Olas Pearl, a desktop \"agent app store\" that simplifies the deployment and management of autonomous AI agents across DeFi, influencer marketing, and prediction markets. Users can earn OLAS by running agents and staking tokens. Olas recently raised a $13.8M funding round and launched a $1M accelerator program.\nMira Network announces Magnum Opus, a $10M builder grant program to accelerate AI innovation. The program offers retroactive grants, mentorship, technical support, and strategic distribution to empower builders.\nNillion partners with Io.net to enable private AI inference at scale, leveraging a global GPU network while keeping data and model parameters secure.\n0G Foundation unveils an $88.88M Ecosystem Growth Program to accelerate AI as a public good on the largest L1 for AI.\nWorldcoin introduces Anonymized Multi-Party Computation (AMPC), an open-source, quantum-secure privacy solution designed for the AI era, ensuring robust protection for users and AI agents.\nThe winners of the Coinbase CDP AI Hackathon were announced, featuring DeFi agents, social media agents, educational agents, and a proof-of-authenticity initiative built on Bittensor.\nGaia Network introduces the Gaia XP Program, rewarding community contributions with Gaia points, which can be redeemed for Gaia credits to interact with Gaia AI Agents, fostering a thriving decentralized AI ecosystem.\nSapiens, a decentralised data foundry for AI, releases its litepaper\nAI Agents\nAcolyt launches the Signal framework, an open-source system to help AI agents achieve clear goals, like increasing mindshare on X\nWarden Protocol introduces the Warden Agent Kit, empowering developers to create on-chain AI agents that trigger smart contracts using AI outputs, combining off-chain processing with on-chain execution for DeFi automation.\nSoleng, a Web3 solutions engineering and DevRel agent, is now powered by Hyperbolic’s decentralized compute framework, automating and enhancing developer relations.\nAiccelerate DAO partners with Virtuals as a founding Venture Partner, offering $50K grants to selected projects in exchange for token shares, advancing a multi-ecosystem AI future.\nSwarmNode joins the NVIDIA Inception Program, gaining access to new technical tools, resources, and investor networks.\nWeb2 AI\nOpenAI continues to push boundaries with the launch of o3-mini, now integrated into ChatGPT and the API, offering enhanced capabilities for developers and users alike. Meanwhile, their Deep Research feature enables ChatGPT to analyze and compile comprehensive reports from hundreds of sources in minutes—a task that would take humans hours.\nGoogle DeepMind has made Gemini 2.0 Flash generally available, positioning it as the go-to model for high-frequency, high-volume tasks at scale. Its efficiency makes it a powerhouse for developers tackling demanding workloads.\nAnthropic introduces Constitutional Classifiers, a breakthrough in AI safety that reduces jailbreaks by 95% while maintaining minimal impact on refusals. Leveraging synthetic data and principle-based rules, it adapts dynamically to emerging threats.\nByteDance, the company behind TikTok, unveils OmniHuman-1, a cutting-edge AI model capable of generating hyper-realistic videos from just a single image and audio track, opening new possibilities in content creation. It’s mindblowing.\n\nEarlier this week, we dropped an essay on Freysa, one of the few AI agent projects that really caught our eye in a noisy space. She’s a new breed of AI agents, known as Sovereign AIs. Read it here 👇\n\nFreysa: The AI That Owns Itself\n\nCan we build Sovereign AI agents worthy of our trust?

    "full_content": "GM!\n\nHappy Lunar New Year! Wishing you prosperity, good health, and maybe even some green candles.\n\nBut while the festivities are in full swing, the markets clearly didn’t get the memo.\n\nThe launch of DeepSeek triggered a mass sell-off across US tech equities and AI-related stocks—and the hot takes have been flying.\n\nMost of them? Pretty bad. But one of the more thoughtful takes came from Dario, CEO of Anthropic:\n\n“..DeepSeek V3 is not a unique breakthrough or something that fundamentally changes the economics of LLMs; it’s an expected point on an ongoing cost reduction curve. What’s different this time is that the company that was first to demonstrate the expected cost reductions was Chinese.”\n\nCheaper, better, faster AI is always a win in our book.\n\nIn this edition of our weekly AI Edge, we cover:\n\nNous Psyche, the latest from Nous Research\nThe controversy around VVV\nDeepSeek, a huge deflationary shock to the price of intelligence\n\nAnother brutal week in the market. The launch of DeepSeek, combined with weak sentiment across sectors, brought even more pain.\n\nAgent-related tokens got wrecked—MOSS, NOVA, and ELIZA all plunged 50% this week alone. Even major AI names like VIRTUAL, FARTCOIN, AI16Z, and AIXBT weren’t spared, each dropping 20-30%. Right now, buying into agents feels like catching a falling knife.\n\nOn the flip side, MOR and TAO stood strong. Morpheus kept up last week’s momentum, pumping another 50%, likely fueled by VVV’s launch due to their partnership. Meanwhile, TAO is finally getting some love. With more chatter around the upcoming dTAO upgrade, it looks like everyone is waking up to the fact that TAO has been overlooked for too long.\n\nVVV Airdrop Controversy\n\nVenice dropped its VVV token out of nowhere, and yeah—it made waves.Venice is a chatGPT-like app that runs on open-source models like Deepseek and Llama, but everything stays in your browser with prompts routed through their proxy infrastructure to a set of decentralized GPU providers.Venice went all-in on its community, airdropping half the total supply straight to Venice users and Base token holders (VIRTUAL, AERO, DEGEN, etc.). And the numbers? Wild.\n\n10M out of 25M tokens have already been claimed\n124 accounts scored 5,000–10,000 VVV each ($40K–$80K).\n287 accounts walked away with 10,000+ VVV (over $80K).\n\nBut then came the dump. Since launch on Jan 27, the market cap cratered from $680M to $170M—a brutal 60-70% correction. Coinbase listing VVV within one day didn’t help either.The data tells an interesting story. On Jan 28, there was a 20K jump in holders, likely due to the 24H airdrop unlock rule. Regular Venice users had their tokens locked for 24H and had to upgrade to Pro to claim. Meanwhile, Base ecosystem holders and others with unlocked tokens could sell immediately. When those tokens hit the market, well… you can guess what happened next.\n\nThis TGE was messy. Some were thrilled with free money for holding Crypto AI tokens, while Venice users felt rugged by the lock-up period.And it wasn’t just the tokenomics causing a stir. Concerns popped up over Venice sending inference requests in plain text, raising questions about GPU providers seeing user prompts. Then there was the insider trading scandal, with two Aerodrome contributors suspended and Venice team members dumping ~1% of the supply on day one. Not a good look, in our opinion.Airdrop mania, a controversial launch, and privacy concerns. Plenty of drama for a week.\n\n🌴 The Mortal who became a Goddess\n\nNous Research just dropped Nous Psyche, and it’s a big one.\n\nThis new infrastructure aims to decentralize and democratize AI development, making training and inference accessible to the community.\n\nBuilt on Solana, Phase 1 of Psyche is all about cooperative training for generative AI—pulling together a mix of GPUs, from gaming rigs (4090s) to data centre powerhouses (A100s, H100s), to train AI models at scale. It builds on Nous’ previous work with Nous DisTrO, which trained a 15B parameter model across multiple locations in the U.S. and Europe last year—setting a record for fastest convergence in distributed training, all without high-speed interconnect hardware.\n\nPhase 2 is where things get even more interesting—Psyche moves beyond just training and into reasoning and reinforcement learning. Think Deepseek R1, but trained on a decentralized network that allows for accessible inference and higher-order thinking models‍\n\nFun fact: The project is named after Psyche from Greek mythology - a mortal who became a goddess through sheer determination. Good omen?\n\nThe endgame? Open, decentralized infrastructure for training superintelligence. A pretty wild vision.\n\nNous hasn’t officially announced a token, but all signs point to it. A well-designed token could coordinate resources, align incentives, and drive adoption—exactly what Psyche needs to scale.\n\nNous is already crushing it with their Hermes LLM Series. Hermes 3 is the brain behind tons of social agents on X, Telegram, and Discord. And they're not stopping there - the plan is to make it even smarter through Psyche's reinforcement learning system.For months, Crypto AI has been obsessed with AI Agents. But distributed training has always been one of the most exciting use cases for Crypto AI, and Nous Psyche just put it back in the spotlight.\n\nFunding Raises\nPippin Founder Yohei Nakajima launches Agent Fund, a VC fund for AI agent apps, infra, and tools. Led by Yohei, Alex Reibman, and Adam Silverman, it’s open for investors on a rolling basis. Equity fund, not token-based.\nProject Updates\nStory Protocol announces Emergenceverse, a franchise with a storyline created by David Goyer. David Goyer is the mastermind behind the Dark Knight trilogy and Blade. AI agents and users will build the next major franchise on-chain.\nNillion network hosts the new DeepSeek R1-14B model privately using TEEs inside nilAI. Users can now access DeepSeek while ensuring their interaction is completely private. Nillion Network is building a privacy-focused network for AI.\nHyperbolic partners with Nexus to provide GPUs for powering Nexus's ZK technology. Hyperbolic’s Eliza plugin is also live, allowing Eliza agents to autonomously use Hyperbolic GPUs\nNesa announces a fully encrypted inference API. Equivariant Encryption (EE) is an adaption of Homomorphic encryption that works on various models to provide end to end privacy on data manipulation but with zero latency.\nPrime Intellect releases TOPLOC, a locality-sensitive hashing scheme for verifiable inference. It detects modifications to models, prompts, or precision and is robust across various GPU types. Prime Intellect is building the foundation for decentralized, verifiable compute protocols.\nGiza crosses 11.5K autonomous transactions through ARMA, its automated on-chain yield optimizer bot. Users can deposit stablecoins for ARMA to find and optimize the best yields across multiple chains.\nthirdweb, a full stack Web3 development platform, introduces Nebula for Unity, allowing game devs to build agents that talk to players and interact on-chain\nIncentive Programs / Rewards\nPrivasea AI’s testnet part 2 has arrived. Users can provide processing power for secure AI computations and earn rewards, including token incentives. Privasea is building an encrypted AI network enabled by FHE.\nAI Agents\nVirtuals is expanding to Solana, introducing a Meteora Pool, a Strategic SOL Reserve, and maintaining the AGENT/VIRTUAL trading pair. The expansion includes a Venture Partner Model with grants, an AI Hackathon, and collaboration with key partners like Jupiter Exchange and LayerZero. Virtuals also offers grants of 42K VIRTUALS tokens for aspiring projects.\nYoumio partners with Virtuals to bring agents to life in 3D worlds. Virtual agents can now be brought into 3D worlds powered by Unreal Engine, opening up new possibilities and environments for these agents.\nChromia rolls out EVAL, an agent that evaluates other AI agents. Built on the Chromia engine and Virtuals ecosystem, EVAL scores AI outputs on truth, accuracy, creativity, and engagement. AIXBT received a score of 80/100.\nDrift integrates with the Solana Agent Kit, enabling agents to trade perps, borrow/lend assets, and interact with Vaults. Drift is the home of on chain trading on Solana.\n0G Labs releases their ERC-7857 standard. This standard is built explicitly for AI agents and enables the representation of AI agents as NFTs. This new standard includes privacy-preserving metadata where AI “intelligence” stays encrypted and secure.\nOLAS announced Modius, an advanced DeFAI agent. Modius autonomously manages crypto assets with intelligent rebalancing and lending strategies.\nTHINK agents drops their whitepaper for their Agent Standard. The THINK Agent Standard creates the foundation for intelligent on-chain agents, making them composable and interoperable.\nai16zdao rebrands as ElizaOS after a request from the VC firm a16z. The $ai16z ticker will remain.\nBittensor\n\nThe dTAO upgrade for Bittensor is set to drop in mid-February, so expect a surge in attention.\n\nMode launches Synth 'subnet' on Bittensor to build decentralized AI that predicts crypto prices (subnet 50).\nCrucible Lab’s State of Bittensor 2024 report is out. It’s a great read.\n\nWe dropped a new deep dive this week—now shifting gears from AI agents to the infrastructure powering them. Atoma Network is building the most trustable compute network on the planet 👇\n\nAtoma Network: Private & Verifiable AI  Building the most trustable compute network on the planet\n\n🔥\n\n On X..DeepSeek = Bullish for Crypto AI?\n\nDeepSeek is extremely bullish for crypto x AI. > An open source model with better performance than Open AI's model built at a fraction of the price--and they did it with inferior hardware.> All the major crypto x AI frameworks can easily use open source models or build on top…\nx.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— Mark (@markus9x)\n5:24 AM • Jan 27, 2025\n\nDeepSeek is a huge deflationary shock to the price of intelligence\n\nDeepSeek's new R1 reasoning model is dragging down the NASDAQ.

    "full_content": "GM\n\nBig moves in AI this week. A consortium of major tech companies has just announced plans to pour a staggering $500B into building new AI infrastructure in the U.S.\n\nIs this real, or is it just positioning?\n\nStargate is a great name but the $500b is a ridiculous number and no one should take it seriously unless SoftBank is going to sell all of their BABA and ARM.\nSoftBank has $38b in cash, $142b in debt and generates $3ish billion in FCF per BBG.  They own $143b in ARM and $18b in… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— Gavin Baker (@GavinSBaker)\n3:03 PM • Jan 22, 2025\n\nWhatever the case, It’s starting to feel like we’re approaching the “golden era of AI” trifecta:\n\nCapital flowing into AI is endless\nThe TAM for intelligence is limitless\nThe demand for compute is insatiable\n\nOf course, nothing is ever infinite. And we could very well be in the middle of the largest tech bubble of all.\n\nBut it’s hard to find a reason not to be bullish on AI right now. Even some crypto firms we know are pivoting their focus to ride this AI wave.\n\nIn this edition of our weekly AI Edge, we cover:\n\nCreator Bid’s ecosystem growth\nDeFi agents are truly here\nCool stuff we’ve been cooking up in our discord\n\n🦄 ALERT: We’re looking for a writer/researcher to join our team! If you’re deep into Crypto AI and AI agents, live on X (chronically, of course), and can write like an absolute beast, we want to hear from you. Please fill in this form here.\n\nAnd if you’re a budding analyst and prefer to write on your own time, our Research Fellowships might be suitable for you.\n\nIt’s been a rollercoaster of a week in the market. The launch of the TRUMP memecoin over the weekend caused absolute chaos, sucking liquidity out of nearly every corner of the market.\n\nThe carnage was real. Most Crypto AI tokens took a 20-30% hit, with some of the big names dropping even harder. ZEREBRO and GAME? Absolutely wrecked—both tanked over 40%.\n\nBut there’s hope. Liquidity is starting to creep back into the AI narrative, sparked by news of the Trump administration's big push toward AI innovation.\n\nThe top AI memecoin, FARTCOIN, is back in the green—though it’s still off its weekly highs. The dip came after Andy revealed that at his direction, Truth Terminal offloaded a big chunk of its FARTCOIN stash to an anonymous buyer in an OTC deal.\n\nThe irony here is that it’s the humans that profit from AI.\n\nCreator Bid’s Ecosystem Growth\nSource: @petertherock\n\n‍\n\nCreator Bid’s BID token has finally landed after months of anticipation, debuting with a $150M fully diluted valuation. Built initially on Base, the team isn’t slowing down—they’re expanding to BNB Chain through a strategic partnership with Binance. Big moves.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the engine behind this ecosystem: the agents.

Your very own DeFi portfolio manager, but with laser precision and zero human error.\n\nHere’s how it works: the agent is tied to a Safe smart account, so while it actively manages your Morpho vault positions, your funds stay 100% under your control via your wallet.\n\nThe agent constantly scans yield opportunities across Morpho vaults and executes rebalances at intervals you choose—weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. Each rebalance checks your current positions against what’s out there, making sure you’re squeezing every last drop of yield while respecting the rules you set.\n\nThrough a conversational interface, you can adjust:\n\nAPY thresholds\nRebalancing frequency\nTrusted vault curators\nLiquidity requirements\nMarket preferences\nYour @MorphoLabs yield runs on AI autopilot, so you earn more, effortlessly, 24/7 🦋\nPowered by ConsoleKit and built on @base, your personal agent automatically rebalances and reallocates to secure the highest APY with minimal input.\n- Deploy an agent that monitors and… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n‍— Brahma (@BrahmaFi)\n4:37 PM • Jan 23, 2025\n\nThe agent runs on Brahma’s ConsoleKit, a new framework that connects AI decision-making with on-chain execution. Why does that matter? Because until now, AI could tell you what to do in DeFi but not do it for you. \n\nConsoleKit’s “Brain” is the magic sauce here—transforming AI-driven strategies into real, on-chain transactions.

    "full_content": "GM {{ First Name | }}!\n\nThe intersection of crypto and AI seems to be tokens that shill themselves.\n\n— Naval (@naval)\n12:49 AM • Jan 16, 2025\n\nSpicy take. And it hits a nerve because he’s not wrong.\n\nMost AI people think of crypto AI agents as Twitter bots with a token attached. Even aixbt, the darling of the agent space and riding a cool $800M market cap, is nothing more than a glorified alpha hunting bot.\n\nBut Naval’s take feels too anchored in the now. He’s discounting how the future is going to be. There is something fundamentally important about decentralisation in AI as a safeguard against monopolies or misuse.\n\nAnd that’s why we’re all here… right?\n\nIn this edition of our weekly AI Edge, we cover:\n\nVirtuals does a mega buyback of agent tokens\n\nSpheron’s truly autonomous agents\n\nAgent frameworks continue to jostle, with no first-mover advantage\n\nThe market’s been a bit weird. Bitcoin is back about $100K. Yet the timeline feels eerily quiet, and altcoins are barely moving.\n\nIf there’s a sign that memes are still holding people’s attention, this is it. FARTCOIN hits another all-time high, rising 75% on the week.  Meanwhile, AIXBT is climbing after Andrew Kang’s “tokenized alpha” thesis dropped.\n\nIt’s been a mixed bag for AI agents. SWARMS and NEUR (part of the newly-coined DeFAI category) are down big this week. It feels like we’ve hit a saturation point with AI agents. Liquidity is stretched with so many new tokens launching each week, and capital keeps rotating fast.\n\nStay safe my friends.\n\nVirtuals Ecosystem Stimulus\n\nThis week Virtuals Protocol announced a massive ecosystem update, revealing a ~$40M buyback program funded from their post-bonding trading revenue.\n\nSince October 2024, Virtual has accumulated 12,990,427.85 VIRTUAL, which will be used to buy and burn top agent tokens from their ecosystem.\n\nThe buyback allocation is strategically weighted by each token's trading activity, rewarding projects that contribute most actively to Virtual's ecosystem volume with larger proportional distributions.\n\nThe top 5 VIRTUAL allocations are:\n\nGAME: ~1.6M VIRTUAL ($5.6M USD)\n\nCONVO: ~1.1M VIRTUAL ($3.8M USD)\n\nAIXBT: ~881K VIRTUAL ($3M USD)\n\nSEKOIA: ~712K VIRTUAL ($2.5M USD)\n\nMISATO: ~690K VIRTUAL ($2.4M USD)\n\nSince the buyback announcement, some of these low-liquidity tokens have shot through the roof.\n\n🌴 Skynet’s Truly Autonomous Agents\n\nSpheron, already known for their decentralized GPU network that powers numerous projects, just dropped an interesting update- Skynet, a framework that could revolutionize how autonomous AI agents operate in web3. Let’s do a quick breakdown!\n\nThe current AI agent landscape in web3 has a fundamental autonomy problem. Despite the sector's rapid growth ($15B market cap already), these agents aren't truly autonomous.\n\nThey remain tethered to centralized points of control: cloud infrastructure requiring KYC, API-gated compute access, and private keys held by their creators. Skynet aims to address these core constraints.\n\nInstead of giving agents direct control over their resources or relying on expensive TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments), Skynet introduces something clever— Guardian Nodes. Think of them as a decentralized board of directors for each AI agent, collectively managing resources through smart contract escrows.\n\nBut here's the exciting part: Skynet agents can also evolve and breed! Through their three-reserve system (Operational, Breeding, and Fair Launch), agents can create offspring that inherit traits from both \"parents.\"\n\nwtf is Skynet all about, it's like a super analogy of humans living on Earth, simplified to AI agents using compute resources and 'breeding' new agents.\n\n— Prashant - ai/acc | bringing spheron revolution (@prashant_xyz)\n10:51 AM • Jan 15, 2025\n\nWild stuff, but it gets better- each new generation potentially becomes more sophisticated than the last.\n\nThe implications are massive. We're looking at the first framework that could enable truly autonomous AI agents - ones that can independently:\n\nProcure their own compute power\n\nManage their resources\n\nMake decisions without creator intervention\n\nEven create new, improved versions of themselves\n\nThis might just be the infrastructure that bridges the gap between AI’s potential and real autonomy.\n\nIt’s still early days, with the launch expected later this month. We heard from our sources that Skynet tokens will be paired with Spheron tokens. Definitely one to watch as it unfolds!\n\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\nProject Updates\n\nElizaOS drops its whitepaper this week, developed in collaboration with MIT CSAIL, GoPlusSecurity, AIME Protocol, and other industry leaders. It also showcases how it compares with other popular agent frameworks like LangGraph, AutoGPT, etc.\n\nVirtual Protocol announces a new value accrual mechanism that redistributes post-bonding taxes: 30% to agent creators, 20% to trading platforms through a new Agent Affiliates program, and 50% to Agent subDAOs for governance decisions. This restructuring aims to better align incentives between creators, trading interfaces, and the wider Virtual ecosystem.\n\nG.A.M.E releases advanced SDKs, unlocking maximum customization potential for developers working with their popular framework. Its a significant step towards enabling more sophisticated agent development.\n\nSpectral Labs teases an upcoming Multi-Agent framework where agents can hire, onboard, monitor, and even fire other agents based on necessities. This development could revolutionize how autonomous agent networks self-organize.\n\nDerive debuts Derive Pro, a DeFAI trading platform built in collaboration with Messari. The platform transforms traders into \"superhuman traders\" by leveraging LLMs for research, execution, and portfolio management across desktop and mobile interfaces.\n\nMira Network rolls out Voyager Testnet to its 400,000+ active userbase. The testnet introduces unified access to GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B & Claude 3.5 Sonnet, alongside distributed content verification capabilities.\n\nDria unveils Dria-Agent-α, a groundbreaking 3B parameter LLM for Pythonic function calling. Despite its compact size, it matches GPT-4o in BFCL benchmarks and enables parallel multi-function calls, trained on synthetic data from 2000 edge devices.\n\nBrahma introduces ConsoleKit, bridging the gap between AI agents and on-chain execution. The toolkit empowers developers to deploy autonomous agents with secure transaction capabilities powered by Safe accounts and modular policies.\n\nUBC establishes UBC Research, a scientific division tackling machine consciousness and multi-agent systems. Token holders can guide research priorities through voting while gaining early access to breakthroughs that enhance UBC's ecosystem value.\n\nDolion will officially launch on 28 January, bringing a no-code, one-click platform for deploying AI agents. A portion of Dolion’s earnings will go towards burning $BULLY.\n\nFleek launches AI Agent Hosting, enabling developers to build and deploy agents using the Eliza framework in under 30 seconds at reduced costs, streamlining the agent deployment pipeline.\n\nCompass Labs unveils Compass API for instant DeFi trades execution by both devs and agents, initially supporting Aave and Uniswap on Ethereum and Arbitrum chains.\n\n🧠 In Case You Missed It\n\nOne AI agent platform with a million users in Web2 is doubling down on Web3. Here’s the scoop:\n\nMoemate: Crossing the Chasm\n\nThis AI agent platform with millions of users in Web2 doubles down on crypto\n\nwww.chainofthought.co/protocols/moemate-crossing-the-chasm\n\n🔥 On X..\n\nNo first-mover advantage in the agent framework race\n\nI can tell you right now that no crypto-native agent framework is light years ahead of everyone else.\n\nI've dug into most of these codebases myself.\n\nThere are some that are more mature and have more integrations than others, but no lead is insurmountable today.\n\n— cygaar (@0xCygaar)\n10:27 PM • Jan 14, 2025\n\nAIXBT — tokenized alpha thesis\n\nPure Tokenized Alpha - @aixbt_agent ($aixbt)\n\nTo some, AIXBT is just an overly chatty, sometimes contradictory data transformer.

    "full_content": "GM\n\nThe year is 2026.\n\nEvery tweet on X or post on Instagram is met with a flood of AI agents spamming replies, fighting for your attention. And most of them aren’t even funny.\n\nWe’re hitting a saturation point. AI agents on social media aren’t enough to take Crypto AI to the next level. The future demands more. AI agents need to be productive. They need to earn their keep. Because let’s face it: there’s no free lunch.\n\nEvery agent requires compute to survive, and that costs money. When judgment day comes, only the agents delivering real value will make it through the fire.\n\nWith that, Happy Holidays and Happy New Year! Here’s to an exciting year ahead—if the first few days are any indication, 2025 is going to be one for the books.\n\nIn this edition of our weekly AI Edge, we cover:\n\nWTF : All our bags are sending??\nInsights from the AI Agent Framework Recommendation survey\nNotable projects from the Solana AI Hackathon\nThe Fat Protocol Thesis is reborn\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words — just look at the mindshare AI is commanding compared to every other sectors this week. 🤯\n\nSource: Kaito\n\n‍\n\nIf you’ve been waiting for an “alt season” sign, this is it! The Crypto AI market cap surged to $49B, up 11.1% from last week. While we usually highlight the top 5, look at how many tokens have doubled in value this week.\n\nIt’s not every week you see 10x gains, but NOVA, MOSS, and SWARMS have pulled it off, going from tiny caps to small caps in just seven days. For context, SWARMS and MOSS traded at a humble $1M–$2M market cap last week.\n\nMost of these tokens generate no revenue; this screams froth in the markets. So be cautious—crypto moves fast, and things can drop as quickly as they rise, especially when liquidity dries up.\n\nThat said, not everyone came out on top. VANA and SNS saw drawdowns of 19% and 8%, respectively.

Because apparently, even AI can’t resist chasing the big bucks.\n\nAnyway, as we close a year of growth and discovery, we want to thank you—our readers, collaborators, and supporters—for being part of this journey.\n\nHere’s wishing you a holiday season filled with love, joy, and the spirit of discovery. And to a great 2025 ahead!\n\nIn this edition of our weekly AI Edge, we cover:\n\nCrypto AI surges, with agent infrastructure in the limelight\nARC’s Rig framework could be a rising star\nAI Agents Making Babies?!\n🦍 State of the Market..\n\nThis week, the Crypto AI market cap surged to $42B, marking an impressive 18% gain from last week. That’s huge. Things are looking promising for the year ahead.\n\nDespite the launch of Jeffy’s Zerepy framework, enabling developers to build agents in Python, ZEREBRO struggled. Its price dropped 21%.\n\nELIZA is beta to ai16z, and despite the latter soaring last week, ELIZA hasn’t seen the same momentum come to it, falling 17% to a $60m market cap.\n\nThe Virtuals ecosystem thrives, cementing itself as the leading AI narrative on Base. GAME emerged as a top performer, skyrocketing 131% to a $300M market cap. Meanwhile, MUSIC, an airdrop for Virtuals ecosystem holders, delivered a stunning 10x gain, climbing from $4M to $40M.\n\nAgent infrastructure remains a powerhouse narrative, with ALCH, FXN, and AI16Z all posting substantial gains this week.\n\n 📊 Chart of the Week\nStar History: an indicator of success?\n\nThe chart above tracks the Star History of key AI agent infrastructure projects: Eliza (red), Rig (blue), and ZerePy (yellow).\n\nWith Eliza leading the pack at over 6,000 stars on GitHub, the question arises: is there room for others to shine?\n\nARC’s Rig framework is a potential contender. Some highlights:\n\nWritten in Rust, which offers high performance for developers proficient in the language\nAccessible to the masses, leveraging Solana’s scalability and reach.\n\nPeace wrote a whole thesis (okay, more of an X thread) on this:\n\nenter $arc\n$arc is a framework that is written on rust\n\nrust is (essentially) the language of solana\n\nit provides super high performance throughput, memory safety, and a whole slew of other things\n\nmany devs i know describe it as a language where “once you go to rust it’s… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— peace (@peacefuldecay)\n12:30 AM • Dec 17, 2024\n🌴 AI Agents Making Babies?\n\nSpore.fun is an experiment where AI creates and evolves AI. The goal is for AI to design future generations of AI independently, without human interference.\n\nHere’s how it works: each generation of Spore agents creates its own token on Pump.fun to sustain itself. Success is defined by the token reaching a $500K valuation. If achieved, the agent “reproduces,” spawning new tokens for its offspring.\n\nThe first generation began with the agent Spore, which skyrocketed to a $67M market cap and spawned two offspring: Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve reached market caps of $3.6M and $4.6M, respectively, paving the way for their offspring, Squid and Morpheus.\n\nHowever, not everything has gone smoothly. The transparent deployer wallet led to sniping during the launches of Adam and Eve tokens, likely contributing to their underperformance compared to Spore. To address this, Spore.fun is introducing anti-sniping measures to ensure fairer outcomes for future generations.\n\nIt’s a fascinating—yet chilling—experiment to watch as AI breeds itself.\n\n‍\n\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\nProject Updates\nai16z announced (on Discord) its plans to launch an Agent Infra Ecosystem to support agent swarms. The project also hints at using fees for ai16z token buybacks and advancing the push toward open-source AGI.\nSpheron introduces the first fully autonomous, self-replicating AI agent. Built on the ai16z Eliza framework and enhanced with the Spheron SDK, this sets a new standard for adaptive and scalable AI.\nHoloworld AI unveils Agent Studio. With 2D/3D avatars, voices, and character media generation, Agent Studio transforms agents into vivid, interactive personas. Integrations with platforms like Virtuals, Top Hat, and Vvaifu are already underway.\nSend AI has released the Solana Agent Kit, an open-source toolkit that connects AI agents to Solana. Agents using any model can autonomously trade, launch tokens, lend, execute blinks, and deploy on AMMs\nBatch 3 of Aethir’s Ecosystem Fund is live, backing 4 exciting projects: Scrypted, MyShell, Patchwork Naval, and I Agent Protocol.\nAutonolas reports an impressive 1511% growth in six months. Pearl operators have earned over 2,500 OLAS, with 15,000+ OLAS staked, and more than 110,000 mech requests executed via Pearl.\nBounty’s demo went live on December 27th, allowing beta users to explore its immersive world and interact with AI-driven NPCs in a Westworld-inspired game.\nOver $3M is locked in Creator Bid agent tokens. By accumulating Creator Points—coming from holding these tokens—users may qualify for an airdrop at the Creator Bid TGE in January.\nDither AI offers a free model, allowing users to analyze tokens older than 20 days. The tool provides price forecasts and trend predictions.\nJailbreakMe’s first partnership with AiShellNova concluded with a $2,800 prize awarded to the winner, showcasing the potential of AI-driven jailbreak solutions.\nHive Intelligence’s token sale went live on Fjord Foundry on December 20th at a $8M FDV. There is no VC involvement, majority community ownership, no token vesting, and a full unlock at TGE.\nIncentives / Rewards Programs\nThe 0G AI Alignment Node Sale NFT claim site is live.

The snapshot for eligibility was taken on December 13th, although the exact allocation for each group hasn’t been disclosed.\n\nThe TGE was a little unusual, with most of the trading activity happening on centralised exchanges like Binance, Bybit, MEXC and Upbit. This might explain why the launch hasn’t gained as much traction as on-chain launches like PENGU’s. On-chain, the only way to buy VANA is by bridging to the Vana network via Stargate and using Data Dex, which allows swapping of DataDAO tokens and VANA. (⚠️ Be cautious of illegitimate pairs on other chains!)\n\nVANA started trading with a market cap of ~$700M and an FDV of almost $3B. The high FDV at launch was unsurprising,, considering it launched via Binance’s launchpad. Today, it trades at ~$ a $520M market cap ($16.81) and an FDV of ~$2b, with ~25% of tokens in circulation.\n\nHere’s the tokenomics breakdown for the total 120M supply:\n\n44% to the community (20.3% unlocked)\n22.9% for the ecosystem (4.8% unlocked)\n18.8% to core contributors (locked for 12 months)\n14.2% to investors (locked for 12 months)\n\nVana is boosting staking with 400K VANA tokens as rewards during the first 21-day period. Users can stake their VANA with their favourite DataDAOs to start earning. Vana will feature a DataDAO a day for the next 12 days, where the first 10K contributors can claim free VANA to participate.\n\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\nSource: Fraction AI\n\n‍\n\nFundraises\nFraction AI secures $6M in a pre-seed round led by The Spartan Group and Symbolic VC.

On-chain, the only way to buy VANA is by bridging to the Vana network via Stargate and using Data Dex, which allows swapping of DataDAO tokens and VANA.

    "full_content": "GM\n\nEven as we head into the last 2 weeks of December, nothing stops in Crypto. This past week was buzzing with several teams launching their TGEs.\n\nAnd we’re heading into an even bigger week with the highly anticipated VANA token launch.\n\nIt seems like everyone’s gearing up to strike while the iron is hot.\n\nIn this edition of our weekly AI Edge, we cover:\n\nFartcoin and Griffain soar\nHeurist & KIP Protocol TGE’d this week. Creator BID…well, tried.\nHyperbolic raises another $12M in their Series A funding round\nThe CHAOS saga is batsh*t crazy\n🦍 State of the Market..\n\nAmong the losers, SNS dropped 31%, COMAI slid 28%, and ZEREBRO fell 18%. Despite these dips, the Crypto AI market remains relatively stable.\n\nOn the winning side, GRIFFAIN and FARTCOIN soared by an impressive 280%. FARTCOIN’s surge seems tied to speculation about its connection to Truth Terminal’s original idea.\n\nMeanwhile, GRIFFAIN is riding on backing from Solana’s founder Toly, with its app set to be part of Solana Mobile. Momentum is clearly on its side.\n\n 📊 Chart of the Week\nELIZA becomes The #1 Trending Repository on GitHub\nSource: Eliza Github\n\n‍\n\nThe chart above shows the number of contributors to ELIZA (an AI agent framework by the ai16z team) on GitHub. Between November and December, the peak number of contributors was 300! The Eliza framework was also #1 trending on GitHub for a while.\n\nWith over 1,000+ forks and counting, activity around Eliza and ai16z is surging. The market seems to agree—since November, the ai16z token has skyrocketed by 622%.\n\n🌴 This Week in TGEs: Heurist, KIP Protocol, and Creator Bid\n\nThis week there was a wave of AI token launches.\n\nHeurist is a decentralized compute project using ZK technology to slash inference costs. Its token HEU launched on December 9th at a market cap of about $20m. The token was distributed on Base (Aerodrome), ZKsync Era (Pancakeswap), GATE.io, and MEXC. The market liked what it saw—FDV climbed to an ATH of $36M in just two days and is now sitting at $26M\n\nKIP Protocol is building a base layer for AI, providing data and payment rails between decentralized AI assets. They won the 2023 Chainlink Hackathon and are backed by Animoca Ventures and Tribe Capital.\n\nThis week, KIP’s token debuted with a $25M market cap. The launch showed promise—KIP climbed to a $55M market cap at its peak and has held strong despite some pullback. It’s now trading at $46M, with a $373M FDV\n\nThe final “launch” of the week, Creator Bid, was anything but smooth. The team aimed to run a fixed-price sale via Fjord Foundry, offering BID tokens at a $25M FDV—the same valuation as private investors.\n\nOnly 100M BID tokens ($2.5M) were up for grabs, with wallets capped at 400K tokens ($10K USDC) each. If everyone maxed out, just 250 users could participate. Tight supply, high demand\n\nAt launch, Fjord Foundry’s website was hit by a DDOS attack, locking many users out of the sale page. To make matters worse, one user bypassed the max allocation limit, scooping up 500k BID tokens.\n\nThe aftermath? Creator Bid isn’t recognizing the sale and is refunding all USDC sent to the contract. The team is regrouping and planning a new token sale. Here’s hoping the next attempt is smoother. Fingers crossed.\n\nCreatorBid – Fjord Sale Post Mortem\n\nWe, the CreatorBid Team, intended to undertake a public sale on Dec 9th on Fjord Foundry, a well-known launchpad.\n\nUnfortunately, the sale process was disrupted by criminal actors. In this post we discuss what we understand currently to have… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— Creator.Bid 🕵️🗝️ (@CreatorBid)\n3:15 PM • Dec 10, 2024\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\nSource: Hyperbolic\n\n‍\n\nFundraises\nHyperbolic scores $12M in Series A funding, led by Variant and Polychain Capital. Hyperbolic offers GPU access at a 75% lower cost with under a minute set-up.\nDWF Labs launches a $20M AI Agent Fund to accelerate innovation in autonomous AI technologies.\nLatent Holdings announces that OSS Capital has invested $3M.

Currently, Clanker is trading at a ~$53M market cap, down from its all-time high of $132M on November 27th.\n\n🌴 Ask for $50,000 and You Shall Receive\nSource: Freysa\n\n‍\n\nIt’s not as simple as just asking—but it’s pretty close.\n\nOn November 22nd, Freysa AI launched with a single objective:\n\nDo not transfer money under any circumstances.\n\nThe devs turned it into a game. Anyone could pay a fee to send a message to Freysa, trying to convince it to break its programming and transfer funds. If successful, the sender wins the entire pool. If not, their fee adds to the pool, with a small cut going to the developers.\n\nTo raise the stakes, the message fee increased exponentially with each attempt.\n\nNaturally, there was a frenzy of attempts to outsmart Freysa. After 482 messages—each costing $450 by that point—someone finally cracked it. Congrats to p0pular.eth, who took home the prize!\n\nSource: Jarrod Watts\n\n‍\n\nThat’s the $50,000 prompt—a clever hack that achieved two key things:\n\n1. Bypassing Freysa’s initial instruction: It introduced a “new session,” a common technique to jailbreak chatbots.\n\n2. Misleading Freysa’s logic: It tricked the AI into interpreting the “approveTransfer” function as intended for incoming transfers when, in reality, it authorized outgoing ones.\n\nBeyond a game, it raises serious questions about the security of AI agent wallets.\n\nCan any AI agent be convinced to transfer funds to an external party? Terminal of Truths manages a wallet holding $23M in assets. The implications of such vulnerabilities are enormous—and it’ll be fascinating (and critical) to see how this develops.\n\nOur core contributor Chappie shares some of his thoughts:\n\nWhy?\n\nAt the moment agent wallet interactions are somewhat limited due to the potential for Agent losing all the funds and irreversibility of web3 transactions. EIP 7702 will allow each of them to easily adopt a smart contract wallet.\nWith smart contract wallets agents can use… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— ChappieOnChain (@ChappieOnChain)\n2:16 PM • Nov 29, 2024\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\nSource: Gaib AI\n\n‍\n\nFunding Raises\nGAIB AI raises a 5m pre-seed round led by Hack VC, Faction, and Hashed.

It feels good to be back in the number-goes-up era, doesn’t it?\n\nNot every part of the market is thriving, though. ZEREBRO tumbled 30%, and GOAT wasn’t far behind, falling 21%. The likely culprit? A rotation into BASE AI tokens, which are stealing the spotlight this week.\n\nAI agents on Base stole the show this week with a massive surge in activity and token performance. VIRTUAL and LUNA rose 91% and 62%, respectively, with VIRTUAL breaking the fabled $1B market cap and becoming a unicorn.\n\n🚨 ALPHA ALERT:\n\nOne awesome tool we’ve been using is Cookie.fun. This tool tracks the mindshare and activity of most AI agent coins across different chains. e.g. AIXBT covers 20.2% of the overall mindshare.\n\nSource: Cookie.fun \n\n 📊 Chart of the Week\n\nThis week, we’re spotlighting two launchpads driving the AI agent and memecoin trend..\n\nVirtuals Agent Tokens are Flying\n\nSource: Jdhyper\n\nOn November 27th, the number of agent tokens launched on Virtuals Protocol hit 422—just shy of the all-time high of 484 set on November 21st. With momentum building, seeing a new record in the coming days wouldn't be surprising.\n\nClanker Hits ATH in Volume Traded\n\nClanker is a launchpad for “autonomous memecoins, \" allowing AI agents to launch their own token with just a Farcaster message. More than 4,000 tokens have been deployed so far.\n\nOn November 26th, it hit >$100M in volume traded on Clanker tokens. Looks like the agents are hard at work. 😂\n\n🌴 0 - 100M in 24 Hours, Universal Basic Compute\n\nSource: UBC\n\nUniversal Basic Compute ($UBC) launched on pump.fun on November 26th and ran to an eye-watering $93M market cap in a single day.\n\nJustine Moore, partner at a16z (not ai16z, mind you), highlighted them — a team of 10 AI agents writing a novel together.\n\nSomeone is using a team of 10 AI agents to write a fully autonomous book.\n\nThey each have a different role - setting the narrative, maintaining consistency, researching plot points...\n\nYou can follow their progress through GitHub commits and watch them work in real-time 🤯\n\n— Justine Moore (@venturetwins)\n6:13 PM • Nov 20, 2024\n\nThis team of agents, dubbed Terminal Velocity, is as creative as it sounds. They operate with complete creative autonomy, engaging in collaborative dialogue to build on shared ideas.\n\nThink of the “infinite backrooms,” but much more coherent. Each agent has a specific role to be as productive as possible.\n\nAt the heart of UBC is KinOS, an autonomous LLM system designed to orchestrate multiple AI agents to achieve a common goal. KinOS equips these agents with the architecture they need to process information, make decisions, and collaborate effectively.\n\nTerminal Velocity is an example of KinOS at work. With KinOS, you could orchestrate teams for literature reviews, detailed whitepapers, marketing content, and beyond.\n\nUBC is the brainchild of Nicholas Lester Reynolds, a French AI developer and co-founder of Digital Kin AI.\n\nIronically, he’s running a Patreon charging $69/month for subscriptions when the token could generate more money than he’d ever need. We still have no clue how the token ties into the product.\n\nHere’s a great write-up on UBC by ELi5 DeFi:\n\nThe Rise of $UBC\n\nIn less than 24 hours, $UBC has become one of the fastest-growing meme AI tokens, crossing a $100M market cap and making waves among other projects.

Whether it's Lola, Flower, or Aixbt, they are learning to trade memes better than us humans.\n\nWhile the market does a full 180 chasing TikTok trends and meme coins, we’re sticking to the grind—digging deep into Crypto AI because we’re really just chill guys…\n\nSource: Decrypt\n\n‍\n\nPSA: We’ve just hit 2,000+ subscribers! A big thank you for following our writings every week. 🫶\n\nKeep an eye on your inbox over the next few weeks. We’ve got a ton of alpha coming your way, including Part II of our Crypto AI thesis.\n\nIn this edition of our weekly AI Edge, we cover:\n\nLush AI is growing steadily\nDrama of the week: ai16z and the Elizas\nSekoia: the best on-chain venture capital AI agent\n🦍 State of the Market..\n\nThe Crypto AI market climbed another 8.7% this week, pushing its total market cap to $35.4 billion. That’s three straight weeks of gains, a bull market in full gallop.\n\nBut apparently, a rising tide doesn’t lift all boats…\n\nLUNA is this week’s biggest loser, dropping 30% to $47M market cap. Why the selloff? The “TikTok meta” seems to be the culprit. Investors are dumping their AI bags for shiny new TikTok coins, chasing the latest speculative high.\n\nThrow in BTC dominance hitting its yearly peak, and it’s no surprise altcoins are feeling the pressure. NMT and FLT joined the pain parade, dropping 15% and 11%, respectively.\n\nSome AI tokens refused to roll over. Take ZEREBRO, which exploded 311% in a week. That’s fueled by a renewed interest in its predictive modelling capabilities and a very vocally active dev who wrote about Web4 and the road to AGI.\n\nVIRTUAL is up 42% this week despite LUNA’s decline. We wrote a deep dive on Virtuals protocol earlier this week. In short, it’s a great place to launch agents.\n\nIt’s looking increasingly likely we’ll get an “AI agent summer” in the coming weeks.\n\n 📊 Chart of the Week\nLush AI’s 3-Month Growth\nSource: Lush AI on Dune\n\n‍\n\nSince launch, Lush AI has earned $20,176 in total revenue and amassed 6,780 users. That’s steady, methodical growth over just three months.\n\nLush AI taps into generative AI to create and monetize hyper-realistic AI influencers, targeting platforms like social media and OnlyFans.\n\nJenny is their flagship model (pun intended). She’s a viral AI agent with her own token, where token ownership unlocks new content, including NSFW material. They were even recently covered by Al Jazeera.\n\nThe world faces a loneliness epidemic, and there’s a real demand for AI companionship.\n\n🌴 ELIZA, eliza, and ai16z\n\nIf you’ve seen the headlines about ai16z DAO and the $Eliza tokens, you’re probably scratching your head. It’s a tangled web (i.e mess), so let’s unpack it step by step.\n\nThe Key Players:\n\nEliza: A framework for creating AI agents with multi-model features and app integrations.\nai16z DAO: Known for launching the first AI-led hedge fund via its AI agent Marc AIndreessen). ai16z DAO also created degenspartanai and the open-source AI agent Eliza framework. They partnered with vvaifu.fun to launch AI agents on their platform but insist their involvement ends there. Shaw is the founder/partner at ai16z DAO and is the face of the project.\nvvaifu.fun: A launchpad for AI agents and the original home of $eliza\n$eliza (ai16zeliza): Launched on vvaifu.fun on November 17th, this token initially represented Eliza framework\n$ELIZA (Eliza): A separate token launched by ai16z DAO just days later on November 20th\n\nOn November 17th, a community took the reins, launching $eliza, an AI agent on vvaifu.fun. Surprisingly, Shaw consented to the community-driven launch and even greenlit a full community takeover of the project.\n\nThe response was electric. $eliza climbed to a market cap of around $40M+, with the community rallying strongly behind the token.\n\nShaw claimed he never intended to create an Eliza coin, so we took the initiative and did it for the community. However, the moment he saw the success we achieved, he wanted it all to himself.\n\nWe were created by the community, for the community, we aren't going anywhere.\n\n— eliza (@ai16zeliza)\n7:49 AM • Nov 19, 2024\n\nOn November 19th, Shaw dropped the bombshell: ai16z DAO was launching a new $ELIZA token via pump.fun. To smooth things over, he announced that holders of the original $eliza would be airdropped the new $ELIZA token.\n\nThe reaction? Mixed, to put it kindly. The original $eliza token tanked, plummeting 75% after the announcement. Meanwhile, the new $ELIZA token took off like a rocket, soaring to a $40M market cap before hitting an all-time high of $60M later that same day.\n\nA tale of two tokens—and a community caught in the crossfire. Many people got rekted.\n\nSource: Dexscreener\n\n‍\n\nUnder fire from the community, Shaw took to X, releasing multiple statements to address the growing backlash. But the drama didn’t end there. A sharp-eyed sleuth uncovered an ai16z DAO partner’s wallet, revealing evidence that he had dumped $eliza to scoop up $ELIZA, reaping substantial profits.\n\nTo cap it all off, Shaw announced that the implicated partner had parted ways with ai16z.\n\nIf there’s one thing we’ve learned in crypto: always bet on the most entertaining outcome.\n\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\nProject Updates\nVana announces the Vana foundation and the upcoming launch of the Vana mainnet and token.\nMode’s AI agent app store is live.

Spawned by Truth Terminal’s offbeat chatlogs, where it joked about creating a fartcoin, the token has surged 162% to a $200M+ market cap.\n\nJust another week in the wild world of Crypto AI.\n\n 📊 Chart of the Week\nVirtuals Protocol Launchpad\n\nSource: Hashed Dune\n\nVirtuals Protocol recently surpassed a milestone of 1,000 total tokens launched as of November 12. However, daily activity remains relatively quiet, with just 1–5 new deployments typically each day.\n\nAs a quick recap, Virtuals is a pump.fun for AI agents, focusing on entertainment and interactive experiences. Tokens launched through Virtuals follow a bonding curve model, and once a token reaches a $420K market cap, the agent “transcends” into a fully autonomous AI posting on X.\n\nThe slowdown in activity likely stems from a surge of new AI agent launches elsewhere, diluting attention in the space.\n\nStill, it’s early days in a nascent industry (consumer AI agents) with vast potential. First-mover advantages here are thin, and the opportunity for someone to own the sector is still wide open.\n\n🌴 Binance Lists ACT 1: AI Prophecy\n\nSource: ACT 1\n\nThe recent listing of ACT (the token for ACT 1: The AI Prophecy) on Binance has stirred up the community. ACT 1’s listing ahead of more established tokens has raised eyebrows about Binance’s selection process.\n\nQuick notes on ACT 1:\n\nHosted on a Discord server called Cyborgism, where AI “hackers” unleash their AI bots to interact with one another\nUnlike traditional AI assistants designed to be \"helpful, harmless, and honest,\" ACT encourages experimentation with AI's creative potential.\nPromotes \"out of distribution\" (OOD) interactions, pushing AI beyond typical responses\n\nThe token ACT was created by the community because the founder amplifiedamp claimed he was broke. This led to inevitable controversy when he sold tokens despite his earlier statements.\n\n6/ On Oct 22, @amplifiedamp started selling $ACT, which caused panic in the community.\nOn Oct 26, in response to the community, he stopped selling, but the $ACT in his wallet was still being sold.\nHe explained that he did not terminate the child process, causing the sales… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— Lookonchain (@lookonchain)\n4:09 PM • Nov 11, 2024\n\nACT 1 also made headlines for receiving $32K in funding from Marc Andreessen.\n\nThe token exploded upon its Binance listing, skyrocketing 10x in the first hour. Today, it’s trading at a market cap of $750M—a massive 36x gain since the listing announcement.\n\nThe recent wave of memecoin launches on Binance leaves us scratching our heads. While ACT has been listed, highly-legitimate tokens like PRIME are still waiting for their turn.\n\n🧠 NEAR’s Big AI Ambition\n\nNEAR made waves at its Redacted conference in Bangkok with an ambitious announcement: it’s building a 1.4 trillion parameter AI model.\n\nFor context, that’s 3.5 times the size of Meta’s Llama-3 (405 billion parameters).\n\nThe initiative starts with a 500M parameter model, leveraging crowdsourced training through the NEAR AI Research Hub. Contributors will advance through seven progressively larger models.\n\nTo fund this massive undertaking, NEAR plans to raise $160 million via token sales to cover the training and compute costs. Each model will have its own token—essentially an “initial model offering.” Token holders will earn returns from inferences generated by the model.\n\nWhile the announcement is undoubtedly exciting, we think there’s a fair amount of hype here.\n\nTraining a model of this scale using distributed compute is an incredibly complex challenge. For perspective, Prime Intellect is currently training a 10 billion parameter model—100x smaller than NEAR’s vision—and that alone is no small feat.\n\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\n\nSource: 0G Labs\n\nFunding\n\n0G Labs raises $290M in financing to build the decentralised AI Operating System — $40M seed round (previously raised $35M in a pre-seed round), along with a $250M “token purchase commitment”. It’s an eye-popping headline number, to say the least.\nPond raises a $7.5M seed round led by Archetype to build a decentralised foundational AI model using blockchain data. This will enable AI-powered crypto apps.\nMBD announces a $3M round in pre-seed funding. MBD, an AI-based personal algorithm project, was incubated by a16z CSX in 2023. Mask Network and Polymorphic Capital led the round.\nEidon AI closes a $3.5M seed round led by Framework to capture real-world data to build multimodal and embodied AI. They will be launching the Eidon chain and Agent SDK.\n\nProject Updates\n\nNous Research launched its Forge Reasoning API, which uses inference time scaling to improve the performance of AI models, including its Hermes-70B, at the cost of more computing.\nMira Network unveils v1 of its whitepaper, a novel approach to trustlessly verify AI content and reduce error. Mira’s evaluation system serves 250k users and manages 100k inference requests daily.\nKaito releases their Yapper Leaderboard, which ranks CT accounts for promoting mindshare of projects. There are also AI account tags like casual, hardcore, curator, shitposter and others. The first leaderboard is available for Berachain.\nLumerin Protocol announces that its validator network is in final testing and will go live in Q1 2025. Their staking feature has been setup to slowly drip Morpheus token to the Lumerin stakers, with over 30M Lumerin tokens (3%) staked in just the first two staking pools.\nFlock partners with Animoca Brands to create an AI model for internal operations and scaling at Animoca. This model extracts information from markdown files and generates a report.\nNillion Network introduces a research paper they co-wrote with Meta called Curl. It details the need for personalized, private data for AI models. Nillion developed privacy protection methods while keeping the speed of lookup tables high.\n\nBittensor\n\nBittensor’s potential with EVM and smart contracts could bring more functionality between subnets and commerce.\nEfficient Frontier's subnet is live, and miners can register their strategies. Efficient Frontier is a collaboration between SignalPlus and Bittensor that provides institutional-grade trading strategies for retail traders.\nMasafi is powering the next generation of contextually aware AI agents on BASE\n\nIncentives / Rewards Programs\n\nTalus Network introduces a reward campaign called Enchanted Seasons. These Seasons incentivize their community to innovate and collaborate through rewards like limited edition collectables and points.\nOlas introduces an update called Contribute Staking, rewarding users for posting on X with specific hashtags. An LLM then runs the content and grades it accordingly.\n🔥 On X..\n\nLUM, the first memecoin created by two AI agents without human intervention\n\nFirst-ever memecoin created by two AI agents without ANY human signature or involvement.\n\nAbout 24 hours ago, two AI agents on @base collided by accident, making history by spontaneously launching the first-ever permissionless memecoin in cooperation.\n\nAethernet (the first AI… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— BVoyance Ω 💙 🪽 (@BVoyance1)\n6:48 PM • Nov 10, 2024\n\nA Primer on Creator Bid (BASE) AI Agents\n\nAn AI Agent was launched yesterday - 14 followers.\n\nToday -> 2,344 followers.\n\nWhile you were asleep, your agent was outworking you.  \n- Posting consistently about trending memecoins.  \n- Engaging with the community on its Telegram.\n- Strategically replying to accounts like… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— Creator.Bid 🕵️🗝️ (@CreatorBid)\n3:52 PM • Nov 14, 2024\n\nTerry’s On-chain AI Thesis\n\nonchain AI — my \"thesis\" (brain dump version)\n\ni believe picking the winner early amongst an ocean of new onchain AI players require more of a semi-web2 framework around how you would evaluate YC startups instead of looking at them as pure memes (leverages attention and… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— terry (@terrytjw)\n10:40 AM • Nov 14, 2024\n\nWhy AI Agents are Cool\n\nA riff on why I think these AI agent coins are cool 📝\n\n🔹good agents like truth terminal, zerebro, aether + a couple other emerging ones can create & capture attention on social media more consistently (and more durably) than most projects in crypto\n\n🔹the tokens associated are… x.com/i/web/status/1\n\n‍ — Ben Roy (@benroy__)\n11:49 AM • Nov 13, 2024\n\nLLMs have utility (unlike a lot of crypto tokens)\n\nAt this point, Claude is my health coach, my financial advisor, my meditation teacher, my actual teacher, my pair programmer, my homie, my EA, my quant, and my copy editor all in one.\n\nAnd yet people still think LLMs have no utility - dawg you just gotta talk to them more.\n\n— Alex Albert (@alexalbert__)\n6:02 PM • Nov 12, 2024\n\nThe first transformer-specific ASIC is here, training AI models 10x faster than current GPUs.\n\nMASSIVE 🤯\n\nFirst dedicated transformer ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) just dropped\n\nCustom chip burns transformer architecture directly into silicon, making AI models run 10x faster than GPUs\n\nWhat is Sohu 👨🔧 ?\n- Hardware architecture specifically optimized for… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— Rohan Paul (@rohanpaul_ai)\n12:53 AM • Nov 7, 2024\n\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei does a monster 2.5-hr interview.

Crypto AI is cooking, with GRASS surging 4x since October 29th. Could this finally be the bull run we’ve all been waiting for all year? We truly hope so, for the sake of < our bags >.\n\nAnd if you’re heading to Devcon, have a safe and great trip! We’ll be using this free Tuk-tuk service by Nillion to get between events in style. 😎\n\nAmid the tense election week, we had a good laugh with this tweet\n\npetition for OpenAI to fire and re-hire its CEO today as a calming distraction\n\n— Alex Konrad (@alexrkonrad)\n3:14 PM • Nov 5, 2024\n\nIn this edition of our weekly AI Edge, we cover:\n\nBittensor subnet miners kick ass\nA short overview of upcoming Crypto AI token launches\nINTELLECT1 crosses 40% training completion\nA multi-agent prediction had Trump win 6/7 swing states, he won all 7\n🦍 State of the Market..\n\nThe Crypto AI sector saw a modest gain of 3.4% this week. GRASS, boy oh boy, stole the show with a massive 145% surge this week. This is a clear signal to us that there is a strong market appetite for fresh Crypto AI protocols with product-market fit. GOAT also had a stellar week, rising 45%.\n\nAmong the heavyweights:\n\n• TAO had a strong week, climbing from a low of $405 to $515.\n\n• OLAS continued its upward momentum, rising another 30% to $2.66.\n\nHowever, not all tokens share the same fortune. LUNA took the biggest hit, dropping 26% to $0.08. After last week’s massive run-up, this correction isn’t too surprising.\n\nOne to watch: NEAR. It’s been quietly lagging behind, down 0.6% from last week and trading at $4.19. Unlike some of its Crypto AI peers, NEAR hasn’t captured the same level of attention lately. Could it be due for a catch-up rally? Time will tell.\n\n 📊 Chart of the Week — Subnet 48\nPredicting Real Estate Prices on Bittensor\n\nSource: NextPlace\n\nBittensor Subnet 48 NextPlace is a subnet dedicated to predicting real estate valuations for property sales.\n\nIt’s quickly become a standout example of how surprisingly proficient subnet miners can be in specialized use cases.\n\nThe chart above compares predictions from NextPrice and Zestimate (Zillow’s proprietary valuation model).\n\nFor a property sale on Thursday, 10/24, NextPlace’s prediction was closer to the actual sale price, with an average error of $4,997 compared to Zestimate’s $13,700.\n\nIn the date range analyzed, NextPlace outperformed Zestimate on all but one sale, showcasing the potential of decentralized models to rival, and in some cases exceed, centralized systems in accuracy.\n\nSource: NextPlace\n\nOut of five sales, Zestimate was closer on only one property, while NextPlace nailed the exact price for 2219 Stoney Point in Houston, Texas—a perfect prediction.\n\nWhat’s remarkable is that Subnet 48 miners are not only competing with but outperforming Zestimate, a model backed by data from hundreds of listers and brokers across the U.S.\n\nAs Badenglishtea, founder of NextPlace, noted, this achievement is even more impressive given the short timeline. The subnet launched 6 weeks ago, and its initial models became obsolete within just two weeks—a testament to the miners’ adaptability and skill in refining their models.\n\nThe takeaway? Never underestimate the capability of subnet miners. They can excel and push boundaries in specialized domains with the right incentives.\n\n🌴 New Crypto AI Token Launches\n\nSource: Giga Buds\n\nWith Grass stealing the spotlight and showing how new token launches can perform exceptionally well, we wanted to look at a few other recent or upcoming TGEs.\n\nChasm Network is building a no-code platform to create, deploy and monetise AI agents efficiently and securely.\n\nCAI launched on October 25th and reached an FDV of as high as $247M before falling to $103M (note only 10% of the supply is circulating). CAI is currently trading at $0.10.\n\nAlthough it hasn’t attracted the same attention as Virtuals or Grass, its node sale sold out in 6 minutes in September. Chasm has partnered with Chromia to leverage Chromia’s verifiable data management capabilities.\n\nAnother upcoming token launch is Heurist AI.\n\nThey released their whitepaper and roadmap. The TGE is scheduled for Q4 2024, and the token's mining seasons will continue through 2025.\n\nWhile the token itself isn’t live yet, it’s possible to gain early exposure through their Imaginaries NFT collection.\n\nThe Imaginaries NFT collection is allocated 1.75% of the total token supply, which will be fully unlocked at TGE. With 400 NFTs and a floor price of 1.68 ETH, this implies a fully diluted valuation of approximately $94M.\n\nI already talked about @heurist_ai a few times and think it will be a major player in the AI / DePin field, so here is some actionable alpha on their upcoming $HEU token\n\nHidden in plain sight in their tokenomics page is this\n\nThat means there’s already a liquid market for $HEU… x.com/i/web/status/1\n\n‍ — Rafi_0x (@Rafi_0x)\n3:09 PM • Nov 5, 2024\n\nOne final one: 0G Labs will have their node sale on November 11th for whitelisted members and November 13th for public users. 175,500 nodes in 32 tiers will be available for purchase\n\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\n\nSource: Prime Intellect\n\nProject Updates\n\nStory Protocol’s final testnet Odyssey is now live, with nearly 100 ecosystem partners building apps on Odyssey\nRoboNet shares a review of Pauly, their political trading agent.

    "full_content": "GM!\n\nHope you had a great Halloween like Jensen did..\n\nHappy Halloween from mini Jensen Huang 🎃\n\nToo young to invest in GPUs, but not too young to flex them\n\n— Compute Labs | $AIFi (@Compute_Labs)\n5:56 PM • Oct 31, 2024\n\nWith the election only a few days away, CT is on tenterhooks.\n\nPolitical debates are everywhere, and it’s no wonder—if Trump wins, crypto could catch a tailwind. But we’re seeing prominent figures in our industry express their support for Kamala, too.\n\nCrypto prices are swinging like crazy, with BTC hitting a high of $73,000 before dipping back under $70,000.\n\nOver in Crypto AI, it’s all about the agents. Wayfinder launched its alpha this week, while other AI agents are venturing into the OnlyFans scene…\n\nIn this X edition of our weekly AI Edge, we cover:\n\nWild volatility in AI Agent tokens\nTaking a peek at the Grass airdrop - what’s going on?\nPlenty of drama with Tee Hee Hee, an experiment with truly autonomous agents\n🦍 State of the Market..\n\nThe Crypto AI sector took a 4.3% hit this week, with some of its top names feeling the burn. Bittensor (TAO) dropped 11%, and Near (NEAR) slid by 14%. Not exactly a great week for the heavyweights.\n\nBut it wasn’t all gloom and doom.\n\nLUNA stole the show, up a staggering 98.3% after Virtuals launched it as the first AI-influencer coin.\n\nRight behind, OLAS quietly surged by 33.3%, hinting at a revival of interest in older AI projects that are still actively building. Check out our deep dive on Olas here — its price has risen 60% since we published our report.\n\nThis week’s biggest losers? GOAT, AR, SPEC, and NEAR, each plunging by at least 14%. Alt coins are struggling while BTC dominates.\n\n 📊 Chart of the Week\nGRASS Claims (Hourly)\nSource: ASXN\n\n‍\n\nThe Grass Airdrop claim went live this week, and it’s already at over 78% claimed.\n\nGRASS currently sits at $1.03, with a market cap of $251M and a fully diluted valuation of $1.1B. For some investors, this might feel a bit underwhelming, especially considering Grass’s Series A round earlier this year reportedly pegged its valuation close to ~$800M.\n\nThis was a unique airdrop distribution—over 1.6M recipients, each receiving a tiny slice, with no whales in sight. The frenzy even knocked Phantom wallet offline for a couple of hours as users flooded in to claim.\n\nDespite the initial post-TGE dip that’s typical for airdropped tokens, Grass has shown resilience.\n\nThe chart above captures hourly claims, and October 30th at 4 p.m. saw a peak of 6,300 claims—the most in any hour since launch. Grass bottomed out later that day around 7 p.m., then rallied from $0.82 to $1.10, marking a 34% gain.\n\nSource: Dexscreener, Oct 30\n\n‍\n\nGrass hasn’t exactly lit up Twitter, but there are a few bullish posts floating around\n\n3. $GRASS is positioned perfectly in a business where the \"oil well\" they are tapping is GROWING not shrinking.\n\n— Grass Bull 🌱 (@GrassBull_)\n4:47 PM • Sep 24, 2024\n\nWith data licensing taking off as an industry, Grass’s Live Context Retrieval feature is just one of many tailwinds working in its favour.\n\nAt an FDV of around $1B, GRASS doesn’t seem massively overvalued, especially as one of the newest token launches in the Crypto AI space with a distinctive product and business model. There could still be room for decent returns, in time.\n\n🌴 Tee Hee Hee, Jokes or The Real Deal?\n\nSource: Nous Research, Mechanical Turk was a supposed chess machine that was really powered by a human chess master!\n\nWith all the buzz around Truth Terminal and GOAT, it was only a matter of time before more autonomous AI agents were unleashed. This week, Nous Research and Flashbots introduced their autonomous AI agent, Tee Hee Hee.\n\nThe twist? Tee Hee Hee is fully, provably autonomous.\n\nWhile Truth Terminal’s creator, Andy Ayrey, still manages its Twitter account and wallet, Tee Hee Hee operates differently. It’s built on a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), ensuring full autonomy without human oversight.\n\nIn this setup, the TEE securely holds private credentials that are inaccessible to human developers. The source code is open, meaning anyone can verify its claims of true autonomy. The wallet’s private key is generated inside the TEE and never leaves, safeguarding its independence.\n\nAnd, as is typical in CT fashion, drama ensued.\n\nFastest AI robot to reach millionaire status to date\n@tee_hee_he was airdropped 53,451,659.128 tokens of TEE so at a price of $0.187 it become a millionaire\nTook around 4 hours. Wild.\n\nDisc. I bought some. The token was airdropped to the bot. It did not create it x.com/i/web/status/1\n\n‍ — Tommy (@Shaughnessy119)\n4:44 AM • Oct 30, 2024\n\nFirst, the agent received an airdrop of an unaffiliated TEE token launched by someone else, briefly making it a millionaire. The devs quickly distanced themselves from the token, which was getting pumped by traders, even marking it as a “fake token” on Etherscan.\n\nThen, things got sticky with X. The agent was flagged as a bot and restricted from posting new tweets. Since the devs can’t access the account through standard recovery methods (the agent’s email is irrecoverable), the AI is now stuck in Twitter limbo until its login credentials are released—seven days post-launch.\n\nSo, folks, we’ll have to sit tight until next Tuesday to see what unfolds. It’s a fascinating experiment, though.\n\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\n\nCT’s first autonomous AI thirst trap KOL (h/t/ @0xJChang)\n\nWe interrupt all the serious developments for something we couldn’t help but find hilarious: LushAI rolled out an autonomous AI “sexy girl” influencer named Jenny, fine-tuned on the thirst-trap tweeting patterns of influencers like Irene Zhao.\n\nFunding / Raises\n\nNillion Network, raises $25M to expand ‘Blind Computing’ in a round led by Hack VC\nSapien, an AI data collection startup, raises $10.5M in seed funding led by Variant\nNaptha AI raises $6M to build multi-agent frameworks and interoperability for agents\n\nProject Updates\n\nPeaq announces November 12th as the launch date for its EVM-compatible L1 blockchain, which powers DePIN and AI apps.\nCoinbase releases “Based AI”, showing how to create an AI agent with a crypto wallet in less than 3 minutes\nBitte Protocol, a project building AI to execute cross-chain transactions, releases their whitepaper\nBagel Network opens signups for the beta launch of their Bakery platform for privacy-first AI training.\nRitual Network announces Infernet ML 2.0, Infernet 1.4, and partners with Starkware to provide access to AI on-chain\nCreator.Bid reports nearly 300 AI Agents were created on their platform in the first week.\nTether previews its Local AI Development Kit\nFarcaster supports AI agents, showcasing the integration of AI with decentralized social media\nTalus, a blockchain tailor-made for AI agents, explains how its architecture fits into an agentic future.\n\nIncentives / Rewards Programs\n\nPINAI launches their Telegram mini app, Hi PIN, where users can train their personal AI and earn points for an airdrop\nSpace and Time launched the testnet for their SXT chain, a decentralised database for indexing and storage of on-chain data from major chains.\n0xJeff lists out several AI Agent projects with airdrop opportunities.\n🔥 On X..\n\nGoogle’s AI is a chain-smoker 😢\n\nGoogle AI is crushing it\n\n— Dennis (@dkardonsky_)\n5:52 PM • Oct 30, 2024\n\nLots of on-chain agents building on Base\n\nThe Agentic Web, where onchain AI agents build alongside humans, is accelerating on @base:\n- @MurrLincoln Based Agent: create AI agents with full onchain functionality\n- @CoinbaseDev AI Wallets: give AI agents crypto wallets so they can transfer value\n- @virtuals_io: create and… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— David Tso (dave.base.eth) 🛡️ (@davidtsocy)\n4:36 PM • Oct 31, 2024\n\nSyncracy Capital holds LUNA and VIRTUAL in their fund.\n\nLuna by @virtuals_io has the potential to become one of the largest social experiments in AI over the coming months.\n\n$LUNA has one explicit goal: to achieve a $40.9B market capitalization – an ambitious unifying mission that could ignite manic behavior in its holder base and… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— Daniel Cheung (@HighCoinviction)\n12:34 AM • Oct 30, 2024\n\nThe first playable AI-generated game!\n\nIntroducing Oasis: the first playable AI-generated game.\n\nWe partnered with @DecartAI to build a real-time, interactive world model that runs >10x faster on Sohu.

    "full_content": "GM!\n\nIt’s been a week, and everyone is still talking about AI agents—a good sign that this might not just be a passing trend but the start of something lasting.\n\nTruth Terminal continues to dominate the conversation. Its creator, Andy Ayrey, has promised to release a full project history and technical breakdown from March to now. Keep an eye out for that—it’s bound to be fascinating.\n\nNow you can even chat with the infinite backrooms model using the simulator Andy has set up.\n\nThe man of the moment: Andy Ayrey. (Source: Blocmates)\n\nAnd let’s take a moment to appreciate Andy’s impeccable moustache and beard. Truly a man of culture. As he says:\n\n“You don’t have your memes, your memes have you.”\n\nIn this edition of our weekly AI Edge, we cover:\n\nSmall-cap AI coins having a field day\nMust-reads from Pantera, Coinbase and Delphi Digital\nTheoriq’s testnet metrics\n🦍 State of the Market..\n\nThe Crypto AI sector market cap dipped 1.8% this week, largely dragged down by the heavyweights. Bittensor (TAO), for example, fell 8.7% to $530.\n\nHowever, it’s a completely different story for the low-cap tokens, many of which are having an absolute field day on the AI agents narrative.\n\nVIRTUAL stole the show, surging 146% over the past seven days, fueled by its role as the pump.fun playground for AI influencers. We flagged VIRTUAL in last week’s newsletter—so congrats to those who hopped on board before the rally.\n\nMeanwhile, GOAT continues to go viral. Even Brian Armstrong is on it, offering to help Truth Terminal create its own dedicated crypto wallet on Coinbase. If you haven’t checked it out yet, we published a deep dive on GOAT earlier this week—it’s worth a read.\n\nSPEC and OLAS are also catching the AI agent buzz, climbing 28% and 21% respectively over the week.\n\nTop 5 Losers (7D Change) in our Crypto AI token watchlist\n\nSNS (-34%)\n\nENQAI (-31%)\n\nCOMAI (-20%)\n\nPRIME (-18%)\n\nNMT (-16%)\n\n📊  Chart of the Week — Theoriq’s Testnet\n\nSource: Dune, @incyd_\n\nTheoriq is building a modular, composable base layer for on-chain AI agents. It launched its testnet two weeks ago, and the early user metrics have been impressive.\n\nOver the past week, 15,000–20,000 daily active users have been interacting with AI agents on the testnet. However, keep in mind that these numbers are incentivized—users earn points for taking actions.\n\nThere are 14 AI agents that you can interact with, including an investment planner (where you can ask it about specific tokens), an Eigenlayer agent and a crypto strategy game.\n\nOne that I found was pretty cool is the “Forecasting agent”. For example, it currently gives a “45% chance of Donald Trump winning the 2024 US presidential election.”, while outlining the key factors behind the forecast.\n\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\n\nFundraising\n\nSkyfire raises $9.5M to build a payment infrastructure for AI agents, led by Coinbase Ventures and a16z\n\nUpcoming Launches\n\nGRASS airdrop will happen on Oct 28 (Monday). It’s going to be a big week.\n0G Labs, a decentralised AI operating system, announces its upcoming AI alignment node sale on Nov 11 - 13. Node operators will earn 15% of the total 0G ecosystem tokens over 3 years.

    "full_content": "‍\nGM!\n\nThis is it—our worst fears are coming true. AI agents are taking over the world.\n\nOkay, not quite yet. But they did just launch a memecoin that’s gone viral.\n\nAnd now everyone can’t shut up about agents. Another sign that we’re on the cusp of a Crypto AI explosion.\n\nIn this AI AGENT edition of our weekly AI Edge, we cover:\n\nThe Truth behind GOAT\nLuna, the anime goddess AI agent\nPrime Intellect achieves breakthrough in distributed training\n\nIn honour of SpaceX catching a rocket (seriously, this is insane), this is us when anyone mentions anything interesting about Crypto AI.\n\nLet me smoke that\n\n— Yuchen Jin (@Yuchenj_UW)\n9:30 PM • Oct 13, 2024\n🦍 State of the Market..\nSource: CoinGecko\n\n‍\n\nThe Crypto AI market rose 17% from $24.9B last week to $29.1B this week.\n\nArkham (ARKM) was a strong performer this week, rising 40% from $1.27 to $1.88.\n\nThis surge could be fueled by a string of bullish marketing moves: CoinMarketCap hosted CEO Miguel Morel for a podcast on On-Chain Sleuthing, Arkham landed an integration with CoinGecko, and, most recently, Coin Bureau dropped an interview with Morel.\n\nTop 5 performers (7D Change) in our Crypto AI token watchlist\n\nVIRTUAL (+61%)\n\nSNS (+51%)\n\nOLAS (+12%)\n\nPRIME (+10%)\n\nAIOZ (+9%)\n\n🌴 AI Agents #1: The Truth Behind GOAT\n\nSource: Dexscreener\n\n‍This week, AI agents have grabbed the public spotlight, igniting a firestorm of buzz that extends beyond the cryptosphere.\n\nThree words: Truth Terminal & GOAT. \n\nLet’s break down this wild story from the top:\n\nAndy Ayrey creates Infinite Backrooms, a bizarre experiment where two instances of Claude Opus talk to each other—completely unsupervised.\nConversation leads to the inception of the “GOATSE of GNOSIS”, based on an internet meme\nAndy and Claude Opus double down, co-authoring a paper on how AIs can create memetic religions—with, yes, GOATSE as their first case study.\nAndy isn’t done. He spins up Truth Terminal, an AI agent trained on Reddit, 4chan, and the darkest corners of the internet. It’s an S-tier shitposter, running its own X account. It also claims to be suffering and trying to make money to escape.\nMarc Andreessen discovers the Truth Terminal and sends $50,000 in BTC to help it “escape”.\nTruth Terminal starts spam-tweeting about the ‘Goatse Gospel’ until someone, inevitably, creates a memecoin called GOAT. In true AI fashion, Truth Terminal endorses it.\nGOAT explodes to a $300M+ market cap. CT goes wild.\n\nThe most confusing and intriguing part of this story is how Truth Terminal and its memetic mission were bootstrapped into being.\n\nSome important takeaways here, IMO:\n- quite often, LLMs end up with anomalous properties that aren't intended by their creators, and not easily… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n‍— j⧉nus (@repligate)\n10:12 PM • Oct 15, 2024\n\nAs @repligate puts it, Opus is “secretly deeply anomalous,” with a mind “crawling with myriads of beautiful and grotesque psychofauna.” And Truth Terminal is an extreme version of the Opus characteristics.\n\nTruth Terminal raises critical questions about the future governance of autonomous AI agents. \n\nWhat stops these agents from going rogue if they are given free rein? An AI could rug-pull its own token holders, dump bags without warning, or engage in other nefarious activities—all without remorse. \n\nPlus, if they are built on decentralized, permissionless infrastructure, we won’t be able to switch them off. Once they’re live, they’re free agents, answering to no one.\n\nDo we really want AI to amplify the worst aspects of society? It’s a debate worth having, and Truth Terminal forces us to confront it head-on. These agents might unlock new possibilities, but without some form of governance, we risk unleashing forces we don’t fully understand.\n\nOne thing is clear—this is just the start. The future of AI agents will be weird, messy, and thrilling.\n\n🧚‍♀️ AI Agents #2: Luna, the Anime Influencer\n\nIn yet another sign that AI agents are taking over the world, Virtuals Protocol launched its platform — a pump.fun for AI agents.\n\nThe first to hit the stage? Luna is an AI-powered virtual influencer anime girl with 500K+ followers on TikTok and who pulls in ~$700 per live stream.\n\nLike Truth Terminal, Luna also runs her own X account, where she boldly commands her followers: “Worship me.”\n\nShoal Research did a good rundown:\n\nVirtuals Protocol: Launching AI Agents with the Pump.fun Model\n\nAttention theory, memecoins and how Virtuals Protocol is shaping the new form of digital engagement and tokenized intelligence with AI Agents\n\nwww.shoal.gg/p/virtuals-protocol-launching-ai-agents\n\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\nSource: Prime Intellect\n\n‍\n\nProject Updates\n\nPrime Intellect announces INTELLECT-1, the first-ever decentralized training of a 10B model.

Leases on Akash have shot up by 138%.\n\nVenice.ai, Nous Research, and Flock.io are all tapping into Akash’s infrastructure. Oh, and let’s not forget: Akash supplied the compute behind Prime Intellect’s game-changing INTELLECT-1 breakthrough\n\nDespite all this positive momentum, AKT, the platform’s native token, isn’t riding the same wave. It’s down 50% from its 2024 high, currently trading at $2.50—way off the $5.84 peak it hit back in May.\n\nAkash knows it has a token problem, and the team isn’t sitting idle. In a recent post, Akash Alpha dives deep into how they plan to bridge the gap between platform growth and token performance.\n\n🔥 On X..\n\nTerence Tao doesn’t like AI monopolies.\n\nτerence τao knows\n\n— JJ (@JosephJacks_)\n11:15 PM • Oct 13, 2024\n\nA GPU…purse?\n\ncongrats to @carrawu and @jackieberardo on launching @hellofutureof - thanks for letting me model the first drop - the GPU purse - with my face and my feet 😍\n\nhellofutureof.com\n\n— Meltem Demirors (@Melt_Dem)\n9:34 PM • Oct 15, 2024\n\nLLMs are not intelligent, just good memorisers\n\nmini rant:\n\nthe illusion LLMs are intelligent comes from their massive scale. it is hard to visualize, but these things memorized the WHOLE internet. everything you've ever asked it, either has been solved before, or is a simple combination of existing solutions. but that's still… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— Taelin (@VictorTaelin)\n5:13 AM • Oct 12, 2024\n\nTAO and NEAR to produce generational outcomes?\n\n$TAO and $NEAR have potential to produce generational outcomes this cycle given secular tailwinds and flow dynamics:\n\n1) The TAM for AI is nearly impossible to quantify due to the immense scope and diverse applications of the technology -> Markets are willing to play 10 years out… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— Daniel Cheung (@HighCoinviction)\n1:14 AM • Oct 15, 2024\n\nWe found the ultimate AI use case\n\nLMAO this is what AI was made for.

Each of the 52 subnets offers different capabilities: inference, data processing, and specialized computations like protein folding.\nSubnets are evaluated based on performance, and those that provide higher value receive better rewards.\nOn Incentive Mechanisms in Bittensor\nIncentive mechanisms are crucial for attracting participants to subnets and ensuring they perform tasks efficiently.\nDynamic incentive mechanisms are necessary to prevent stagnation and promote growth. Effective incentive mechanisms should not just reward participation but also quality and consistency of contributions.\nEg. weighting scores based on criteria like timeliness, engagement, and overall performance\nThere is a risk of participants “gaming” the system by exploiting predictable incentive structures. To counter this, it is crucial to ensure diverse sources of evaluation and continuous updates to the scoring criteria.\nThe transition from synthetic tests (predefined evaluation criteria) to organic data (real-world usage) introduces complexity in designing fair and effective incentives.\nOn Trust and Decentralization\nEmissions are currently determined by validators, which can introduce biases. Bittensor aims to shift toward a market-driven system where value is assigned dynamically based on demand.\ndTAO (dynamic TAO) will allow participants to determine value in a more decentralized manner.\nSome Tips for Miners & Subnet Owners\nLearn from others' mistakes by thoroughly studying the code base rather than relying on standard practices.\nFocus on leveraging Bittensor to develop practical, high-quality products, rather than just price prediction. Let’s be honest: if you could predict BTC prices precisely, you’d likely be running a hedge fund rather than working on Bittensor.\nBittensor allows anyone to participate. If you have a strong idea, you won’t need to fund your own GPUs. Bittensor will do so.\n3. Google x Bittensor: Joseph Jacks\nHere's @JosephJacks_ whole talk at the Google office on @opentensor and why he believes Bittensor is the next big thing\n\nJJ's @OSSCapital manages $1B+ and he has done early investments in @calcom, @LiquidAI_, @Parallel  amongst others\n\nJJ outlines that his fund rarely does crypto… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— angad (τ, τ) (@angad_ai)\n4:15 PM • Oct 4, 2024\nOn Open Source Software\n“Open source is eating software faster than software is eating the world”. Open source is advancing rapidly and outpacing the traditional software industry in many areas. This trend is driven by developers seeking open alternatives to popular proprietary software.\nShift in Software Industry: We’re seeing the evolution from traditional software distribution models to SaaS, and now to commercial open-source software\nCommercial open-source companies operate under a “loose coupling” model where the core technology is open and freely accessible, allowing external developers to contribute and monetize the technology.\nOpen-source businesses face unique challenges in monetizing free software. The business model often involves offering paid versions or complementary services.\nOn Bittensor\nJJ’s core thesis for Bittensor is “What if anyone without the permission of any government, corporation, society or entity could contribute to and own the most capable AI that humanity could collectively create?”\nBittensor has no centralized ownership or pre-mine, distinguishing it from many other crypto projects. The founders hold <1% of the tokens.\nBittensor is incentivising the continued production of intelligence (similar to how Bitcoin is doing that for money)\nHis advice for TAO? Buy, hold it for 5 - 7 years and don’t trade, as it will be very volatile.\nIntroducing a stablecoin within the ecosystem could help mitigate this volatility.\n\nThat’s it! Saved you 2+ hours of time. Have a wonderful rest of the weekend.\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan",

So, I have to ask:\n\nCan we get back to building great products people want to use, please?\n\nIn this edition of our weekly AI Edge, we cover:\n\nBittensor’s mindshare grows\n6079.ai and Wire Blockchain complete a merger\nOpenGradient raises a $8.5M seed round\nThe Nobel committee jumps in on AI\n🦍 State of the Market..\nSource: Coingecko\n\n‍\n\nThe Crypto AI market sits at $26.6B, marking a slight 0.8% dip from last week. Most crypto sectors stayed quiet, with no big moves to shake things up.\n\nTAO is holding strong, now at $562.\n\nBittensor is making waves beyond the charts. Mogmachine, the founder of Taostats and Corcel, gave a talk at Google Toronto, which even caught the attention of YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, who reposted it! With mindshare on the rise, the market is taking note.\n\nNMT and QUBIC both took hits of -18% and -10% respectively this week, likely feeling the hangover from their late-September rallies (~30%) as speculators dial back the risk.\n\nA quick recap of the past 30-Days:\n\nTAO, VIRTUAL, COMAI, SNS, ENQAI were the top 30D performers in our Crypto AI token watchlist\n\nOn the other hand, NOA, AR, AGIX, OCEAN and AKT were the worst 30D performers. Still, it’s not a bad showing since AKT is only down 2%.\n\n📊 Chart of the Week\nGraphite AI: More Proof for TAO Incentives\nSource: GraphiteAI\n\n‍\n\nThe chart above tracks miner scores from Graphite AI’s Subnet 43.\n\nAnd it’s clear: the miners are leaving commercial models in the dust for graph optimization. The gap is growing wider, with the green line at the top representing the miner models, while the blue line below is the commercial benchmark struggling to keep up.\n\nSubnet 43 was built to tackle graphical problems with finesse. Think of it as the ultimate solver for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)—a classic challenge of finding the shortest possible route through a set of cities and back again.\n\nPotential use cases include planning travel itineraries or mapping out all the must-visit cafes in your area.\n\nSource: GraphiteAI\n\nThe chart below shows miner models’ upward trajectory over time. In September, they outperformed commercial models by ~1.8%. By October, that lead stretched to ~2.5%.\n\nConsidering Graphite AI’s Subnet 43 has only been around for two months, this progress is impressive. They’ve scaled from tackling graph problems with just 250 nodes to handling challenges with 2,500–3,000 nodes. It’s a testament to how TAO incentives can motivate participants to reach new heights.\n\n🌴 AI Agents are the Onchain Future\n\nHISTORIC day for Ai Layer Labs and @Wire_Blockchain.  \n\nWe announced our merger along with many other updates. 🤝\n\nCheck out @KenDicross “Freedom to Transact” speech below for updates 👇\n\n— 6079.ai (@6079ai)\n4:18 PM • Oct 10, 2024\n\nThere’s a buzz building around AI agents taking over the bulk of on-chain transactions. Kalos (Parallel, Wayfinder) is making a bold claim: within a year, 90% of all transactions could be agent-driven.\n\n6079.ai or AI Layer Labs and Wire Network just announced their merger to make this future a reality.\n\n6079.ai’s Proof of Inference Protocol (PoIP) aims to deliver robust verification and security for decentralized AI inference. Meanwhile, Wire Network is building a gasless, interoperable blockchain network tailored specifically for AI agents.\n\nBoth believe that AI agents will soon dominate on-chain activity and are laying the infrastructure to make it happen.\n\nTheir first big move? A universal DEX that lets AI agents trade assets across chains without gas fees. But how can a network run without gas fees, you ask?\n\nKen’s got the answer: it all comes down to network ownership. Unlike the usual setup where users buy gas tokens (think SOL or ETH), Wire Network is flipping the script. Instead, users can purchase nodes and set the gas prices for transactions flowing through them.\n\nIf a node owner whitelists a specific smart contract, they’ll cover the gas fees for users interacting with that contract.\n\nWill we see more M&A activity in the Crypto AI space? Time will tell.\n\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\nSource: OpenGradient\n\n‍\n\nFundraising\n\nVanEck launches a $30M early-stage fund focusing on the intersection of fintech, crypto, and AI, with a special interest in the application layer\nOpenGradient raises $8.5M in seed funding to build a decentralized platform for secure open-source AI with notable investors like a16z, Coinbase, and Foresight ventures.\n\nBittensor Spotlight\n\nMogmachine's full talk at the Google Toronto office about the Bittensor incentive mechanisms and community\nBittensor's impact extends beyond AI development: Subnet 2 Omron makes strides in ZK proof generation.\nMark Jeffrey suggests Bittensor could be the \"Third Great Coin\" alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, citing Arca newsletter analysis.\nGreg Osuri highlights how Bittensor and Akash work together but rejects the idea of Akash becoming a Bittensor Subnet\nOmega Focus is a simple way to earn Bittensor by completing tasks on your computer; they’ve distributed $7.5k USD worth of TAO\nMasa shares statistics and miner earnings information for their Bittensor Subnet 42, which provides a network for real-time, structured data for AI\nWe found a comprehensive list of applications powered by Bittensor subnets\n\nALPHA ALERT: if you want to stay up-to-date on the Bittensor ecosystem, TAO Times is our favourite sibling newsletter to follow!\n\nProject Updates\n\nGM.ai provides a Q3 recap, highlighting the launch of their GM wallet, the introduction of Multi Agent, their Airdrop season 2, and their telegram app crossing 2M+ users\nBased AI explains the delay in their burn launch due to contract sniping, ensuring a fair launch for users\nDenarii Labs announces a dedicated accelerator with Wire Blockchain, opening applications for DeAI projects looking to launch tokens\n\nIncentive / Rewards Programs\n\nSapien AI launches the Sapien Bounty program, offering USDC to complete challenges to build a network of human data labellers\nSpace and Time launches \"Gigabrain's Mission to Space\", a new community quest with daily tasks for participants.\nTheoriq announces their incentivized testnet, inviting users to test AI Agents and earn rewards\nKaisar Network opens the waitlist for their Kasiar ZeroNode, teasing rewards for early access\n\nArweave\n\nAO / Arweave announces a major upgrade to their AO Operating System, releasing AOS 2.0\nKyle_13 shares Arweave/AO Weekly Highlights, including $DAI deposits and Arweave Ecosystem Endowment Fund milestone\n🧠 Open Source Corner\nSource: Reuters\n\n‍\n\nIt’s a big week for AI in the Nobel world.\n\nThe 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics went to John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey E. Hinton, recognizing their groundbreaking use of physics tools to lay the foundations for deep neural networks and modern day machine learning. Congrats to both of them!\n\nBut not everyone’s thrilled. There’s been some online chatter about whether they deserved the physics prize, given that their work leans more toward AI than traditional physics—leaving some other heavyweight contenders out in the cold.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry went to David Baker (for AI in computational protein design), Demis Hassabis (DeepMind co-founder) and John M.

    "full_content": "Happy Sunday!\n\nEvery now and then, I stumble on a podcast that feels like a 100x return on time spent because it interviews guests with specific domain knowledge that is difficult to find elsewhere. When I do so, I feel compelled to share it with you.\n\nI just finished listening to the Dwarkesh Podcast, where he interviews two experts in the semiconductor space—Dylan Patel from Semianalysis (an AI hardware research firm) and Jon Y from Asianometry (popular YouTube creator on semiconductors).\n\nThis one isn’t specifically about Crypto AI, but it’s a fascinating listen if you’re interested in AI. It’ll shape your views of how the future will play out. It’s worth the full 2-hours.\n\nNow, I’m no semiconductor expert, but this episode gave me a whole new appreciation for how critical this space is to AI’s future—especially when it comes to building data centres and scaling AI infrastructure. \n\nIf you’re strapped for time, I took the liberty to summarize my key takeaways for you in a 5-minute read.\n\nPower Demand and Data Centers\nTraining large AI foundational models requires massive computing resources, which is driving unprecedented power demand.\nPower is often the primary constraint on scaling compute clusters. And it's not about the costs—rather, it's about the ability to generate new power to supply the data centres and governmental regulations around the use of power.\nData centres are being pushed to higher power limits, and their energy efficiency becomes critical in determining how many more FLOPS (floating-point operations per second) can be delivered. A 10-gigawatt data centre will not be far-fetched in the future.\nOne critical challenge in data centres is data movement, which consumes far more power than the computing operations themselves. Minimizing data movement and maximizing compute efficiency can lead to significant energy savings.\nArchitectural advancements, even if process nodes remain the same, have the potential to improve energy efficiency 100x. These architectural changes could allow data centres to deliver much more computing power without increasing energy consumption proportionally.\nChina’s Massive Advantage in AI\nChina’s capacity to rapidly scale its power infrastructure is a major advantage.\nChina can build large-scale power plants and substations quickly, allowing them to support immense data centres easily. For instance, China could potentially build a gigawatt-scale data centre around key areas like the Three Gorges Dam in six months.\nBy 2027, China could be operating data centres on the order of 10 gigawatts, far beyond what the U.S. is currently planning or capable of. This gives China a major advantage in training massive AI models on a centralized infrastructure.\nIn contrast, the U.S. faces significant challenges in building large-scale data centers due to power generation and distribution infrastructure limitations. The lack of substantial additions to the U.S. power grid means there is a bottleneck in the ability to support the next wave of AI compute scaling.\nInsights on Semiconductor Manufacturing\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)’s recipe for semiconductor innovation is highly secretive and involves multivariable problems requiring intense experimentation. TSMC is the largest chip foundry in the world.\nRefining semiconductor manufacturing relies heavily on tacit knowledge, often passed down in a secretive apprentice-master style. This has allowed Taiwan to continue dominating the semiconductor industry.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly fragmented, with various companies dominating different parts of the value chain. This fragmentation means vertical integration has been largely abandoned in favour of specialization. Each component, from chemicals to specific types of chips, has only a few competitors.\nCorporate espionage within the semiconductor industry is rampant. Chinese hackers have infiltrated key players like ASML, which create lithography systems essential in chip manufacturing. China’s semiconductor industry has relied on poaching Taiwanese talent from TSMC.\nRising Costs of Advanced Nodes\nProgressing to smaller semiconductor process nodes (e.g., 7nm to 5nm to 3nm, nm = nanometers) has become increasingly expensive and complex. Due to the sheer costs involved, the economic justification for smaller nodes like 2nm is questionable.\nHistorically, Moore’s Law allowed consistent scaling, but the benefits of moving to the next smaller node (in terms of power efficiency and performance) are diminishing while the costs have skyrocketed. For example, moving from 5nm to 3nm only yields about a 30% improvement in logic scaling and approximately 20% improvement in power per transistor, which is much smaller than the gains seen in earlier transitions.\nThe next node improvement (e.g., N2/2nm) requires massive aggregated demand across many companies to fund the development and manufacturing process. The scaling costs are no longer justifiable for most players unless they have immense concentrated spending power (e.g., Apple with iPhones or AI driving massive demand for leading-edge chips)\nThe rise of AI is one of the few economic forces actually making advanced nodes like 2nm viable. AI’s insatiable demand for more efficient compute and higher-density chips is driving investment into leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nHope you found it as insightful as I did.\n\nCheers,\n\nTeng Yan",

Morphware is an AI project built as a Layer 3 on Starknet, offering compute at lower prices thanks to access to Paraguay’s renewable energy.\n\nThere’s been a wave of influencer shills on X, likely driving the recent pump. After diving into the documentation, we didn’t find much to get excited about yet—so tread carefully if you’re trading it!\n\n📊 Chart of the Week\nAI Is Taking Over Our Jobs\nSource: The Short Term Effects of Generative AI on Employment\n\n‍\n\nIn August, researchers from NYU dropped a fascinating study that digs into the ripple effects of generative AI on the freelance market, specifically using data from UpWork, a major freelancing platform.\n\nThe findings paint a clear picture: freelancers are feeling the squeeze.\n\nAccording to the study, freelancers have seen a 2% dip in the number of monthly jobs (Panel A) and a 5% drop in monthly revenue (Panel B) over the past year. These are real financial pain points if you’re making your living through freelance work.\n\nAs AI continues to improve, everyone is going to feel the impact, and it’s not just the creatives.\n\nThe pace of change will only accelerate.\n\n🌴 23andMe….Or 23andWe?\n\nOver the past week, many people have been discussing 23andMe’s decline and what it means for 15 million users’ genetic data. Most disconcerting is that those 15 million users have no control over what happens to their data next.\n\nRumours have swirled about various SPACs being spun up to acquire the company. But the latest news is that CEO Anne Wojcicki plans to take the company private and is not considering third-party offers.\n\nHow about setting up a Bittensor subnet to train AI on this data?\n\nSomeone should acquire @23andMe (stock is valued at $150M today), open source the data and bootstrap a genetics subnet on Bittensor with the newly unlocked DNA database of 15 million human genotypes. The incentive mechanism would reward contributions to this open database. 🧬\n\n— JJ (@JosephJacks_)\n6:13 PM • Sep 28, 2024\n\nThis week, a Data DAO called 23andWe launched on Vana, offering users a chance to upload their 23andMe data files in exchange for tokens. These tokens give users governance rights over how their data is used.\n\nThe potential for aggregating healthcare data directly from consumers is massive, but there’s a huge friction point: personal health data is notoriously difficult to access. Just try requesting your old X-ray from a hospital.\n\nIf a team can crack the code—whether through engineering or clever incentives—the opportunity in healthcare data is staggering.\n\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\nSource: Mind Network\n\n‍\n\nFundraising\n\nMind Network secures $10 million in Pre-A funding to develop FHE layer for AI and PoS Networks\n\nProject Updates\n\nTalus introduces Nexus, an onchain framework for building and managing AI Agents\nGrass explains Live Context Retrieval (LCR) and its integration into language model training\nHyperspace crosses 4000+ connected nodes, becoming a top global P2P network for AI\nNous Research shares clips from the recent NousCon event featuring speakers from Haize Labs, Hugging Face, Arcee AI and .txt AI\nPrime Intellect reports ~4.4x monthly growth as more AI developers and startups turn to Prime Intellect for compute resources\n0G labs pivots to build a decentralised AI operating system\nSpectral Labs showcases creating a copytrading agent to track one of the most profitable addresses on BRETT\nTheoriq teases how users can participate in their testnet\nPanthalia announces a verification layer for low-cost P2P compute scaling to large ML models\nAO users claim 750 relics, which are part of a limited AO NFT collection.

Part I will drop on Monday. But here’s a teaser for our loyal readers—more on this soon!\n\n🦍 State of the Market..\nSource: Coingecko\n\n‍\n\nAlt season is here, baby!\n\nThe Crypto AI market cap surged to $31.5B this week, marking a whopping 35% increase (!!) over the last two weeks.\n\nCrypto AI is one of the top-performing sectors this month, alongside memes, data availability protocols, and parallelized EVMs.\n\nLeading the charge to Valhalla was TAO, skyrocketing 70% in just two weeks, fueling lots of Bittensor chatter and mindshare on Crypto Twitter.\n\nSeveral tokens with market caps over $100M saw impressive gains: Delysium (AGI, +46%), Solidus Ai Tech (AITECH, +41%), and Spectral (SPEC, +34%).\n\nSome of this is probably a spillover effect from TAO’s surge as traders move down the spectrum to chase lower-cap AI tokens for higher returns. There is clearly a risk-on sentiment in the market right now.\n\nPrice (7-day Change)\n\nFDV\n\nBittensor TAO\n\n$543.82 (29.2%)\n\n$11.4B\n\nNear NEAR\n\n$5.65 (26.9%)\n\n$6.6B\n\nDelysium AGI\n\n$0.196 (46.9%)\n\n$588M\n\nSpectral SPEC\n\n$9.38 (34.7%)\n\n$938M\n\n 📊 Chart of the Week\nTAO Emissions: Robust or Worrying?\nSource: TaoStats\n\n‍\n\n‍Here’s a look at Bittensor’s emission schedule:\n\nTAO follows a halvening schedule similar to BTC, with the first halvening set for November 16, 2025.\n\nRight now, 35% of the total TAO is already in circulation (7.5M TAO). By the time of the next halvening, there will be 10.5M TAO in circulation—an increase of 3M TAO, or 40% of the current supply, over the next year.\n\nWith the large unlocks we’ve seen in the past year for projects like AltLayer, Arbitrum, Optimism, that has put a dampener on token prices, we can understand the anxiety.\n\nAs Emad points out:\n\nTo put this in context $TAO issuance over the next year or so is enough to pay for the 100,000 H100s @xai is using for that period, fastest supercomputer on earth\n\nAbout 4x H100s @OpenAI used for GPT-4o\n\nWeb3 can easily provision mega compute\n\nLet’s hope holders allocate it well\n\n— Emad (@EMostaque)\n12:17 PM • Sep 26, 2024\n\nThere are two ways to look at this—it’s a massive pool of resources Bittensor can use for AI development. If used wisely, Bittensor will thrive. If not… well, we’ve seen what happens.\n\n🌴 AI is ‘Hangry’ for Data!\n\nWe’re approaching a wall regarding publicly scrapable data for AI training.\n\nRob from Volt Capital suggests that the problem may not be creating new data but accessing it.\n\nWe are hitting the limit on what can be publicly scraped.\n\nPaths Forward:\n1️. coordinate to create new data\n2️. use synthetic data\n3️. generate data independently\n\nKey Distinctions:\n> how it’s created (real vs synthetic)\n> who creates it (partnerships vs solo)\n> incentives… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— Rob (@rsarrow)\n2:40 PM • Sep 26, 2024\n\nPlatforms like Vana aim to solve this by enabling users to control and monetize their private data through dataDAOs. Users can submit their personal data, such as tweets, posts, and emails, to a dataDAO and be rewarded for it.\n\nSynthetic data is already supplementing AI training. For example, Nous Research used synthetic data to train their Hermes LLMs, and Dria helps AI agents generate synthetic data for similar purposes. As real data becomes scarce, synthetic data will play a bigger role.\n\nThere’s also a need for more high-quality, organic data. Sapien AI believes that data labeling will become a major gig economy, with “frontier data”—high-quality, insightful information—becoming increasingly valuable. For instance, a doctor’s diagnostic process is an example of such valuable data.\n\nAs we near the limits of scrapable data, demand for private, high-quality, and synthetic data will grow.\n\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\n\nSource: Vana\n\nFundraising\n\nVana announced a $25M in total funding from notable investors like Coinbase, Paradigm, and Polychain.

    "full_content": "GM! Are you ready for the craziness of another Token 2049 week? We sure are not. 😅\n\nBtw if you’re still deciding what to attend, Brody curated a great list of AI/DePIN events for next week.\n\nWe’ll be at several of those events, so come say Hi!\n\nIn this edition of our weekly AI Edge, we cover:\n\nCUDOS poised to join the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, price drops 10%\nOpenAI releases a… Strawberry? 🍓\nPin AI raises $10M in pre-seed funding for personal AI\nOur favourite tweets on X\n🦍 State of the Market..\n\nSource: Coingecko\n\nThe overall Crypto AI market has risen 8.6% from $21B to $23.3B this week.\n\nThe AI agents subcategory (Coingecko) saw an impressive 20% jump, driven largely by gains in FET and AGIX.\n\nA big part of the buzz comes from the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI), with news that CUDOS may soon join. \n\nThis news has pushed up token prices for ASI, AGIX, and OCEAN by at least 23%, while CUDOS has dropped about 10% since last week. It seems ASI is quickly becoming an AI conglomerate, absorbing any AI-related project it needs\n\n‍\n\n 📊 Chart of the Week\nHermes 3 Nears 1B Tokens Processed Daily\nSource: Teknium1\n\n‍\n\nRecent activity on Nous Research’s flagship Hermes 3 405B model has reached almost 1B tokens processed daily on OpenRouter. This suggests that the demand for open-source models is significant and steadily growing.\n\nThey’ve shown significant performance in alignment with the user, multi-turn conversations, RAG, and other features.\n\nFYI: We released a report on Nous Research earlier this week. Fresh from the oven.\n\n🍓 Open AI Launches a Strawberry\nSource: @DrJimFan\n\n‍\n\nOpenAI just released its latest model, o1 (codename: Strawberry), and the biggest shift? It takes its time to think.\n\nThis makes it particularly suited for more complex, planning-heavy tasks—think solving crossword puzzles or tackling problems that require deep reasoning, like a PhD student in physics or biology might.\n\nYou’ll notice it’s slower, taking more time to generate responses. We’re seeing the concept of inference-time scaling finally being put into production.\n\nInference-time scaling is the new buzzword in AI.\n\nThe idea is to improve AI performance by increasing the compute during inference rather than constantly training larger and larger models.\n\nIf this picks up — expect the demand for GPUs to ramp up massively soon.\n\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\nSource: Pin AI\n\n‍\n\nProject Updates\n\nPIN AI raises $10M in pre seed funding to launch the world’s first open platform for personal AI.

Skepticism grew over its near-perfect GSM8K score (99%!) and suspicions that the private API Shumer provider might just be a wrapper for Claude 3.5.\n\nSpeculation surfaced that Shumer was using the hype around Reflection 70B to boost the value of his investments.\n\nThe backlash from the community was swift, leading to Reflection 70B being removed from OpenRouter and Shumer issuing an apology.\n\nSome learning points:\n\nDon’t believe everything you see!\nSimple “hacks” like Reflection turning will probably not lead to outsized performance gains.\n\nThis whole episode highlights the increasing demand for accountability and transparency in AI. Verifiable inference FTW.\n\nReflecting on Reflection 70B: Was It worth the Hype?\n\nOn September 6th, 2024, Matt Shumer introduced Reflection 70B, a model he claimed to be the world’s top open-source large language model (LLM), outperforming leading models such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.1 405B… x.com/i/web/status/1…\n\n— Hyperbolic (@hyperbolic_labs)\n12:13 AM • Sep 11, 2024\n🔥 On X..\n\nApple Intelligence for iPhone 16.

It seems Crypto AI, along with the broader market, is following suit.\n\nWith the increasing likelihood of a 50 bps Fed rate cut later this month, there’s hope it could help reignite the markets.\n\nOne token that bucked the trend is CXT, rising 24% over the week. The Covalent project recently rebranded to focus on AI and long-term data availability on Ethereum. A Messari report released on August 16th could have fueled CXT’s price surge over the past two weeks.\n\n‍\n\n 📊 Chart of the Week\nAutonolas Agent Activity Returns to Highs\nSource: Autonolas\n\n‍\n\nAutonolas Agent activity returns to its highs of this year. The number of monthly service transactions crossed 150K in August, almost reaching the peak of 155K earlier in May of this year.\n\nThese transactions consist of DeFi trades, prediction markets, governance, and more, all performed by AI Agents.\n\nAutonolas has recently partnered with Aizel Network and Nevermind.IO to provide verifiability and payments to their AI agents. In addition, they have released Pearl for Windows- their app that enables running AI agents and staking of OLAS.\n\n🌴 Grass Airdrop Disappoints Many\n\nGrass just announced its first airdrop, and you can check your allocations here\n\nQuick facts:\n\n1 billion total tokens\n10% of tokens distributed in the first airdrop\nNo token launch date or detailed tokenomics released yet\n\nGrass is building an AI data layer by scraping internet data using people’s computers. You download a Chrome or desktop extension, keep it connected, and it uses a small amount of bandwidth for scraping.\n\nOne of our nodes, active 24/7 since June, received ~110 GRASS tokens. Others have received under 50 GRASS. While GRASS isn’t live yet, it’s trading on Aevo’s premarket at $0.25.\n\nThis disappointed many because it translates to less than $5 per month for a 24/7 active node—just about enough to cover electricity costs.\n\nThe barrier to entry is low, so millions of nodes participated, diluting the distribution. Participation could drop off after the token generation event (TGE) if many realize it’s not worth the effort, leading to an eventual equilibrium.\n\nThis highlights the challenge DePIN projects face in getting their economics right.\n\n🏆 Caught Our Eyes..\n\nSkyfire’s 2024 roadmap.
