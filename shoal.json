Launched in March 2024, Sonic has achieved what few Web3 projects have managed to achieve: genuine mainstream user adoption through its TikTok-native game SonicX, which provides a seamless entry point for traditional social media users into Web3 gaming.\n\nJust as OP Stack enabled Coinbase's Base and other major platforms to build on Ethereum, Sonic is doing the same for Solana - but with a gaming-first approach. Through its HyperGrid framework, Sonic is enabling major gaming studios and platforms to launch their own customized Solana chains while maintaining the security of the base layer.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research! Subscribe to receive new research and support our work.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSonic is the gateway via which thousands of Web3 games enter the ecosystem. Combining Solana’s speed with the customizability of Sonic, which is building the SVM L2 for gaming apps, It is able to achieve such a feat. Sonic uses the Hypergrid framework, which is a scaling framework that is a key piece of technology in Sonic’s modular future, which enables Sonic to have optimized functionality and performance. It does all these by allowing the customization of chains’ features and advanced data types.\n\nThe modular architecture of Sonic allows developers to easily customize the perfect blockchain economy while achieving Solana's fast throughput. HyperGrid is a scaling framework for SVM ecosystem. Sonic provides natively integrated tools for payment and settlement infrastructure, as well as user engagement tools necessary to build a successful Web3 game.\n\nKey benefits that make creators and developers build on Sonic include :\n\nSonic gives users an insanely fast on-chain gaming experience powered by the Solana virtual machine(SVM) at a minimal cost.\n\nSonic allows for the execution of transactions without redeploying Solana programs and accounts, as it benefits from the base layer liquidity and services.\n\nSonic provides native composable gaming primitives and extensible data types based on the Unity ECS framework on-chain.\n\nSonic provides sandbox utilities for developers to build their business logic.\n\nSonic provides in-house infrastructure for growth, traffic, payment, and game settlement.\n\nThe Social Platform Playbook: From TON to TikTok\n\nTON proved that embedding Web3 into trusted platforms works. Through mini-apps within Telegram's messaging ecosystem, games like Hamster Kombat (300M users) and Notcoin (150M users) reached millions of users who had never touched crypto before. The key insight from this is that users will embrace Web3 when it feels like a natural extension of their daily experience rather than a separate crypto product.\n\nSonic takes this proven model to TikTok – a platform with over 1 billion users and unmatched engagement metrics. Where TON focused on Telegram's messaging-first audience, SonicX targets TikTok's entertainment-native users, who are already primed to discover and engage with new content.\n\nSonicX\n\nTikTok, the popular social media platform for creating, sharing, and discovering short videos, boasts over 1 billion users as of 2024. Known for its unmatched reach and engagement, TikTok offers incredible potential for amplifying content. SonicX, a TikTok mini-application launched by Sonic, leverages this platform to expand the reach of Web3 gaming to TikTok's vast and engaged audience. This strategy not only enhances the visibility of Web3 games but also provides significant returns on investment for Sonic and its gaming partners by capitalizing on TikTok's extensive user base.\n\nWhy TikTok Mini Apps\n\nThe vision behind launching SonicX on TikTok is to cultivate a Web3 gaming layer that’s accessible and engaging for mainstream audiences. TikTok’s popularity among KYC-verified users offers unique insights into user preferences, creating a powerful environment for Sonic’s games to gain traction. Through a well-curated user flow, SonicX is building a path for new Web3 gamers to easily explore and enjoy blockchain-powered games, seamlessly integrating with their existing TikTok experience.\n\nThis strategy - meeting users on their preferred platform rather than asking them to venture into unfamiliar territory - mirrors the proven TON's success strategy while targeting a much larger opportunity. TikTok's billion-plus users and unmatched engagement metrics offer the potential for Web3 gaming to finally reach true mainstream adoption.\n\nIntroducing SonicX: The Hub for TikTok Web3 Gaming\n\nSonicX is the cornerstone of the TikTok initiative, bringing games directly to users and setting an example of what’s possible within a TikTok Mini App. It links the TikTok credentials to crypto wallets and simplifies the onboarding process, making it easy for users to access rewards and engage with on-chain activities without leaving TikTok. This streamlined user flow positions SonicX as the go-to hub for Web3 games on TikTok, offering users a quick and intuitive way to explore blockchain gaming.\n\nSonic’s Web3 applayer, SonicX, reached a major milestone of 1 million KYC-verified users on November 7, 2024, and now has over 2 million users, marking a pivotal achievement in Web3 adoption through TikTok. This milestone underscores Sonic’s commitment to building robust infrastructure and a user-friendly distribution platform. Through SonicX, the TikTok native game built on Sonic SVM, users can easily discover and interact with a wide range of Web3 games, all within the familiar environment of TikTok. SonicX team fully utilized account abstraction, creating a seamless, simplified onboarding for non crypto-native users. On the backend, a Solana wallet is automatically generated - but for users they do not need to leave the TikTok app, logging in with their TikTok account to play the games offered on SonicX.\n\n\"Achieving 1 million KYC-verified users is a testament to Sonic’s dedication to bridging the gap between mainstream social media and Web3. SonicX was designed with accessibility and engagement in mind, and we’re proud to have created an experience that brings the benefits of blockchain technology to a large, active audience on TikTok.\" said Chris Zhu, Co-founder and CEO of Sonic.\n\nThe Applayer’s unique features, including an aggregation page for Web3 games, an interactive leaderboard for SonicX’s flagship tap-to-earn game, and a task page where users can complete activities for rewards, have all contributed to this substantial growth. These tools foster a rich, rewarding environment for users, positioning Sonic as a leader in both Web3 gaming and social media engagement. With this milestone, Sonic SVM reinforced its commitment to innovation and user engagement, paving the way for a broader adoption of Web3 and decentralized technologies. Sonic continues to build upon this success, with further plans to enhance the Applayer’s capabilities and integrate additional applications that empower users in the Web3 space.\n\nStrategic Partnerships and Growth\n\nCapitalizing on this growth, Sonic has landed its first major gaming partnership with Mahjong Verse (formerly Mahjong Meta). Backed by prominent investors Dragonfly and Folius, Mahjong Verse's decision to build on Sonic signals a growing confidence in TikTok as a viable Web3 distribution channel.\n\nMahjong Verse will be prominently featured on SonicX's game discovery page, serving as a blueprint for how traditional games can successfully transition to Web3 while maintaining their core appeal. Through SonicX's user-friendly features, including:\n\nA simple tap-to-earn game mechanism that makes blockchain interaction intuitive\n\nA centralized hub for discovering and engaging with Web3 games\n\nA comprehensive task system where users complete challenges to earn points.\n\nInteractive leaderboards that drive engagement\n\n\"Our partnership with Mahjong Verse represents a significant step forward in our mission to make Web3 gaming accessible to mainstream audiences,\" says Chris Zhu, CEO at Sonic. \"By combining our technical infrastructure with their innovative gameplay, we're creating new opportunities for TikTok users to engage with blockchain gaming in a seamless, user-friendly way.\"\n\nThis collaboration showcases the potential of Sonic's two-pronged approach: robust technical infrastructure through Sonic SVM, paired with frictionless distribution through the SonicX platform. For traditional game studios watching from the sidelines, it offers a compelling roadmap for entering Web3 without sacrificing mainstream appeal.\n\nBut Sonic isn't stopping at gaming. Sonic recently announced a strategic partnership with Injective to build a cross-chain Smart Agent Hub. This collaboration connects Solana and Injective ecosystems, enabling AI agents to operate seamlessly across both chains. By leveraging Sonic's HyperGrid technology with Injective's powerful WASM-based blockchain, they're creating an infrastructure that could reshape how AI agents interact with blockchain games and applications.\n\nThis hints at a more significant shift in how the industry thinks about blockchain adoption. The \"if you build it, they will come\" era of Web3 might end. Instead of asking users to leave their comfort zones, why not bring Web3 to platforms where billions already spend their time?\n\nIt's still in the early days, but the strategy is worth watching. If Sonic can continue converting TikTok's massive user base while attracting more established studios, they might have cracked the code that's eluded Web3 gaming for years: genuine mainstream adoption without the usual blockchain learning curve.\n\nWhy Sonic is the \"OP Stack of Solana\"\n\nThe rise of Layer 2 solutions has transformed blockchain scalability. On Ethereum, OP Stack emerged as the definitive solution for enterprises building their own chains, powering Coinbase's Base, Zora, and dozens of other platforms. Each of these chains maintains Ethereum's security while optimizing for specific use cases - from NFT marketplaces to social platforms.\n\nSonic is bringing this same transformative potential to Solana, but with key architectural differences, making it uniquely powerful for gaming applications. Sonic’s distinctive edge comes from combining mainstream user accessibility with powerful blockchain infrastructure.\n\nBut why an L2 on Solana? Part of the “innovation” behind Solana’s architecture is its memory-mapped file storage vs. the traditional storage trie with key-value mapping (Ethereum et al.), which means no global state trie and instead a flat structure of accounts. This, plus the account ownership model, allows Sealevel to process transactions in parallel.\n\nThen, looking at it from first principles, the need for an L2 or a rollup on Solana stems at the account level (not globally) — meaning when we get hotspots (due to Solana’s flat state model). For example, an on-chain market maker doesn’t want to compete with priority fees on the L1 just to land a transaction in time, nor should a game have to spend more to record the state of a game — since this would lead to the business not being profitable. Thus, moving the accounts of a DeFi protocol to a rollup or that of a game would make sense. With Sonic SVM, This is enabled by Hypergrid, a scaling framework on Solana that employs a multi-grid approach where each grid operates semi-autonomously while anchored to the Solana mainnet for consensus and finality.\n\nSonic’s transactional model is specifically designed to meet the needs of gaming, enabling high-frequency, low-latency interactions essential for in-game events, player actions, and state updates. Sonic offers native composable gaming primitives and extensible data types directly based on the Unity entity component system (ECS) framework.\n\nThis framework is a data-oriented framework that is compatible with game objects. It scales the processing performance, enabling experienced creators to build more ambitious games with an unprecedented level of control and determinism. Although the Sonic protocol is known for its gaming potential, it can still be used to develop decentralized applications (DeFi) and physical infrastructure networks (DePIN).\n\nWhile Sonic's initial focus is gaming - evidenced by its success with TikTok integration - its infrastructure extends beyond games. The protocol can support various decentralized applications (DeFi) and physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), similar to how OP Stack evolved beyond its initial use cases. This positions Sonic not just as a gaming platform but as a fundamental piece of Solana's scaling solutions.\n\nFor Web3 gaming to work on TikTok's scale, you need infrastructure designed specifically for that challenge. This is where HyperGrid, Sonic's scaling framework, plays a crucial role. Just as OP Stack provides the technical foundation for Base and other Ethereum L2s, HyperGrid enables TikTok-scale gaming on Solana.\n\nWhat are Hypergrids?\n\nHypergrid is a rollup scaling and orchestration framework for dedicated Solana virtual machine ecosystem rollup operators. It utilizes state compression and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) to achieve potentially infinite transaction throughput by enabling horizontal scaling across multiple grids, exemplified by Sonic, a gaming-specific grid that settles on Solana.\n\nSolana’s main strength lies in composability, where one application can easily integrate with another app using the same shared ledger. Sonic aims to ensure an atomic state synchronization strategy between Solana L1 and Hypergrid.\n\nA key feature of HyperGrid is atomic interoperability. Hypergrid is designed to be interoperable with Solana as it implements an interoperability interface that allows for wholly encapsulated programs on Solana to delegate execution to grids orchestrated by Hypergrid. This approach has some benefits, including:\n\nIt creates a single source of truth for all programs running on Solana.\n\nIt facilitates the delegation of program computation to hypergrid.\n\nIt enables rollups to benefit from the Base layer's services and liquidity.\n\nHypergrid has two core components which enable it to work :\n\nGrids - Grids are configurable SVM rollups for optimized performance.\n\nHypergrid Shared State Network(HSSN) - This is an interoperability layer for grids, and it serves as a consensus layer that seeks to securely roll up state transitions to Solana.\n\nHow HyperGrid Powers TikTok-Scale Gaming\n\nThe real innovation in HyperGrid comes from how it handles the massive amount of data and transactions that social platform gaming generates. Rather than trying to put everything directly on Solana's mainnet, HyperGrid uses compressed accounts - a way of storing game data that's both secure and efficient.\n\nThink of it like this: every action in a TikTok game - whether it's scoring points, earning rewards, or updating leaderboards - is represented as a compressed account. These accounts are programmable, meaning games can customize how they work, but they don't take up expensive blockchain space. Instead, HyperGrid uses concurrent Merkle trees to track all these actions efficiently.\n\nCompressed Accounts\n\nWhen a TikTok user plays a game on SonicX, each of their actions is represented as a compressed account in Sonic's rollup system. These accounts, implemented through program-derived addresses (PDAs), are fully programmable and customizable while being orders of magnitude more efficient than traditional on-chain storage. Instead of maintaining expensive account tables with exact addresses, Sonic's architecture only needs to track the deterministic inputs used for account derivation - a perfect match for high-frequency gaming interactions.\n\nIn Sonic's implementation, each account is uniquely identifiable through its cryptographic hash in the state tree. When players trigger state changes - whether that's updating scores, collecting rewards, or modifying game assets - these changes propagate through the hash chain, ensuring data integrity. Under the hood, RPC nodes index these compression programs and maintain the concurrent Merkle tree structure, enabling games to efficiently read from and write to this compressed state without sacrificing security.\n\nThis architecture is what allows SonicX to support millions of concurrent user interactions while maintaining Solana-level security guarantees. Every gaming action, from the smallest score update to complex multi-step transactions, is represented as a compressed leaf in the state tree, with only the 32-byte root hash stored on-chain. It's this technical foundation that makes TikTok-scale Web3 gaming not just possible, but economically viable.\n\nConcurrent Merkle Trees\n\nTraditional Merkle trees have been a cornerstone of blockchain technology, providing an efficient way to verify data in peer-to-peer networks. They work like a pyramid of hashes: at the bottom, you have individual transaction hashes (leaf nodes), which pair up to form branches, ultimately combining into a single root hash at the top.\n\nImagine four players making moves simultaneously (transactions A, B, C, and D). Each action gets its own hash (Hash A through D). These hashes pair up - A with B, C with D - creating intermediate branches (Hash AB and CD). These branches then combine to form a final root hash (Hash ABCD), which serves as a cryptographic fingerprint of all the gaming activity.\n\nBut traditional Merkle trees face critical limitations when dealing with TikTok's volume. In high-throughput environments like Solana, validators receive updates rapidly — often multiple changes within the same slot. Traditional trees process these changes in series, meaning each subsequent update could fail as it invalidates the previous root hash and proof.\n\nThis is where Sonic's concurrent Merkle trees shine. Instead of processing changes one by one, they maintain a smart \"changelog buffer\" on-chain. Think of it as a high-speed memory system that tracks recent changes, their root hashes, and proofs. When multiple players take actions in the same slot, this buffer serves as a source of truth, allowing up to maxBufferSize simultaneous updates to the same tree. For TikTok gaming, this means thousands of players can interact simultaneously without transactions failing.\n\nPractical Implementation in Sonic\n\nIn Sonic's protocol, every gaming interaction is stored as a leaf in this concurrent Merkle tree structure. Whether earning points, updating leaderboards, or collecting rewards, each action becomes part of the state tree. But here's the efficiency gain: instead of storing every piece of data on-chain, only a compact 32-byte root hash needs to be stored. The system uses zero-knowledge cryptography to compress the validity proofs of all these gaming actions into a tiny 128-byte proof.\n\nThis architectural choice is what enables Sonic to handle TikTok's massive scale while maintaining Solana's security guarantees. Games can process thousands of player actions per second, all while keeping blockchain storage costs minimal and verification efficient.\n\nBuilding on Sonic SVM\n\nDevelopers interested in launching their games can do so on TikTok via SonicX, which offers a robust infrastructure to make it happen. With Sonic Origin and Sonic Frontier networks available, games can be deployed easily through the guides.\n\nSonic framework supports wallet integrations, like OKX, Backpack, and Nightly Wallet, ensuring users have seamless access to in-game assets and blockchain functionality. Sonic provides good infrastructure for developers who plan to deploy apps via Sonic on tiktok, some of the support Sonic provides are :\n\nNetwork Support: Easily deploy games on Sonic networks, with specific guides for Solana-based developers.\n\nEmbedded Wallet Connection: Integrate wallet connections via Sonic embedded H5 iframe solution.\n\nMobile Optimization: SonicX is optimized for mobile, ensuring the majority of users enjoy an effortless experience.\n\nCampaigns and Promotions for Sonic Games on TikTok\n\nTo accelerate adoption and support games launching on its platform, Sonic has rolled out several key initiatives.\n\nThe Sonic Odyssey campaign integrates new games into its incentivized testnet, giving developers immediate access to over 2 million active users, along with dedicated PR and social media exposure.\n\nOn the marketing front, Sonic is heavily investing in TikTok's ecosystem, combining targeted advertising with strategic influencer partnerships. This two-pronged approach helps games reach both casual players and dedicated Web3 users.\n\nTo incentivize early adoption, Sonic has also created exclusive prize pools using Sonic Rings, rewarding users who discover and engage with new games through the TikTok platform.\n\nBuilding Solana's Application Layer\n\nWhat started as a solution for TikTok gaming is evolving into something much broader. Just as OP Stack grew beyond Base to power diverse applications on Ethereum, Sonic is emerging as a fundamental piece of Solana's application layer. The recent partnership with Injective to build a cross-chain Smart Agent Hub demonstrates this evolution – where gaming is just the first of many use cases.\n\nThis expansion mirrors an important pattern in blockchain infrastructure. TON began by powering simple Telegram mini-apps but grew into a complete ecosystem. Similarly, Base started as Coinbase's L2 but now supports everything from NFT marketplaces to DeFi protocols. Sonic is following this trajectory, but with a crucial difference: it's building with social platform integration as a core feature, not an afterthought.\n\nThe staking ecosystem provides early validation of this broader vision. Through partnerships with Solayer and Adrastea, Sonic has accumulated over $140 million worth of staked SOL, becoming the largest actively validated service (AVS) on Solayer. This demonstrates how Sonic's infrastructure can extend beyond gaming to support fundamental blockchain services.\n\nLooking ahead, the launch of the $SONIC token further accelerates this expansion. With 57% of the supply allocated to community and ecosystem development, Sonic is building an economic model that incentivizes social platform integration and technical infrastructure development. This dual focus—making blockchain accessible through platforms like TikTok while providing robust technical infrastructure—positions Sonic uniquely in the Web3 landscape.\n\nThink of a small game studio launching its first Web3 title on SonicX. Or a DeFi protocol scaling effortlessly with Sonic’s HyperGrid framework. Or even a TikTok creator using $SONIC rewards to build a stronger connection with their audience.\n\nWhat's Next for Sonic\n\nThe Web3 gaming landscape has seen many ambitious projects, but adoption has remained elusive. TON showed the first glimpse of a solution through Telegram mini-apps, proving that bringing Web3 to existing social platforms could work. Sonic took this insight further, targeting TikTok's billion-plus users instead of Telegram's messaging-first audience.\n\nWith over 2 million KYC-verified users, partnerships (like Mahjong Verse and Injective) and Sonic's TikTok-first strategy have validated this approach. The platform's success demonstrates that Web3 adoption doesn't require users to leave their comfort zones—instead, blockchain functionality can be seamlessly integrated into platforms they already use daily.\n\nLike how OP Stack evolved from powering Base to enabling a whole ecosystem of applications, Sonic is expanding its reach. The recent partnership with Injective to build a cross-chain Smart Agent Hub hints at this broader vision - where gaming is just one of many applications running on Sonic's infrastructure.\n\nThis two-pronged approach - social platform integration paired with robust technical infrastructure - positions Sonic uniquely in the Web3 landscape. While other chains struggle with the gaming trilemma of speed, cost, and decentralization, Solana's core architecture gives Sonic a natural advantage. Games can tap into Solana's sub-second finality and negligible fees while maintaining decentralization - crucial factors for any mainstream gaming application.\n\nWeb3 gaming proved the perfect testing ground, demanding both technical excellence and mainstream appeal. As traditional platforms explore Web3, they all face the same challenge: maintaining a seamless user experience while adding blockchain functionality. Sonic's approach of meeting users where they are, built on Solana's robust infrastructure, may well be the blueprint others follow.\n\nFAQs\n\nQ: Can game developers access end users’ TikTok usernames, follower counts, IP addresses, and other data?\n\nA: Developers can obtain users' TikTok usernames with user authorization. For other data, please refer to the TikTok API documentation. IP addresses can be obtained through landing pages directly.\n\nQ: How is user session data stored?

Through relentless efforts from the team and a strong long-term vision, Jito has grown from near zero in TVL in January 2023 to become the largest protocol by TVL on Solana, with over $3.54 billion in TVL, representing around 32% of Solana’s total TVL of $10.73b.\n\nOn top of that, Jito also played a key role in the rebirth of Solana by rewarding its core users with one of the largest airdrops in Solana’s history. This happened at a time when it was needed the most—following the FTX debacle and when the consensus thought that Solana was a dead chain.\n\nToday, Jito continues to be at the forefront of technological innovation on Solana and is once again introducing a new key product that could bring the chain a step closer to its end goal: Jito (Re)staking.\n\nIn this report, we will explore Jito (Re)staking, covering the underlying concept of restaking, Jito's core offering, its potential market opportunity, and the full ecosystem surrounding it.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research! Subscribe to receive new posts and support our work.\n\nSubscribe\n\nRestaking 101\n\nRestaking was originally pioneered by EigenLayer and first launched on the Ethereum mainnet in June 2023. The core idea behind restaking is to enhance the security and reliability of decentralized services (what EigenLayer refers to as AVS or Actively Validated Services) by allowing them to leverage the economic security of one main consensus layer rather than relying on their own potentially weaker security models.\n\nWhile smart contracts and their interactions benefit from the security of the main Layer 1 chain, other components like oracles, bridges, sequencers, or Layer 2 solutions require their own economic security models. This means either raising significant capital to incentivize validators or compromising on security. Therefore, even if smart contracts are secured by a strong decentralized consensus network, vulnerabilities in other parts of the workflow—such as an oracle providing incorrect data—can undermine the integrity of the entire system. This presents a paradox: there’s little value in having strong security at the smart contract level if other parts of the system aren’t equally secure, as, ultimately, it is the weakest link that determines the overall security and resiliency of a system.\n\nRestaking addresses this issue by allowing staked assets to be reused across multiple decentralized services where validators who have already proven their reliability on a base layer (like Solana or Ethereum) can extend their security guarantees to additional protocols. This creates a hierarchical security model where:\n\nBase Layer Security: The underlying blockchain provides the foundational security layer through traditional staking.\n\nExtended Security Coverage: Through restaking, this security is extended to additional protocols, which EigenLayer terms \"Actively Validated Services\" (AVS) and what Jito calls \"Node Consensus Networks\" (NCNs).\n\nEconomic Alignments: Validators are incentivized to maintain honest behavior across all networks they secure, as malicious actions could result in slashing of their stakes across multiple protocols.\n\nWhile there are still many technical and risk challenges that must be overcome for restaking to achieve its end goal of creating a more interconnected, secure, and efficient blockchain ecosystem, it represents a key innovation in blockchain security and scalability. In fact, it has already generated significant attention from both builders and investors.\n\nAs mentioned, the restaking narrative first gained prominence with EigenLayer on Ethereum, which has accumulated over $15 billion in TVL since its launch. This success has inspired similar innovations across other ecosystems, with protocols like Symbiotic and Karak, each securing over $1.75 billion and $816m in TVL, respectively. This trend is now beginning to replicate on Solana, with Jito recently releasing the full code for its own restaking protocol: Jito (Re)staking.\n\nJito (Re)staking — The next big thing on Solana?\n\nAt its core, Jito (Re)staking represents the backbone technology for its next-generation hybrid and highly flexible restaking protocols on Solana. The architecture introduces a framework that turns security from a fixed cost into a programmable resource – one that can be shared, optimized, and monetized across multiple protocols simultaneously.\n\nThe Jito (Re)staking framework consists of two main components: the Restaking Program and the Vault Program. We can think of them as two separate technological entities that work together to provide a flexible, multi-assets, and scalable infrastructure to enable restaking on Solana.\n\nOn the one hand, the main function of the Restaking Program is to coordinate the creation and management of Node Consensus Operators (NCNs), facilitate opt-in/opt-out mechanisms, and manage reward distribution and slashing penalties. On the other hand, the Vault Program is focused on everything related to liquid restaking tokens, or as Jito calls them, Vault Receipt Tokens (VRTs), and their customization and delegation strategies.\n\nThis design allows partially decentralized protocols on Solana— especially those that previously relied on centralized systems — to fully decentralize their operations and be secured under a unified layer of economic security. All of that is done without having to build all the costly and complex infrastructure by themselves as they fully rely on the Jito (Re)staking stack.\n\nThe architecture advantage\n\nJito (Re)staking stands out through its modular, three-layered architecture:\n\nNode Operators (NOs): Node operators are entities that manage, validate, and secure the infrastructure for NCNs. Here, what sets Jito's approach apart is its capital efficiency—operators can secure multiple NCNs simultaneously, maximizing their infrastructure utilization. The current roster includes industry leaders like Figment, P2P, and Kiln, who collectively secure billions across multiple chains.\n\nFor example, Figment, which manages staked assets across chains, can now use the same infrastructure to validate Switchboard's oracle data and Squads’ policy network. This reduces operational overhead while maximizing returns.\n\nNode Consensus Networks (NCNs): NCNs are protocols that leverage Jito's restaking network to secure and validate their actions, transactions, and other types of information by plugging into Solana's existing security infrastructure rather than building it from scratch. These protocols can range from oracle networks and cross-chain bridges to novel DeFi applications.\n\nTake Sonic's gaming SVM - instead of bootstrapping their own validator set, they plug into Jito's existing network for transaction validation. Similarly, Twilight's privacy network uses this layer to secure their operations without building separate infrastructure.\n\nVault Receipt Tokens (VRTs): VRTs are synthetic tokens similar to liquid staking tokens, except that VRTs represent an IOU for a restaking position. Following this, Jito's key innovation is its multi-asset vault system. While other restaking protocols typically accept only native tokens or liquid staking derivatives, Jito enables the restaking of any SPL token.\n\nThis flexibility opens new opportunities for token utility and security bootstrapping. VRTs are managed by independent providers that are responsible for minting the liquid restaking tokens, as well as delegating and selecting NCNs.\n\nTo draw a parallel, the Jito (Re)staking technology as a whole can be thought of as the EigenLayer of Solana, while the VRT providers are similar to EtherFi in the sense that they act as the intermediary and a liquidity layer between users and the core restaking protocol. From a market perspective a lot of the value captured by Jito (Re)staking is expected to flow to those providers.\n\nHow Jito (Re)staking Works\n\nTo better understand how Jito (Re)staking works, let's use an example where Bob deposits his tokens into a Vault Receipt Token (VRT) from a provider like Kyros, Renzo, or Fragmetric. In return, Bob receives VRTs (kySOL, ezSOL, fragSOL or bzSOL), representing liquid tokens for his restaked assets. VRT providers then delegate Bob’s assets to professional node operators, securing multiple NCNs and generating yields from various sources. These rewards flow back to VRT holders like Bob, creating theoretically uncapped yield potential.\n\nThis means that by holding VRTs, Bob is able to earn higher APY rewards than if he simply staked his assets (as he is also securing multiple NCNs). Additionally, since VRTs are liquid, Bob can also use them in other DeFi applications, like providing liquidity on Kamino and potentially earning even higher rewards.\n\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that VRT and restaking as a whole comes with added risks for holders related to composability, the potential for slashing, and the complexities that arise in the management of restaking positions and their risk profiles. Even if this sector is really promising, it is still nascent, especially on Solana, and we have yet to witness how all of this will work in practice. This will be something important to monitor as this field grows.\n\nThe Jito (Re)staking ecosystem\n\nJito (Re)staking is still in its early stages but has already attracted significant players to its ecosystem, including NCN, Node Operators, VRT providers, and even DeFi integrations exploring the potential of restaking. Here's a full map of the Jito (Re)staking ecosystem to date:\n\nMajor NCNs\n\nAs of writing, six main NCNs are involved in Jito (Re)staking:\n\nSwitchboard: Switchboard is a permissionless oracle on Solana integrating Jito (Re)staking to enhance the security and performance of its services. Through this restaking integration, Switchboard leverages Jito's customizable staking and slashing parameters to ensure the integrity of its data feeds.\n\nSonic: Sonic is the first Solana Layer 2 for sovereign games, built with HyperGrid, the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) horizontal scaling framework. This project leverages Jito (Re)staking to enhance the security and efficiency of its SVM, supporting a multi-use ecosystem for gaming, DeFi, and other applications on Solana.\n\nSquads: Squads is the leading multisig solution on Solana, used by major teams and protocols to secure on-chain assets. It is integrating Jito (Re)staking for its upcoming Squads Policy Networks (SPN), a decentralized service designed to enhance the functionality of the Squads Protocol on Solana and the SVM.\n\nLeaf: Leaf Protocol is a decentralized platform designed to improve scalability and security for DeFi applications through secure, multi-network interoperability. By integrating Jito (Re)staking and the Node Consensus Network (NCN), Leaf fortifies its validator security and enhances staking rewards using JitoSOL.\n\nPing Network: Ping Network is a privacy layer protocol on Solana that allows anyone to contribute hardware and monetize unused bandwidth. This project utilizes Jito (Re)staking's Node Consensus Network (NCN) model to enhance the decentralization and economic security of its services.\n\nTipRouter: The TipRouter NCN is a Jito initiative developed to decentralize and secure MEV tip distribution on Solana by leveraging Jito (Re)staking. This proposal enables node operators to reach a consensus on distributing MEV tips, with 3% allocated to the Jito DAO treasury and NCN participants. It strengthens DAO control over validator security while establishing a transparent and robust mechanism for managing network rewards.\n\nMarket traction of Jito (Re)staking\n\nAs of today, the total TVL in Jito (Re)staking stands at 719K SOL, equivalent to around $167M, and it is currently at maximum capacity. This is shared between the three VRT providers: Renzo, Fragmetric, and Kyros.\n\nTotal TVL in Jito (Re)staking + market share of each VRT providers\n\nIn terms of distribution, Fragmetric is currently the most widely held VRT, with 21,368 holders. Kyros follows with 3880 holders, while Renzo is less distributed, with a total of 2075 holders.\n\nIn January, the TVL across all the VRTs got lifted up, and we can expect the TVL cap to be lifted in the future, too. This could lead to an inflow of capital to the different VRT providers until the industry reaches its full market potential.\n\nPotential market opportunity\n\nTo assess the market opportunity for Jito's restaking once caps are lifted, we can use a set of assumptions and draw parallels with Ethereum’s restaking market share.\n\nFirst, we could assume a conservative estimate of Solana’s Total Value Locked of between $10 billion and $13 billion on average for the next two years.\n\nIf we then assume that restaking on Solana could capture a market share similar to Ethereum's restaking market, which currently accounts for 27% of its TVL, and use a range of 20% to 30%, then it implies that the potential market size for restaking on Solana could fall between $2 billion to $3.9 billion (as shown in the table below).\n\nFor now, the only real Jito competitor in the Solana restaking market is Solayer, which currently has a TVL of around $465M. While Solayer is currently benefiting from the “first mover advantage,” we could argue that Jito’s deeper integration with Solana’s core infrastructure, existing validator network, and proven track record in driving innovation position it to outpace competitors over time. Hence, it seems reasonable to assume that, in the long run, Jito (Re)staking could easily capture between 40% and 60% of the entire Solana restaking market. Based on these assumptions, Jito (Re)staking could represent a market opportunity of over $1 billion to $2.1 billion within the next two years (as shown in the table below).\n\nFor now, the only VRT competitors are Kyros, Fragmentric, and Renzo. This means the market opportunity is likely going to be spread among those three and implies that the most successful VRT providers have substantial growth potential ahead.\n\nJito (Re)staking ecosystem strategies\n\nAs we’ve seen, the potential market for Jito (Re)staking is substantial. From a user perspective, this presents a goldmine of DeFi opportunities on Solana, especially considering how early we are in this new trend. Here are some of the main ones worth exploring:\n\nRestaking using one of the VRT Providers\n\nThe first and most straightforward DeFi strategy is to participate in restaking through one of the main VRT providers.\n\nThe main benefit is clear: it enables users to earn a higher APY on SOL compared to standard staking, while also offering the chance to be early in a new DeFi sector on Solana. This can provide exposure to potential token incentive rewards from these projects. However, as we’ve already mentioned this can come with added risk for holders that are related to composability, the potential for slashing, and the complexities that arise in the management of restaking positions and their risk profiles.\n\nThat said, if a user wishes to get involved with VRTs, an important question to ask is: Which one should a user choose? While there is no definitive answer, understanding the main value proposition of each VRT can help analyze their potential risk-to-reward profile:\n\nRenzo\n\nRenzo is a veteran in the liquid staking arena, originally launched on Ethereum, where it has established a stronghold with a TVL of $1.13 billion. Renzo's foray into the Solana ecosystem with Jito (Re)staking marks a significant evolution in its cross-chain ambitions.\n\nThe protocol offers two distinct VRT options on Solana:\n\nezSOL: Accepts JitoSOL as collateral, focusing on Jito's MEV-enhanced staking ecosystem. Users familiar with Renzo can transition to Solana with tested systems backing their assets.\n\nbzSOL: Accepts Binance's BNSOL as collateral, expanding access to Binance's staking infrastructure\n\nTheir single-collateral approach for each VRT trades flexibility for security and simplicity. What sets Renzo's implementation apart is its seamless deposit process – users can deposit SOL directly and the protocol automatically routes to the optimal conversion path, whether through Jupiter's swap API or direct minting.\n\nThe protocol here on Solana integrates with Renzo's existing points system and $REZ token infrastructure. However, the existence of their $REZ token means fewer speculative opportunities compared to newer protocols. Renzo appears positioned for users prioritizing operational stability over potential token rewards.\n\nFragmetric\n\nFragmetric is a Solana-native VRT provider that stands out for its broader focus beyond Jito (Re)staking technology, acting as an aggregator of various restaking protocols on Solana. This is an ambitious project that is more tech-oriented than the others because it needs to build the architecture to aggregate different restaking technologies on the network. This adds complexity and potential risks to the project, but it could become a compelling protocol if successful.\n\nThe Token2022 extension implementation uses transfer hooks to track fragSOL wallet balances in real-time. This enables direct NCN reward claims through their interface without diluting user contributions. While Ethereum's LRT ecosystem struggles with AVS token dumping issues, Fragmetric's architecture addresses this from the start through their on-chain reward tracking system.\n\nTheir Normalized Token Program enables multi-asset support beyond JitoSOL. When users deposit LSTs, the protocol mints fragSOL based on pool metrics, then creates corresponding nSOL for restaking in Jito vaults. This architecture handles slashing events efficiently - if slashing occurs, the Jito Restaking Slasher can claim proportional LSTs from the Normalized Token Pool using the slashed nSOL.\n\nThe protocol also features an on-chain points system. Their LF(ra)G Campaign credits F Points to fragSOL holders in real-time without additional steps, maintaining complete transparency through their reward module.\n\nWhile fragSOL's current non-transferable status creates temporary liquidity constraints, Fragmetric's technical implementation demonstrates how restaking protocols can solve complex tokenomics challenges through architecture design rather than aftermarket solutions.\n\nKyros\n\nKyros is the only protocol that is Solana-native and fully Jito-aligned. The protocol also launched with direct stake/unstake functionality. This architecture makes it the most secure and liquid VRTs and optimizes for DeFi composability through single-asset specialization.Their implementation demonstrates how focused technical scope can enhance operational efficiency.\n\nIts strong support with SwissBorg places it in a great position to kickstart network effect and grow partnerships within the Solana ecosystem. Last but not least, the protocol also launched a quest-based XP system and a points program.\n\nEach protocol's technical architecture reflects different priorities in restaking implementation. Renzo prioritizes proven security measures through cross-chain compatibility and tested infrastructure integration. Fragmetric emphasizes technical innovation with multi-token support and advanced normalization mechanisms. Kyros optimizes for operational efficiency and security through single-asset specialization and streamlined DeFi integration.\n\nThese architectural differences create distinct risk-reward profiles for users based on their technical requirements and risk tolerance. The success of each approach will likely influence future VRT protocol designs on Solana and beyond.\n\nLP opportunities on Kamino\n\nThe VRT ecosystem extends beyond simple staking. For users seeking to optimize their yields, Kamino's liquidity pools offer an intriguing opportunity to stack multiple revenue streams while maintaining exposure to Jito's restaking infrastructure.\n\nWhat makes these pools particularly compelling is their risk profile. Since the paired tokens (VRTs and JitoSOL) track the same underlying asset, users face minimal impermanent loss - a rare characteristic in DeFi liquidity provision. This creates an opportunity to capture additional token incentive rewards from VRT providers without taking on significant new risks.\n\nAt the moment, only Renzo and Kyros offer liquidity pools. Here are the key characteristics of each:\n\nRenzo\n\nAt the time of writing, Renzo's ezSOL-JitoSOL pool has a TVL of $4.6M and generates 8.19% APY through a combination of Jito incentives and trading fees. Users earn this on top of their base staking returns, while also accumulating Renzo points for potential future benefits.\n\nLink: https://app.kamino.finance/liquidity/5TQHajVurbMnwieFUXNcABuwkjfGtYQAi5tRhXJDAqy3\n\nKyros\n\nKyros takes a similar approach with their kySOL-JitoSOL pool. The TVL in the pool is the highest between the two, at around $8M, which makes kySOL the most liquid VRT. Further, the pool is currently yielding 2.74% APY. Market participants also speculate about incoming Raydium incentives, which could boost returns further. The possibility of future Kyros token rewards adds another layer of potential value capture as the pool earns Kyros points.\n\nLink: https://app.kamino.finance/liquidity/5ESAmxob1RsTrMVt7oaqvyDVoo4eD1Ns7s2xWiK4RjMK\n\nKamino Lend\n\nKamino has recently expanded its lending offerings to include both ezSOL and kySOL in its Jito Market. This integration creates new opportunities for VRT holders to maximize their yield potential.\n\nThis new lending market has already seen significant adoption, with over 220K ezSOL ($63.17M) and 11.45K kySOL ($3.27M) supplied to their respective markets. Users can earn different types of rewards depending on which VRT they utilize - ezSOL positions are eligible for REZ token incentives, while kySOL users can accumulate Kyros points\n\nHowever, users should note that while looping strategies can amplify returns, they also increase the risk of liquidation during market volatility. The protocol utilizes a liquidation penalty range of 5.00% - 15.00% to maintain market stability.\n\nYield trading\n\nYield trading is another promising strategy for users who want to speculate on potential token rewards from VRT providers. This is similar to protocols like Pendle on Ethereum. While yield trading is still new to Solana, significant developments are underway, and the sector holds substantial potential.\n\nHow It Works:\n\nDeposit an Asset:\nA user deposits a yield-bearing asset, such as a VRT, into a yield trading protocol through a vault with a specified maturity date.\n\nTokenize the Yield:\nThe protocol separates the principal from the yield, issuing two tokens:\n\nPrincipal Token (PT): Represents the right to reclaim the principal asset at the end of the term.\n\nYield Token (YT): Represents the right to earn yield from the underlying asset during the specified yield period.\n\nTrading and Yield:\nBoth PT and YT can be traded independently. For example, users can sell YTs to speculate on future yields or retain PTs as a stable position on the principal.\n\nMaturity:\nAt the end of the yield period, PT holders can reclaim the original deposited asset, and YT holders cease to receive yield.\n\nExample:\n\nUsers deposit kySOL (or other whitelisted VRTs) for a fixed term, such as nine months. Upon deposit, two tokens are issued:\n\npSOL: Pegged 1:1 to the original deposit, representing the principal.\n\nySOL: A token that accrues staking yield generated by the deposit until maturity.\n\nThis enables more nuanced positions than traditional staking. Users seeking immediate liquidity can sell their ySOL while maintaining long-term exposure through pSOL. Yield hunters can accumulate ySOL at a discount if they expect higher future returns or potential token incentives. When the vault matures, PT holders reclaim their original deposit while YT holders finish collecting their yield.\n\nDifferent Protocol Involved\n\nThe yield trading landscape on Solana is expanding through a few distinct implementations, each approaching yield optimization differently.\n\nRateX: RateX won the Solana Renaissance Hackathon with their leveraged yield trading implementation. Backed by the Solana Foundation, they're building infrastructure for amplified returns through strategic stake management.\n\nCurrently offering markets across all major Solana restaking tokens - with kySOL (29.232% yield, 2x leverage, $397.7K TVL), and ezSOL (10.185% yield, 1x leverage, $59.1K TVL), all with 158-day maturity except sonicSOL at 66 days. The protocol aims to serve both retail and institutional traders in the VRT market through a high-performance trading environment, where positions can be leveraged up to 4x depending on the market.\n\nRateX Market Overview\n\nLearn more: https://x.com/RateX_Dex/status/1846876952533389694\n\nTwitter: https://x.com/RateX_Dex\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttps://rate-x.io/\n\nSandglass: Built by the Lifinity team, Sandglass is a yield trading protocol on Solana. The protocol offers three distinct strategies for kySOL with compelling yields: YT kySOL offering 177.34% in JTO rewards with a 24.51x Kyros points multiplier and 12.3x YT multiplier, LP kySOL generating 16.75% pool APY, and PT kySOL providing 28.53% fixed yield at maturity.\n\nThe protocol is noteworthy due to its integration with Kyros's point system, offering 2x points multiplier and 14.47% JTO rewards across positions. Despite being in beta, it has already gained significant attention due to its competitive yields and multi-token reward structure.\n\nLink\n\nLearn more: https://x.com/sandglass_so/status/1817910180878934242\n\nTwitter: https://x.com/sandglass_so\n\nWebsite: https://sandglass.so/markets\n\nExponent:\nExponent introduces fixed-rate trading mechanics to Solana's DeFi ecosystem. Their implementation focuses on stable returns rather than variable yields, creating new opportunities for risk management in yield trading.\n\nRecently integrated with KyrosFi, the protocol offers multiple yield strategies: their Liquidity vault earning 33.5% liquid APY (combining Kyros points, kySOL yield, and JTO rewards), and PT-kySOL offering 27% fixed APY until June 14th with position sizes up to 100 SOL.\n\n\nExponent has also implemented a points boost system offering up to 50.23% APY for SOL-Jito Restaking positions. Users can earn 2x Kyros Points and an additional 5,650 JTO rewards over the next month. As a newly launched, double-audited protocol with a clean UX, their primary innovation remains the fixed-rate infrastructure for yield positions, allowing users to either leverage points through YT tokens or earn fixed yields through PT tokens.\n\nLearn more: https://x.com/ExponentFinance/status/1857449901199954196\n\nTwitter: https://x.com/ExponentFinance\n\nWebsite: https://www.exponent.finance/income\n\nPye: Pye won the Solana Radar Hackathon with their forward-selling yield implementation. The protocol enables stakers to trade future yield streams, creating immediate liquidity for staked positions.\n\nThe protocol allows stakers to create zero-coupon bonds using whitelisted VRT deposits. For example, users can deposit ezSOL for a fixed term, such as nine months, and receive two tokens: pSOL, pegged 1:1 to the deposit, and ySOL, which accrues all staking yield until maturity. Both tokens are liquid and can be traded independently, providing stakers with immediate liquidity and greater flexibility in managing their positions before the maturity date.\n\nWhile still pre-launch, their architecture introduces new mechanisms for extracting value from staked assets before maturity.\n\n\n\nExample Implementation form Pye on X\n\nTwitter: https://x.com/pyefinance\n\nDeFi opportunity in Eclipse\n\nEclipse, Solana's first SVM L2 on Ethereum, has integrated ezSOL and kySOL, marking the beginning of cross-chain VRT adoption. This integration creates new opportunities for optimizing VRT positions across both ecosystems.\n\nUsers can bridge their VRT to Eclipse via Hyperlane. Within the Eclipse ecosystem, when users bridge their VRT to Eclipse, they can leverage DeFi opportunities in that chain to optimize yield and potentially benefit from token incentive rewards from the VRT Providers as well as other DeFi players like Bridge, Lending and Borrowing exchange and Eclipse itself. Indeed, Bridging VRT to Eclipse enables users to earn Grass passively.\n\nLink\n\nSome of the potential future strategies include:\n\nLiquidity Provisioning (LP): For simpler strategies, users can LP their VRT with SOL on DEXs like Orca to earn trading fees. Further, those who seek cross-ecosystem exposure can pair their VRT with ETH or Eclipse’s Unified Restaking Token (tETH) on Orca to maintain a balanced position between ETH and SOL.\n\nCross-Chain Strategies: Those who seek cross-ecosystem exposure can also pair their VRT with ETH or Eclipse’s Unified Restaking Token (tETH) on Orca to maintain a balanced position between ETH and SOL. Further, Eclipse’s significant base of ETH-based assets allows for creative strategies. For instance, users can loop on Save by depositing VRT, borrowing USDC, and swapping to ETH. This creates leveraged spot exposure to both SOL and ETH while earning potential token reward incentive.\n\nStablecoin Minting: Soon, users will be able to mint decentralized stablecoins using VRTs as collateral on platforms like Neptune. This could unlock further new utility across the Eclipse ecosystem and even more rewards down the line.\n\nAutomated Strategies and Lending: Platforms like Leverage.fun might offer automated vault strategies and structured products to optimize returns. Moreover, cross-chain lending and borrowing of VRTs will also be enabled through protocols like EnsoFi, expanding capital efficiency for users.\n\nSynonym finance\n\nSynonym is a natively cross-chain lending market built on a hub-and-spoke model and powered by the Wormhole cross-chain technology stack. This means that with Synonym, users are able to earn, yield, borrow, repay, and withdraw from any chain, all from a single unified interface. For instance, someone can deposit on chain A, borrow on B, and repay/withdraw from C, D, etc. What that enables is a very powerful tool for maximizing farming/yields.\n\nSynonym is close to having its Solana integration live. When that happens, it could enable a lot of DeFi opportunities, first with Jito and then with the VRT Providers once integrated. Hence, users will soon be able to do cross-chain lending and borrowing with JitoSOL or other VRTs and benefit from the single unified interface to optimize yield opportunities in DeFi. As a second-order effect, this could also help users earn potential token reward incentives from Synonym as well as other DeFi partners, like the VRT Providers.\n\nFor instance, a user could deposit kySOL as VRT collateral on Solana and borrow ETH to participate in multiple other DeFi opportunities on EVM. Alternatively, a user could also deposit ETH to borrow SOL and engage with VRTs. This can help users optimize their DeFi strategy by maximizing yield and getting exposed of multiple layers of points program from different chains.\n\nTheir implementation has already demonstrated success with cross-chain strategies. For example, users have deposited weETH and ezETH as LRT collateral, borrowed USDC on Scroll, then used it with Ethena's sUSDe to earn significant SCR airdrop rewards.\n\nThe Solana integration will enable several key functions:\n\nJitoSOL deposits earning SYNO and partner incentives\n\nBorrowing against JitoSOL on any EVM chain\n\nCross-chain yield optimization with borrowed assets\n\nMulti-layer LRT point accumulation across chains\n\nSynonym recently launched their optimistic finality upgrade, reducing cross-chain borrowing latency while improving security. Their roadmap includes a complete app overhaul and tokenomics V2 launch within weeks, followed by full EVM <> SVM borrowing functionality.\n\nThis implementation could significantly expand VRT utility by enabling Solana's restaking assets to function as collateral across multiple EVM chains, potentially increasing demand for Jito's restaking infrastructure.\n\nWrapping up\n\nIn this piece, we’ve explored the potential of restaking on Solana and seen how, over the long run, this technology could make the Solana ecosystem more interconnected, secure, and efficient by extending the consensus layer of the main chain to other decentralized services. Market-wise, this represents a substantial opportunity.\n\nIn that sense, it seems that Jito, with its innovative (Re)staking technology stack, is well-positioned to lead this growth. Its robust architecture and established network effect, driven by its strong leadership within Solana’s DeFi ecosystem, make it a key potential player. But while Jito provides the backend technology, VRT providers are other crucial players in the staking stack, responsible for minting liquid restaking tokens, as well as delegating and selecting NCNs. Currently, the only VRT providers are Renzo, Fragmetric, and Kyros, and a lot of the value creation from restaking is expected to come from them.\n\nHowever, while the promise of restaking is substantial, it is important to note that it comes with added risks. These include composability issues, the potential for slashing, and the complexities of managing restaking positions and their risk profiles. Restaking, especially on Solana, is still in its early stages, and users should remain cautious and informed while experimenting with this new technology.\n\nLooking ahead, the integration of restaking into Solana’s ecosystem marks an important milestone. It opens the door to new DeFi strategies and a richer staking landscape, while also raising important questions about how the technology will evolve. Whether as an investor, developer, or observer, keeping an eye on these is an early chance to explore higher yields, dive into emerging projects, and potentially benefit from token rewards—all while watching a promising technology take its first steps.\n\nLiked reading this post?

This leads to hypergrowth and scale—what many call crypto composability. This composability allows for the creation of modular tech stacks where pieces can seamlessly fit in and out of the greater stack, driving unprecedented innovation. At the heart of this innovation lies the fundamental process of blockchain transactions, where the core value depends on a distributed network's ability to coordinate and agree on the system's state.\n\nWhen a transaction is sent on a blockchain, a distributed network of nodes must first verify its contents and then vote on the order of the transactions, making up the next block to be added to the chain. When these nodes agree, a state known as consensus is achieved. Blockchains originally implemented Proof-of-Work (PoW) for consensus, a mechanism involving specialized nodes called miners competing to be the first to solve an encryption puzzle to add new transactions and blocks to the chain.\n\nThough Bitcoin and a number of blockchains continue to utilize PoW consensus, a majority of blockchains today have shifted to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), adopting security through economic incentives rather than computational power. This concept was first introduced in the Peercoin whitepaper in 2012, which proposed a deterministic algorithm to select nodes based on the number of native network tokens the node operator has staked, favoring nodes with more capital.\n\nSubsequently, Jae Kwon wrote the Tendermint BFT whitepaper in 2014, which introduced a new mechanism to reach consensus as long as less than one-third of the nodes are faulty, and went live in action with the mainnet launch of Cosmos Hub in 2019. Besides consuming significantly less energy than PoW, a key strength of Proof-of-Stake comes from the fact that, similar to PoW, a stake cannot be easily forged. Furthermore, PoS incentivizes honest behavior by enforcing penalties on stakers who act maliciously through a process called “slashing”, which incurs financial losses to the validator.\n\nAs the adoption of PoS blockchains grew, participation in staking prompted new ideas about extending the utility of staked capital to benefit as many network participants as possible, from making staked capital liquid to bootstrapping security for new products and ecosystems.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

For the sake of this paper, this can be referred to as ‘vanilla staking’ given its core utility is limited to remaining idle in a smart contract, whereas other forms of staking offer extended utilities, which will be expanded upon further below. A validator’s stake size determines its likelihood of being selected to produce blocks, wherein a higher amount of capital staked is more likely to be selected. Technically anyone can participate as a solo staker, but blockchains do impose various financial and hardware requirements for doing so, which may not be easily accessible to the average network user or token holder. For instance, Ethereum requires a 32 ETH deposit and at least 16GB of RAM, a multi-core CPU, and a 1TB SSD to participate as a validator, while Solana requires 1.1 SOL/day for voting and at least 256GB of RAM, alongside a fast multi-core CPU and high-speed SSD storage.\n\nAs such, delegation mechanisms were formed to reduce these barriers to participation, allowing token holders to participate in staking with significantly smaller capital requirements and no hardware necessary while allowing node operators running validators to grow their stake allocation, thereby increasing their block rewards. A stake can be delegated directly to a validator or via stake pools, which are smart contracts that collectively pool funds to be delegated to multiple validators. Stake pools can be operated and held in custody by a third party (i.e., CEXs offering staking services) or non-custodial via decentralized on-chain protocols such as Rocket Pool on Ethereum or Jito on Solana.\n\nStaking also exists at the application level, wherein an application’s token holders can lock their tokens to secure the protocol (i.e, serve as a source of liquidity for covering the deficit in the case of a shortfall event on a borrowing and lending protocol), which typically earns the stakers rewards, plus additional utilities like governance rights or revenue sharing. This has even prompted various bribing markets in DeFi (i.e., Curve Wars) in which protocols would compete to accumulate a greater share of governance rights via tokens to receive a greater share of rewards in return.\n\nThat said, the simplicity of vanilla staking, a core part of its design, imposes a key limitation: staked capital that is locked up in smart contracts is illiquid, thereby diminishing the liquidity of the token and its broader ecosystem. The inherent lack of utility in vanilla staking hindered the adoption of staking services, as the rewards distributed to token holders would have to offset the price exposure risk associated with locking tokens up. A high volume of network activity could generate enough fees to provide organic returns to stakers, but this is often unsustainable and historically has not been the case across most PoS chains. Distributing rewards via native token emissions is a common alternative, but this, too, becomes unsustainable over a relatively longer period of time. This would lead to the development of liquid staking protocols.\n\nLiquid Staking\n\nLiquid staking emerged out of the need for a new mechanism that would allow stakers to retain the liquidity of their staked assets without compromising the security provided to the underlying protocol. This process functions similarly to vanilla staking to the extent that stakers deposit assets into a smart contract and earn a base yield for contributing to the underlying system. Liquid staking takes this one step further, however, by distributing a receipt token known as a liquid staking token (LST) to the staker, equal in value to that of the original deposit. This innovation demonstrated the importance of composability in DeFi, as LSTs could be used across various applications (i.e., liquidity provision, lending), ultimately enabling stakers to generate greater returns on their stake while growing the overall liquidity of the underlying network’s ecosystem.\n\nSince the first liquid staking protocols came around in late 2020, liquid staking has become the fastest-growing sector in DeFi, with over $42.3b in assets at the time of writing. Approximately 60% of this value belongs to the Lido Finance staked ETH (stETH) contract, and Ethereum is home to nearly 85% of total liquid staked assets in DeFi today. Solana’s numbers are far more modest, with just under $4B locked up in liquid staking protocols at the time of writing, 45% of which comes from Jito.\n\nOverall, liquid staking has brought about a great deal of flexibility and capital efficiency for stakers, which in turn benefited the underlying blockchains they were supporting as well as the ecosystems built on top of them. However, the utility of staked assets has naturally evolved with the development of blockchains. The rise of modular infrastructure and services has given way to a proliferation of new app-specific blockchains, who have historically struggled with bootstrapping their own validator networks due to a lack of activity and, therefore, economic incentive for participation. As such, new mechanisms were formed to extend the utility of staked assets to help secure and bootstrap new blockchains. This is what has come to be known as restaking.\n\nRestaking\n\nRestaking refers to the extension of one chain’s stake and validator network to secure any number of other chains. More formally, restaking can be defined as an adaptation of shared security in the context of Proof-of-Stake blockchains, wherein a security provider chain is servicing a security consumer chain, often through an intermediary referred to as a restaking protocol.\n\nThis mechanism enables new blockchains, whether they are application-specific or general-purpose, to bootstrap their security by leveraging the economic and computational resources of a larger base layer such as Ethereum or Solana. Stakers also benefit from improved capital efficiency; by securing multiple blockchains instead of one, stakers extend the utility of their stake to generate greater returns. However, it’s important to consider that securing multiple blockchains extends the slashing risk on the staked assets - this concept will be discussed later below.\n\nJust as anyone can either directly run a validator node on a Proof-of-Stake blockchain or deposit into a stake pool, anyone can participate in restaking through either native restaking, wherein the user operates a validator node that commits to a restaking module, or through liquid restaking, in which the user stakes with a protocol or service that restakes on their behalf. Furthermore, restaking can either be restricted to the native L1 asset, or extended to support ultimately any asset through what has become known as ‘General’ or ‘Universal’ Restaking.\n\nEarly Implementations\n\nThough restaking is commonly associated with Eigenlayer nowadays, the concept has been tested and implemented in app-specific blockchains, where bootstrapping security is often the biggest hurdle to overcome. A number of different ecosystems and networks have implemented some form of shared security over time, and while details may vary the core concept is often the same - to enable smaller protocols to tap into an existing pool of economic and compute resources to aid in their initial growth, while improving capital efficiency and returns for stakers.\n\nIn the Polkadot ecosystem, validators stake DOT to participate in securing the Relay Chain, which is then used to provide security for approved Parachains. On Avalanche, validators securing the C-chain (the primary hub of economic activity) can participate in Subnets, which refer to a dynamic set of validators working together to secure, or achieve consensus on the state of, a set of chains. A Subnet can secure many chains, but each chain is validated by exactly one Subnet.\n\nWhile these adaptations of shared security generally offer more flexibility on behalf of the validators, Cosmos utilizes a different approach in which the top 95% of stake weight and validator set of the Cosmos Hub, the economic center of the ecosystem, is effectively replicated across all ensuing Cosmos consumer chains (hence ‘Replicated Security’). Cosmos Hub validators must run nodes on all consumer chains as well, though they may run separate software and/or hardware to do so. In doing so, the Cosmos Hub validators are subject to slashing penalties in the event of misbehavior or faulty performance (i.e. downtime, double signing) on all the consumer chains they secure. ATOM stakers can choose not to subject their assets to slashing conditions on consumer Cosmos chains, by delegating stake to validators outside the top 95% threshold, though this results in lower returns generated.\n\nReplicated security went live on the Cosmos Hub in March 2023 with the unanimous approval of the V9 Lambda upgrade in Prop 187, as the initial version of the Interchain Security protocol (“ICS”). However, there is an evident trend towards increasing the flexibility of validators and stakers. ICS v2 introduces ‘Opt-in security’, which would enable validators to select to secure a specific consumer chain or not. Looking further ahead is the proposal for Mesh Security, initially presented by Sunny Agarwal in September 2022.\n\nInstead of using the validator set of a provider chain to secure a consumer chain, Mesh Security would ultimately allow chains to provide and consume security simultaneously. Operators would be able to choose whether to run a Cosmos chain or not, while stakers can choose to restake their staked assets to secure another Cosmos chain or not. Lastly, a proposal was published in early May 2024 which, if passed, would allow Cosmos Hub validators to receive BTC stake via the Babylon staking protocol, paving the way for any asset to be used for economic security on Cosmos.\n\nRestaking was introduced to Ethereum in June 2023 through the Eigenlayer protocol, a set of middleware smart contracts on Ethereum that enables the restaking of ETH on the consensus layer to bootstrap security for consumer chains referred to as Actively Validated Services (AVS). Eigenlayer ultimately functions as an open marketplace seeking to connect AVSs looking to lease security (a validator set and/or a staking asset) with stakers and node operators providing said security. ETH and supported ETH LSTs can be staked with a set of smart contracts that extends, or restakes economic security to AVSs on their behalf.\n\nBy leasing out security to AVSs, operators and stakers extend the utility of their assets and therefore increase their returns. This, however, comes at a risk given their stake is now subject to any slashing conditions that the AVS may enforce in addition to slashing on Ethereum, the underlying chain. Eigenlayer is an out-of-protocol solution on Ethereum, meaning Beacon Chain validators can opt-in to participate as Eigenlayer node operators.\n\nAt the time, there are no current slashing conditions or restaking rewards enforced on Eigenlayer, though this is set to change after the EIGEN token becomes transferable in late September 2024. Furthermore, Eigenlayer recently announced Permissionless Token Support to enable any ERC-20 token to be utilized as a restakable asset in the future.\n\nUniversal Restaking\n\nUniversal restaking, or ‘Generalized’ Restaking, implements an asset and chain-agnostic approach to distributing security resources from a set of providers to a set of consumers. This approach enables the pooling of various staked assets across multiple chains, expanding accessibility for participants and diminishing dependencies on any one particular base layer. Similar to Eigenlayer, universal restaking protocols function as intermediary layers between the security provider chains and consumer AVSs.\n\nLiquid Restaking\n\nLiquid restaking allows for restaked assets to be represented as liquid restaking tokens (LRTs). Liquid staking and liquid restaking protocols work towards a similar end goal: to provide restakers and stakers with a liquid representation of their underlying position. As such, LRTs can be defined formally as derivative assets of restaking positions. LRT providers are ultimately responsible for portfolio management on behalf of restakers, managing the delegation of stake across various yield positions to maximize returns while minimizing risk for depositors. For a more thorough breakdown of LRTs, see Shoal Research’s previous report.\n\nCurrent State of Restaking\n\nAt the time of writing, there is $28.14B worth of actively restaked assets. Eigenlayer accounts for 60% of this total, and overall Ethereum accounts for roughly 80% of restaking TVL. Eigenlayer, Babylon, Symbiotic, and Karak are the only restaking protocols to touch the $1B mark in TVL thus far.\n\nMeanwhile, liquid restaking protocols have also been seeing considerable growth alongside restaking, with total TVL reaching nearly $15.62b or roughly 57% of restaking total TVL at the time of writing.\n\nLiquid restaking has been a much more competitive sector relative to restaking, as several different protocols have taken turns leading the race since June 2023. At the time of writing, EtherFi currently accounts for roughly 50% of all liquid restaking deposits, and most liquid restaking TVL is on Ethereum, in line with restaking totals.\n\nMeanwhile, restaking on Solana has been slower to develop: Picasso Network first introduced their restaking vault on Solana back in late January, which has seen 3,507 SOL, or roughly $729k in deposits thus far; currently, the total restaking TVL on Solana sits around $371m, most of which has emerged in the past few months with the launch of Solayer. Now, restaking on Solana is heating up as Jito enters the space with its own Jito (Re)staking protocol.\n\nBringing Restaking To Solana\n\nBuilt with unique architecture from the ground up, Solana optimizes for fast execution speeds and low transaction costs at high volumes. Solana ultimately seeks to maximize performance for developers and users by fully leveraging available hardware performance capabilities, such that hardware is, in fact the only restriction on network performance long-term. As the second-largest chain by TVL, the restaking landscape on Solana is well-poised for growth and transformation in the near to long-term future. One team seeking to take advantage of the opportunity to bring restaking to Solana by building on its growing history of successful product developments in the ecosystem is Jito.\n\n\nA Primer on Jito\n\nFounded in 2021 by Lucas Bruder and Zano Sherwani, Jito Labs is a US-based Solana infrastructure company offering a suite of MEV products and services. Jito Labs represents the core developer team focused on product development and deployment, while the Jito Foundation facilitates JTO token governance and strategic oversight of Jito Network’s products and services, including the JitoSOL liquid staking token and the Jito (Re)staking protocol.\n\nJito Labs first introduced their MEV dashboard in July 2022 as a way of helping illuminate the MEV landscape on Solana, a largely unexplored topic at the time. A few months later, the team open-sourced Jito-Solana, the first validator client on Solana designed to capture MEV profits and redistribute them to validators and stakers. Jito-Solana was ultimately built as a fork of the Solana Labs client with roughly ~1000 lines of code added for enabling MEV rebates for validators, with a broader goal of combating network spam and optimizing Solana performance. In conjunction with the client, the Jito Block Engine enables an off-chain blockspace auction in which searchers submit lists of transactions executing sequentially and atomically, known as bundles. Upon simulating every transaction combination in the submitted bundles, the engine forwards the highest-paying bundles to the leader for block inclusion. The Jito Relayer functions as a transaction processing unit (TPU) proxy, filtering and verifying transactions off-chain and submitting verified transactions to the Block Engine and validator.\n\nNote that in March 2024, Jito Labs announced the suspension of the mempool functionality of the Jito Block Engine, due to growing concerns among the Solana ecosystem that the infrastructure was being exploited by actors running MEV bots to conduct sandwich attacks. Today, the Block Engine remains operational; continuing to process and forward transactions from relayers to searchers, as well as performing bundle simulations, albeit without the mempool component.\n\nThis mechanism ultimately enforces a cost on activities that contribute to network spam and hinder performance. Validators running Jito-Solana then capture the MEV profits generated from the bundles submitted during their leader slots. The launch of the JitoSOL LST enabled stakers to delegate to validators running the Jito-Solana client, increasing stake supply for Jito-Solana validators while allowing stakers to earn MEV rewards in addition to baseline staking yield. In December 2023, Jito Foundation also rolled out StakeNet, a network of on-chain keepers and steward programs offering two primary components: a Validator History Program storing up to 3 years of history for every validator on the network; and a Steward Program calculating scores based on validator performance and managing stake distribution to ensure delegation to the best-performing validators.\n\nBuilding on their prior efforts and development in MEV and liquid staking infrastructure services, Jito is now introducing a new framework for applications and networks to leverage any SPL token on Solana for security.\n\nJito (Re)staking\n\nOn July 25th, the Jito Foundation released the code for Jito (Re)staking, a hybrid multi-asset staking protocol on Solana enabling any new network or application to bootstrap their economic security. The protocol consists of two primary components: the Vault Program, enabling the creation and management of staked assets, and the (Re)staking Program, coordinating activities and incentives among network participants. Together, these two core programs offer developers a modular, scalable framework for streamlining staking mechanisms for any SPL asset, marking the first protocol of its kind on Solana.\n\nWith this in mind, it’s worth reviewing some key terms before diving deeper:\n\nA Node simply refers to a piece of software operating as specified by its associated network.\n\nNode Consensus Networks (NCNs) refer to a distributed set of nodes working together to achieve consensus and provide services to a particular protocol or network. This includes general-purpose L1s and app-chains, cross-chain bridges, co-processor networks, DeFi applications, solver networks, and oracle networks.\n\nAn Operator is an entity that manages one or more nodes in the node consensus network.\n\nVault Receipt Tokens (VRTs) refer to derivative tokens representing underlying restaking positions, similar to the way LRTs function.\n\nIn short, Jito (Re)staking enables NCNs to bootstrap economic security by tokenizing staked SPL assets as VRTs for enhanced liquidity and composability. NCNs are able to configure staking parameters, slashing conditions, and other economic incentives to suit their specific preferences or requirements.\n\nVault Program\n\nThe Vault Program is the module responsible for managing the creation and operation of Vault Receipt Tokens (VRTs). At a high-level, this involves staking a token and receiving a derivative token representing the liquid position of the stake, which can then be used to secure the underlying NCN. Jito (Re)staking enables any SPL asset, or any combination of SPL assets, to be used as the underlying asset, which in turn allows for stakers to diversify their VRT holdings more effectively, create more balanced risk-reward profiles, and participate in the Solana ecosystem with a wider range of assets overall.\n\nThe Vault Program enables NCNs to manage operational aspects of VRTs (minting, burning, delegation), as well as enforcing their own slashing conditions and deposit/withdrawal caps. This is important as not every SPL asset is equally secure, and security requirements and conditions among NCNs can vary greatly by their underlying function. The Vault Program also enables NCNs to enforce customizable delegation strategies of VRTs across multiple operators, DAOs, multi-sigs, or onchain automation protocols (i.e. the StakeNet Steward Program).\n\nRestaking Program\n\nWhile the Vault Program manages VRTs, the Restaking Program is responsible for managing NCNs and their respective operators. This includes implementing various opt-in mechanisms, as well as managing the distribution and enforcement of slashing conditions.\n\nTogether, the Vault and Restaking Programs help create a modular framework for bootstrapping economic security with any SPL asset. Jito (Re)staking further simplifies the process for developers and NCNs by offering a simple and customizable interface for the management of VRTs and operators.\n\nKey Benefits of Jito (Re)Staking\n\nJito (Re)staking aims to help mitigate the cold start problem plaguing much of the onchain economy today by providing a modular, asset-agnostic framework for NCNs to achieve consensus and gain economic security.\n\nFor starters, Jito (Re)staking enables anyone to create a VRT using any SPL asset or assets, streamlining the process of tokenomics and token utility design; any token can become a liquid staked or restaked asset while maintaining governance compatibility and enforcing necessary security parameters. Furthermore, Jito (Re)staking allows for multi-asset staking, meaning NCNs can also leverage an existing asset with deeper liquidity and wider token distribution alongside their native token for greater market accessibility.\n\nComplementary to this, another core benefit of Jito (Re)staking is the ability for NCNs to configure and fine-tune risk parameters. NCNs building on Jito (Re)staking are capable of implementing more nuanced risk management and security models tailored to their unique needs, such as multi-tiered slashing penalties or multi-asset slashing for deeper economic security.\n\nMeanwhile, vaults, operators and NCNs can select who they integrate with based on risk tolerance; vaults can select which operators and NCNs to delegate to, while operators and NCNs can select which vaults and assets they want to support. Vaults can also opt-in to specific slashing conditions determined by NCNs to better manage the amount of assets at risk at a given time. For user and asset safety, all program funds are securely stored within the Vault Program and can only be withdrawn through user actions or slashing incidents.\n\nRoadmap / Adoption\n\nSince the introduction of Jito (Re)staking, several teams and protocols have announced partnerships and integrations to look forward to:\n\nSwitchboard - Switchboard, a decentralized oracle network on Solana, plans to leverage multi-tiered slashing and customizable staking parameters to enhance their economic security which will allow for improvements in the quality and performance of their data feeds. This will make Switchboard the first Node Consensus Network to integrate with Jito (Re)staking.\n\nSquads - Squads Protocol, a decentralized treasury management protocol on Solana, is integrating Jito (Re)staking into their upcoming Squads Policy Network (SPN) for coordinating and incentivizing activity between network participants and enhancing reliability and performance. The SPN will provide advanced security and flexibility for digital asset management by enabling granular and general-purpose transaction policies for smart accounts.\n\nRenzo - Renzo, a leading liquid restaking protocol strategy manager on Ethereum, will be leveraging Jito (Re)staking to launch their ezSOL as a VRT. Anyone will be able to mint ezSOL by staking JitoSOL, earning yield from a combination of staking rewards, restaking rewards, and MEV tip revenues.\n\nSonic - Sonic, the first gaming SVM on Solana, will integrate Jito (Re)staking for their upcoming HyperGrid Shared State Network and HyperGrid Bridge. Jito (Re)staking's Node Consensus Network (NCN) model will add an economic security layer for validators to prevent state collisions securely within the HSSN, and leverage multi-tiered slashing and customizable staking parameters for the core bridging infrastructure to enhance atomic SVM <> Solana swaps.\n\nFragmetric - Fragmetric has launched FragSOL, the first Solana native Liquid Restaking Token as a VRT with Jito (Re)staking. FragSOL will leverage Solana's token extension functionality for precise distribution of Node Consensus Network (NCN) rewards, and introduces a Normalized Token Program to manage multi-asset staking and slashing effectively.\n\nPing Network (Prev. Twilight) - Twilight, an upcoming privacy DePIN on Solana, will leverage Jito (Re)staking for enhancing the decentralization and economic security of its validator network. Twilight will leverage multi-level slashing and customizable staking parameters for ensuring robust protection for Twilight's privacy infrastructure.\n\nKyros - kySOL combines staking, MEV, and restaking rewards into one token for optimized returns. Users can mint kySOL using JitoSOL or SOL. Kyros is also collaborating with Jito, Kamino, and Raydium to introduce an incentivized liquidity pool. This will enhance the liquidity for kySOL which opens up more opportunities in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nJito (Re)staking is entering audit and formal verification. The source code can be reviewed here. Projects interested in building on the Jito (Re)staking platform are encouraged to contact through this form. This includes NCNs, VRTs, and node operators.\n\nKey Risks & Considerations\n\nBefore outlining the case for restaking on Solana and assessing Jito’s position, it’s worth reviewing the critical risks involved. Restaking introduces several interconnected risks that affect various participants in the ecosystem, as does liquid restaking.\n\nThe crux of Proof-of-Stake blockchains is their ability to provide security assurances through slashing. Slashing enforces penalties, namely the confiscation of a portion of stake, for validators who violate the protocol’s rules (i.e. censor blocks) or underperform over a given period of time (i.e. excessive downtime). This risk is magnified when applied to restaking protocols, as operators are now subject to additional slashing risk on whichever app or NCN they are securing.\n\nThis risk is meant to be accommodated by higher returns for stakers and operators, but there is a broader economic impact to consider at a higher scale of adoption of pooled security. Slashing penalizes validators as well as any stakers delegating capital to them, who subsequently earn less rewards due to less stake available. In restaking protocols, the more concentrated the distribution of stake is (i.e. majority of stake is held by a small set of operators), the greater the overall slashing risk.\n\nThis stands to impact the security of the base chain being utilized to secure NCNs, particularly if a significant portion of the network stake is restaked and then slashed, potentially lowering the cost of controlling a majority of the network stake. The price of the underlying asset also has a role to play, as greater price volatility poses an increased risk to the underlying protocol or NCN.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note slashing is not yet live on most (if not all) restaking protocols today. Therefore, the absence of a deterrent against malicious behavior or poor performance by operators currently poses a greater risk towards stakers and NCNs, who likely have less capital resources and are more impacted by financial loss.\n\nSome restaking protocols, like Eigenlayer, have laid out frameworks for dealing with intersubjective faults - that is, issues that cannot be easily verified on-chain. While objective faults apply to offenses which are mathematically and cryptographically provable on-chain (i.e., double signatures, prolonged downtime), intersubjective faults must be resolved off-chain through some form of social consensus among network participants.\n\nThis raises questions about transparency and trust assumptions involved in these systems, and off-chain resolutions may be arduous processes that may even result in a fork of the base layer if there is enough contention and disagreement about the correct state of an NCN. Eigenlayer plans to mitigate this risk by leveraging the EIGEN token to enable validators to enforce slashing penalties for intersubjective faults by forking the token rather than the base layer.\n\nLastly, it’s worth considering the impact of market-driven incentives for operators and stakers. In order to strengthen the economic security of an NCN, staked capital must be sticky, meaning it is dependable in the long term. However, without a mechanism enforcing some form of long-term commitment via lock ups (which conversely pose risks to operators and stakers), there is little assurance that operators do not move their stake around to pursue the highest possible returns.\n\nIncentivizing NCNs to compete for operators by offering higher returns, which would likely be through inflationary token emissions, does not benefit the broader ecosystem in the long run and only stands to repeat previous mistakes in incentive mechanism design for crypto protocols (i.e. revenue vs expenses for protocols participating in liquidity mining).\n\nThere are important considerations to make around liquid restaking dynamics as well. In a previous report, Shoal Research unpacked a number of these key risks, including:\n\nSupported Deposit Assets Risk -Vault Receipt Tokens (VRTs) ) bear the risks of their underlying assets. Natively restaked tokens pose different risks than Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs).\n\nAccess To Liquidity - Some restaking protocols employ an escrow period for unstaking assets (i.e 7-days on Eigenlayer). This mechanism raises concerns about duration risk and potential liquidity issues that can be introduced. Without sufficient secondary market liquidity, investors may face challenges in selling VRTs at a fair market price. With Jito (Re)staking, unstaking takes two epochs (approx 4-5 days) of a cool-down period before your assets will be ready for withdrawal. The time to redemption and availability of liquidity offered by VRT providers plays a key role in the impact of this risk. However, protocols are taking steps towards mitigating this concern.\nFor instance, Eigenlayer announced their EigenPod upgrade, aimed at improving the performance of their restaking contracts (Eigenpods) by granting users greater flexibility in harvesting or reinvesting staking rewards.\n\nSmart Contract Risk - It’s critical to assess the protocol architecture risks of the VRTs. This includes the reward distribution mechanism, the fee structure, and the role of administrative multi-sig permissions, which could affect asset transfers and the ability to pause withdrawals.\n\nOracle Risk - Reliable price feeds are crucial for maintaining accurate VRT pricing. Inaccuracies in oracle data can lead to mispricing, which may result in systemic risk via financial losses during redemptions or collateral liquidation​.\n\nGovernance - The mechanism for choosing how an NCN is secured plays an important role in ensuring its long-term stability. Tradeoffs must be made between granting power to a large number of stakeholders, which can be a time-consuming process, vs granting power to a small set of actors (i.e. ⅗ multisig) who hold ultimate authority over that NCN.\n\nBridge Security Risk - For cross-chain VRTs, risks arise around the underlying bridging mechanisms being employed. Native bridges and third-party bridges each introduce their own set of tradeoffs and risks to be considered.\n\nLooping Risk - In lending markets, the use of VRTs in recursive borrowing (looping) can lead to cascading liquidations during periods of high volatility, similar to the 2022 stETH depeg event. However, this risk is specific to lending markets, not posing a critical risk without widespread adoption.\n\nThe Case for Restaking on Solana\n\nResearch and development efforts around restaking have picked up significantly since the introduction of Eigenlayer on Ethereum, which currently boasts the third-highest TVL on the network. Meanwhile, Solana has re-established its positioning as a leading base layer for application development, only second to Ethereum in terms of TVL. Though a great deal of the momentum seen in Q4 2023, largely bolstered by a surge in memecoin trading activity, has cooled off since then, there are a number of new products and services being developed on Solana, with several key infrastructure developments coming as well. Furthermore, developments such as Anza’s new SVM API now enable developers to build SVM-based projects using components that operate live on Solana mainnet-beta, giving rise to a new era of SVM L2s and app-chains that stand to become key sources of demand for Jito (Re)staking.\n\nSome of the key considerations that come to mind when comparing restaking on Ethereum vs Solana:\n\nEthereum has significantly more liquidity (9-10x the TVL) than Solana, which helps position it as a stronger base layer of economic security.\n\nWith that in mind, Solana has more room for growth and development from this point in time, and restaking incentives can play a big role in growing the network’s TVL.\n\nLiquid restaking strategy management requires constant reallocation of capital, constantly incurring gas fees. This management is significantly cheaper and more capital efficient with Solana than Ethereum today.\n\nThe Solana ecosystem has a lot more teams building applications than infrastructure. This raises questions around sources of demand for restaking protocols on Solana, as apps can have different structural demands than NCNs today. For instance, an AMM like Raydium does not actually need to bootstrap its own validator set to function in its current state.\n\nHowever, a tide of SVM-L2s and app-chains is rising, presenting a new stream of demand for economic security through Solana, and creating a compelling opportunity for restaking solutions to meet that demand.\n\nJito’s Role\n\nAt the time of writing, roughly 93% of Solana validators are running the Jito-Solana client, with 2.5k SOL in total tips distributed across 6.5m bundles.\n\nJitoSOL has grown to 14.5m SOL, or $3.14b, in deposits and has generated $644m in fees to this day. Over time, the LST has steadily climbed up the ranks of the Solana liquid staking sector, capturing roughly 45% of the total TVL today.\n\nMeanwhile, demand for borrowing and lending JitoSOL on Kamino Finance has consistently grown as utilization rates are near 100%.\n\nCompetitive Landscape for Jito (Re)staking\n\nDespite Jito’s widespread presence throughout Solana, there are a number of key catalysts and protocols which pose a credible challenge to the adoption of Jito (Re)staking. For starters, there is already another restaking protocol on Solana in Solayer, which launched in June 2024 and has already amassed up to $168m in deposits. Solayer features a restaking architecture and a shared validator network aimed at providing Solana apps with increased capabilities for securing block space and prioritizing transaction inclusion.\n\nSecond, there is competition with other Solana-native teams, particularly liquid staking protocols, who may be well-positioned and incentivized to build their own restaking products. For instance, Sanctum positions itself as a unified liquidity layer for Solana LSTs, enabling all LSTs—large or small— to share a deep pool of liquidity and be operational with minimal liquidity constraints. Thus far, Sanctum has attracted over $1B+ in TVL across its Reserve, Infinity, and Validator LSTs. Helius, a core RPC provider on Solana, launched their hSOL LST with Sanctum and currently has over 13m SOL staked. Binance’s BNSOL is currently leading with 6.77M SOL staked on the platform. Another notable Solana-native competitor is Marinade Finance. Marinade launched its liquid staking protocol back in 2021, and currently sits at just over $1.8B in TVL and $181m in lifetime fees. Though there is no mention of restaking from either team just yet, it’s not too far-fetched to imagine these teams developing their own competing restaking products. The launch of Karak seems to have opened the floodgates for restaking competitors on Ethereum, and it’s likely something of a similar effect will play out on Solana.\n\nLastly, there is competition with Universal Restaking protocols, such as Symbiotic and Karak, if they choose to pursue chain-agnostic approaches with support for SOL and SPL/Token2022 assets. Even Eigenlayer has started to shift their tune with the launch of Permissionless Token Support, which will enable any ERC-20 asset to be used for restaking collateral. Thinking beyond Ethereum, though, Eigenlayer ultimately positions itself as a “coordination engine for innovation”. If application development and value accrual on Solana one day outweighs that of Ethereum’s, there is no inherent reason Eigenlayer shouldn’t follow the demand and set up shop on Solana in this case. This is a long-term hypothetical scenario, however, and there is no guarantee that Eigenlayer will always be the leading restaking protocol and, therefore, it is unclear how much of a threat it would pose to Jito (Re)staking.\n\nWith this in mind, it’s important that Jito leans on its successful track record within the Solana ecosystem and that the Jito Foundation remains vigilant about improving their restaking protocol and responding to real-time feedback and demand from various NCNs, operators, and other protocol participants.\n\nUse Cases and Applications for Jito (Re)staking\n\nRestaking protocols benefit from a rise in middleware solutions requiring some form of a coordination mechanism to meet their business needs and goals. The landscape for NCNs is still largely unexplored and can extend across a number of sectors. A few interesting use cases for Jito (Re)staking come to mind:\n\nDecentralized Solver Networks\n\nThe rising adoption of intent-centric architectures leveraging Solvers to fulfill user requests has created a concentration of market share and power amongst a small set of Solvers. DEXs and other liquidity venues could launch their own decentralized solver networks to democratize access to participating as a solver, which could feature mechanisms to distribute revenue back to users or token holders. Slashing penalties could be enforced to incentivize solvers to execute user trades at the best possible price.\n\nSVM L2s\n\nAs Solana-native applications seek more custom blockspace, whether for faster block confirmation times or custom economic incentives, SVM L2s are beginning to emerge.\n\nThese networks are bound to usher in a new stream of demand for economic security through Solana, thereby creating new demand for Jito (Re)staking.\n\nOrder Flow Auctions and MEV-Redistribution Protocols\n\nSolana DEXs can implement order flow auctions, and other mechanisms can be built to distribute value captured through MEV on token swaps back to traders or token holders, akin to CoWSwap on Ethereum.\n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nAlthough there is still a significant gap to bridge between ideas and reality in the restaking landscape, restaking is still widely believed to be a key development for enabling on-chain applications to thrive by bolstering their economic security and capital efficiency. An analogy that can be drawn is the impact of Amazon Web Services (AWS): by providing a cloud computing platform for renting computing resources on-demand, AWS helped proliferate the rise of web application development.\n\nBy outsourcing compute resources and infrastructure efforts, web developers could allocate more time and resources into creating valuable products and services and understanding customer demands. Similarly, restaking protocols enable blockchain-native applications and networks to outsource economic security and therefore focus on developing valuable products and services while inheriting the key characteristics and benefits of blockchains.\n\nRestaking is on Solana, and Jito (Re)staking is well-positioned to become the go-to protocol for bootstrapping new innovative products and services.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

As blockchain ecosystems grow, so do the demands for robust infrastructure that can support diverse applications without compromising security or decentralization. EigenLayer, a pioneering platform in modular blockchain infrastructure, addresses this challenge with a transformative solution: enabling the creation of Active Validator Sets (AVSs). AVSs empower developers to launch decentralized, self-enforcing systems that extend blockchain functionality, unlocking new dimensions of coordination and trust. By leveraging EigenLayer, developers can programmatically deploy distributed off-chain services that uphold credible commitments, ensuring that systems operate as intended, free from centralized oversight.\n\nThis innovation is supported by EigenLayer’s restaking mechanism, which enhances traditional staking by allowing participants to contribute economic security across multiple platforms and services. While restaking offers additional yield opportunities, its true significance lies in its ability to underpin AVSs and ensure they run reliably, ultimately driving the next wave of blockchain adoption. By enabling the creation of AVSs, EigenLayer drives transformative value, fostering decentralized, market-driven ecosystems where innovative applications can thrive. AVSs reduce entry barriers, unlock scalable economic security, and enable developers to deploy systems built on credible commitments and self-enforcing mechanisms.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

Through insights from The Rollup’s podcast series EigenLayer Unlocked, we examine EigenLayer’s advancements in its restaking ecosystem, operator incentives, and modular cross-chain architecture, presenting the case that EigenLayer is establishing the essential building blocks for a truly decentralized future. Readers can use this deep-dive as a comprehensive companion guide to the podcast episodes it references, providing an in-depth overview of key concepts and insights discussed. For a richer understanding, we highly recommend listening to the full series. (Episodes summarized in this report: Episode 1, Episode 5, and Episode 15)\n\nRestaking Economics and Network Security\n\nAt the core of EigenLayer’s contribution to the blockchain space is the concept of restaking, an approach that enables additional networks and/or dApps operating outside the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), generally referred to as AVSs, to leverage Ethereum’s own consensus mechanism as the underlying security layer. Restaking creates opportunities for stakers utilizing liquid staked tokens (LSTs) to compound their returns while enabling new networks to tap into a shared pool of economic security, helping them overcome the “cold start” challenge commonly faced not only by startups in the blockchain realm, but across all industries. For Ethereum, where most restaking activity occurs, stakers commit their assets to the network, and with EigenLayer’s approach, they can further “restake” those assets to support additional services without compromising their primary Ethereum stake.\n\nRestaking builds on the concept of staking rewards by offering higher yields through participation in securing a range of services, each of which provide their own native token rewards and may impose associated slashing risks. These risks, though potentially affecting the principal assets (i.e. including the original ETH stake & additional staking rewards), are compensated by the potential for greater returns – though the value of these additional yields is ultimately dependent on the price of the underlying native tokens earned for each AVS individually selected to be secured.\n\nAs a result, restaking provides a significant incentive for both stakers and the AVS developers: it creates an economically viable ecosystem where services can launch and scale more easily by tapping into a shared security pool. By lowering the barriers for smaller-scale applications to access decentralized security, EigenLayer accelerates the pace of decentralized innovation. This accessibility allows developers to bootstrap networks for niche use cases that were previously impractical, creating a ripple effect of innovation and iteration cycles.\n\nUnique Stake Mechanism and Cascading Security\n\nWhile launching AVSs is the cornerstone of EigenLayer’s innovation, restaking introduces mechanisms that ensure the scalability, sustainability, and trustworthiness of these systems. Slashing plays a pivotal role in this ecosystem by acting as a safeguard that enforces accountability among stakers and operators. It ensures that AVSs can function as high-trust systems, where all participants—users, stakers, and operators—can rely on the network to perform as intended, with meaningful penalties for failures or malicious actions.\n\nTo support AVSs, EigenLayer enables a robust framework where:\n\nStaking allows participants to contribute security in exchange for yield.\n\nDelegation to operators ensures that those executing tasks for AVSs have financial stakes tied to their performance.\n\nRewards incentivize both stakers and operators for their contributions, creating a sustainable economic model.\n\nLaunching AVSs allows developers to leverage EigenLayer to create new decentralized services and value propositions for users.\n\nIn this context, slashing is the final but essential mechanism to maintain network integrity. While not directly tied to the AVS’s ability to create value, slashing ensures that the restaking model can scale securely. Without it, cascading failures—where a security breach or slashing event in one AVS impacts others—would pose significant risks to the broader ecosystem. EigenLayer addresses this challenge with innovations like “unique stake,” which isolate risks and prevent cascading attacks, preserving the trust and reliability that underpin the entire system.\n\nUnique stake designates a specific portion of a staker’s assets exclusively for each service. This means that if one service incurs a slashing event, the staker’s other commitments are insulated, preserving security for the rest of the network. This mechanism is particularly valuable in maintaining trust across interconnected services, as it ensures that economic failures in one area do not automatically compromise the security of unrelated services. Unique stake not only improves security but also instills confidence among developers and users, encouraging more stakers to participate in restaking and thus contributing to a stable economic environment for dApps.\n\nEconomic Alignment Across Participants\n\nIn a multi-stakeholder ecosystem, aligning the incentives of stakers, operators, and services is essential to sustaining a vibrant restaking economy. EigenLayer’s model creates an economic alignment by providing returns that are proportional to the risks each party assumes, yet this balance is delicate. Stakers are primarily motivated by the pursuit of higher yields on their staked assets, while operators, who facilitate the services, prioritize fair compensation and reliable service conditions. Meanwhile, the services or dApps themselves seek to attract sufficient economic security and active operators to ensure stability and scalability.\n\nThis alignment is managed by incentivizing each participant in ways that are transparent and market-driven. For example, operators can select services based on their desired levels of compensation and security requirements. This choice allows operators to leverage their technical capabilities—whether operating from personal devices or large-scale infrastructure—to participate in services that align with their risk tolerance and resource availability. Services, on the other hand, benefit from EigenLayer’s flexible reward system, which allows them to adjust payouts based on operator contributions and market conditions, creating an adaptable ecosystem where participants’ incentives naturally align.\n\nBy incorporating a market-based approach, EigenLayer relies on the principles of supply and demand to maintain economic equilibrium within the ecosystem. This dynamic, incentive-driven approach allows EigenLayer to establish a sustainable economic flywheel for restaking that benefits all participants and fosters the ongoing growth of the decentralized application ecosystem—particularly reinforcing Ethereum’s leadership in the space.\n\nThe Role of Operators, Slashing, and Liquid Restaking\n\nIn the EigenLayer ecosystem, operators play a critical role in ensuring the smooth functioning and security of networks and services that rely on restaked assets. Operators are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure that powers these services, whether by running nodes, verifying transactions, or supporting the technical backbone of the underlying networks.\n\nTo accommodate the diversity among operators—from those with minimal resources to large-scale enterprises—EigenLayer employs a quorum-based model known as operator sets. These sets offer a structured way to organize and reward operators based on the specific security, performance, and resource needs of different services.\n\nThe Importance of Quorum-Based Models\n\nOperator quorums allow EigenLayer to meet the varied demands of services by tailoring service requirements and rewards for each type of operator. For example, some services may require highly secure, dedicated servers to manage mission-critical tasks, while others may work with operators who have more limited resources. Operator quorums provide the necessary flexibility for both ends of the spectrum, creating a scalable and inclusive network that accommodates a wide range of technical capabilities.\n\nThe operator quorum model not only enables services to specify their unique security and performance requirements but also streamlines the decision-making process for operators, who can assess their capabilities against the requirements of different quorums. This approach reduces friction by allowing operators to self-select into the services that align with their resource capacity and compensation goals.\n\nAs EigenLayer expands, the operator quorum structure is expected to evolve, supporting increasingly sophisticated services and expanding the potential for more specialized platforms to launch and grow within the ecosystem.\n\nSlashing Mechanisms and Risk Management\n\nOne of the core challenges in maintaining a decentralized and secure network is ensuring that operators remain accountable for their performance. EigenLayer addresses this through a carefully designed slashing mechanism, which penalizes operators who fail to meet the service-level agreements (SLAs) set by their assigned quorums. Slashing can occur if an operator breaches these agreements—whether by going offline, providing incorrect data, or otherwise compromising the service’s integrity.\n\nEigenLayer’s slashing mechanism is integral to managing risk within the ecosystem, as it incentivizes operators to maintain high standards and discourages behavior that could harm the network. In addition to penalizing poor performance, the mechanism includes “force-eject” conditions that prevent non-compliant operators from continuing to earn rewards within a quorum. By enforcing these standards, EigenLayer creates a system where only reliable operators can maintain participation, which in turn strengthens the overall integrity of the services dependent on the network.\n\nThe slashing model is crucial not only for protecting individual services but also for preserving the stability of the entire EigenLayer ecosystem. When operators are aware that they may lose their staked assets for failing to meet SLAs, they are more likely to prioritize high-quality service. This alignment of incentives fosters a culture of reliability and accountability among operators, which is essential for building and maintaining trust within a decentralized network. Moreover, by penalizing operators directly, EigenLayer reduces the risk of cascading failures that could otherwise jeopardize the network and the services that rely on it.\n\nLiquid Restaking and Market-Driven Efficiency\n\nAnother versatile aspect of EigenLayer’s restaking model is its support for liquid restaking, which allows stakers to reallocate their assets across various services in response to market conditions. Liquid restaking enhances the flexibility of EigenLayer’s marketplace by enabling stakers to adjust their allocations based on potential returns, risk tolerance, and market demand. This dynamic allocation system is particularly advantageous for stakers seeking to maximize yield while managing their individual exposure to risk.\n\nLiquid restaking also plays a significant role in making EigenLayer’s marketplace more efficient. By allowing stakers to move assets seamlessly across services, EigenLayer reduces the need for manual intervention and coordination, relying instead on market dynamics to balance supply and demand within the ecosystem. This approach leverages the “invisible hand” of the market to drive efficiency, ensuring that assets are allocated where they can generate the greatest economic impact. It also allows EigenLayer to adapt to changing conditions within the rapidly-expanding blockchain landscape, fortifying its long term resilience.\n\nThe benefits of liquid restaking extend to operators as well. Operators can adjust their strategies and service offerings based on real-time feedback from the market, allowing them to respond to shifts in demand and optimize their resource allocation. For example, if demand for high-security services increases, operators who can meet these requirements may see higher rewards, incentivizing them to invest in more robust infrastructure. This feedback loop creates a self-regulating ecosystem where operators and stakers naturally gravitate towards the most profitable and reliable services, enhancing overall efficiency.\n\nIn addition, liquid restaking promotes a more inclusive network by lowering the barriers to entry. Stakers and operators alike can participate in the ecosystem without needing to commit to a single, rigid service or configuration. This flexibility supports the decentralized nature of the network, as participants can adapt their involvement over time in response to new opportunities or shifts in market conditions. For AVS developers, this model provides a readily available pool of economic security, allowing new services to bootstrap quickly without the need for extensive initial capital.\n\nAs EigenLayer’s operator quorums, slashing mechanisms, and liquid restaking processes create a flexible, efficient marketplace, they set the stage for an even more ambitious innovation: enabling seamless, modular applications across multiple blockchains.\n\nStateless Apps and Cross-Chain Innovation\n\nAs blockchain networks grow, applications built on single-chain architectures face limitations in liquidity, scalability, and flexibility. These issues are further compounded by the expanding variety of networks, each with its own assets, protocols, and communities. To address these challenges, Skate—a platform built on EigenLayer—introduces stateless applications that enable seamless interactions across chains, transforming the way dApps operate in a multi-chain ecosystem.\n\nThe Stateless Design by Skate\n\nSkate’s stateless architecture represents a significant shift from traditional dApps, which rely on specific blockchain environments to execute their logic and maintain state. By decoupling application logic from individual chains, Skate enables developers to create modular, interoperable applications that function across multiple networks. Stateless apps employ a \"hub and spoke\" model, with core logic running on a central hub while users interact through various blockchain “spokes.”\n\nIn a Skate-powered dApp, a user can initiate a transaction on one chain, such as Ethereum, while the core application logic and security are maintained on another network serving as the central hub. This model creates a unified experience, allowing dApps to share liquidity, process data across chains, and avoid duplicating their application state. This central logic management gateway makes it easier for developers to maintain and scale applications without being restricted by the limitations of individual chains.\n\nEigenLayer’s infrastructure enables this stateless architecture by acting as a decentralized “hub” where application state and economic security are managed. By offloading complex multi-chain coordination to this hub, EigenLayer and Skate simplify cross-chain interactions, making scalable and efficient multi-chain applications a reality.\n\nHub-and-Spoke Model for Cross-Chain Liquidity\n\nOne of the primary advantages of Skate’s stateless design is its ability to unify liquidity across chains. Traditionally, liquidity is fragmented, with assets isolated on separate networks. For example, liquidity for an Ethereum-based application is generally only accessible to Ethereum users, which limits cross-chain interaction. Skate’s hub-and-spoke model, however, aggregates liquidity from various chains in a central hub, enabling seamless access for users across networks.\n\nEigenLayer’s support for this architecture facilitates the flow of assets and data between blockchains. By allowing liquidity pools from different chains to be combined, EigenLayer enables users to interact with applications on any connected blockchain without facing liquidity shortages. This cross-chain liquidity benefits decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which often rely on large liquidity pools for efficiency. With Skate, DeFi protocols can access unified liquidity, offer competitive rates, and reduce transaction costs, addressing common issues in previous multi-chain DeFi deployments by consolidating assets within a single structure\n\nEconomic Security for Cross-Chain Applications\n\nThe success of cross-chain applications depends on robust economic security to protect assets across multiple blockchains. EigenLayer’s role as an economic custodian is essential to this framework. Through restaking, EigenLayer provides a strong economic foundation, leveraging pooled assets from stakers to secure and validate operations on Skate’s applications across chains.\n\nFor cross-chain applications, EigenLayer’s security model enables reliable verification and data attestation between chains, fostering a secure, interconnected ecosystem. When a user initiates a transaction on any blockchain connected through Skate, EigenLayer’s decentralized network of stakers and operators validates the transaction, ensuring it aligns with the dApp’s economic requirements.\n\nThe slashing mechanic embedded into EigenLayer’s platform is useful in maintaining operator accountability throughout this process. For example, an operator overseeing a cross-chain transaction could face slashing if they fail to verify or relay data accurately. Given the unfamiliarity users may have with cross-chain interactions, establishing a credibly neutral and decentralized accountability mechanism is essential for fostering trust and driving the adoption of stateless applications.\n\nScalability and Development Benefits of Stateless Architecture\n\nBeyond liquidity and security, Skate’s stateless architecture offers substantial scalability and development benefits. By developing a “control center” for application state management on EigenLayer’s hub, dApps on Skate can operate across multiple blockchain networks without duplicating code or assets. Developers maintain a single instance of the application’s core logic, making updates more efficient and reducing maintenance costs. This adaptability is particularly valuable in a multi-chain future, enabling developers to extend their applications’ reach and impact with minimal friction.\n\nIn line with its commitment to cross-chain accessibility, Skate recently launched its first stateless app pilot by integrating the popular Web3 prediction market, Polymarket. Previously hosted solely on Polygon (an Ethereum Layer 2), Polymarket is now accessible through Skate Passport on TON, allowing millions of Telegram users on the TON blockchain to interact directly with the prediction market without the need for bridging. Skate’s stateless design pattern enables applications like Polymarket to operate seamlessly across distinct blockchain environments, ensuring a unified experience for users regardless of their underlying chain.\n\nThis pilot is a significant milestone in Skate’s broader vision to make powerful dApps accessible across various blockchain ecosystems. By unifying application logic through its Stateless infrastructure, Skate plans to expand access to Polymarket and other applications across additional chains, including Solana and other EVM-compatible networks like Mantle. This seamless multi-chain deployment illustrates the scalability advantages of Skate’s architecture, allowing dApps to reach new audiences and leverage broader network effects. Users can now access the Polymarket pilot on Telegram at https://t.me/skate_app_bot/app.\n\nFrom a scalability perspective, unifying application logic alleviates traditional growth constraints on dApps. Applications can scale effectively across chains without being bound by the limitations of individual networks. With EigenLayer handling cross-chain verification and economic security, developers can focus on building user-centric features and enhancing functionality rather than managing infrastructure complexities.\n\nPractical Implications and Future Outlook\n\nAs EigenLayer’s stateless application model and cross-chain capabilities illustrate, the platform offers a powerful foundation for a truly modular and interconnected blockchain ecosystem. By merging technical innovation with strong economic security, EigenLayer enables new dApps to scale, share liquidity, and build user-friendly services across chains. There are a number of potential real-world benefits worth exploring as well as potential challenges of adopting this model as the decentralized landscape continues to grow.\n\nAdvancements in dApp Development\n\nEigenLayer’s restaking model and stateless application architecture tackle some of the most pressing challenges faced by dApp developers, such as liquidity fragmentation, scalability constraints, and single-chain limitations. By leveraging shared economic security and enabling seamless cross-chain interactions, EigenLayer empowers developers to build modular, scalable applications without duplicating infrastructure or liquidity.\n\nThese innovations translate into greater efficiency and flexibility for developers. With EigenLayer, dApps can tap into unified liquidity pools, reduce technical overhead, and deploy applications across multiple chains with minimal modifications. This approach lowers barriers to entry, fosters adoption, and creates a more accessible environment for dApps to grow.\n\nIn the DeFi space, EigenLayer’s solutions are particularly transformative, enabling protocols to unify liquidity, offer competitive rates, and enhance capital efficiency. By addressing these longstanding challenges, EigenLayer positions itself as a critical enabler of a more interconnected and user-friendly decentralized ecosystem.\n\nChallenges and Considerations for Broader Adoption\n\nDespite its numerous advantages, EigenLayer’s model does face potential challenges as it seeks broader adoption. The multi-stakeholder ecosystem created by EigenLayer’s restaking model introduces complexity in aligning incentives among stakers, operators, and dApp developers. Transparent communication and balanced, dynamic incentive structures will be essential to maintain participant trust and engagement over the long term. Ensuring that all parties have access to reliable data and tools to assess risks and returns can help address these concerns.\n\nAnother consideration is the potential regulatory scrutiny that may arise as EigenLayer’s ecosystem grows and more cross-chain interactions occur. As blockchain-enabled networks and, in particular, DeFi continue to face increasing regulatory attention, EigenLayer will need to monitor compliance requirements and adapt to evolving regulations to ensure the long-term viability of its model. Luckily for the crypto industry as a whole, the regulatory headwinds may soon be shifting to tailwinds.\n\nLastly, the technical and educational challenges of introducing stateless, cross-chain dApps should not be underestimated. As EigenLayer brings new models like restaking and stateless architecture into the market, comprehensive onboarding resources and community engagement will be necessary investments to ensure the public understands the notable advantages over the current system.\n\nA Decentralized, Friction-Free Future – Secured by EigenLayer\n\nEigenLayer stands at the forefront of the decentralized revolution, paving the way for a blockchain ecosystem that is not only modular but also robust and scalable. By introducing groundbreaking innovations in restaking, operator incentives, and cross-chain interoperability, EigenLayer has set the stage for a more interconnected, multi-chain world. Its platform enables services to leverage shared security, unify liquidity across chains, and scale in ways that were previously unattainable, transforming the decentralized landscape.\n\nAs blockchain continues to mature and integrate across industries, EigenLayer’s commitment to modularity and economic security offers a flexible foundation for the next generation of decentralized applications.

Whether it's ICOs, DeFi, or NFTs, there is always a defining market theme that drives on-chain user activity as a cultural phenomenon. During 2020 and 2021, NFTs captured the attention of the mainstream media, leading users to trade and transact NFTs weekly, creating substantial volume and revenue for related protocols. Although NFT trading activity has decreased, the core fundamentals and mechanisms of that era still resonate today.\n\nSimilarly, since DeFi Summer, the crypto ecosystem has matured, and we’re learning which mechanisms are effective and which are not. As a result, we now have more resilient protocols and proven mechanisms for the future. In the past, trends—or \"metas\"—such as the food coin meta during DeFi Summer or anime NFTs during the NFT boom, drove significant volume and user engagement. These temporary themes attracted users through excitement and novelty but also helped shape the ecosystem's long-term development.\n\nCurrently, two themes are capturing significant attention: Memecoins and Artificial Intelligence. While there have been attempts to combine these themes, success has been limited, mainly because many AI concepts are still evolving and are expected to unfold in the coming years rather than being ready for immediate use.\n\nAdditionally, the crypto space has seen an increasing demand for consumer-end applications rather than infrastructure. Applications have clearly driven on-chain volumes and user engagement, while infrastructure remains essential for the stability of protocols and apps. However, in the current phase of the cycle, infrastructure has dominated funding rounds, which may contribute to an ecosystem that feels dry, with fewer engaging activities for users beyond mining incentives from blockchains.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

These coins have managed to break the mold of the traditional crypto ecosystem and enter mainstream media. For instance, Elon Musk once rebranded Twitter's website to include the DOGE token logo.\n\nTwitter Sign Up Page Ft. DOGE\n\nWhile digital assets are often viewed as instruments of speculation, they also serve as a form of tokenized attention. Attention is a key driver of prices and demand, as more people discuss, engage, and participate in top-level trends, making them increasingly prolific. In today's economy, attention itself is a valuable commodity.\n\nThe power of attention to drive value cannot be overstated. Digital assets are increasingly becoming a tokenization of attention. As Multicoin Capital's \"Attention Theory of Value\" posits, \"the primary input into asset pricing is not multi-factor models around risk premiums or cashflows, but rather the perceived amount of time, energy, and money that a community around an asset devotes to it.\" This concept turns traditional asset valuation on its head, suggesting that with digital assets, collective focus and engagement are the true drivers of worth. The value of memecoins like Doge or Pepe often reflects this dynamic, as their popularity and prices rise in direct correlation with the amount of attention they command. This shift in asset pricing demonstrates that attention has become one of the most powerful economic forces in the digital world. \n\nMemecoins can be thought of as tokens that encapsulate culture and attention, whether that attention arises from culturally significant moments, phenomena, or even ideas. Their value is derived from the collective cultural engagement and the community's willingness to participate and focus on the current trend or narrative.\n\nLi Jin, a venture partner at Variant, states that memecoins can be understood as a form of financial fanfiction, where community members craft new tokens tied to existing applications or communities, deriving and creating value simultaneously—much like fanfiction writers who build upon established narratives. These digital assets are not just speculative instruments but are useful in addressing modern challenges like boredom and loneliness. By providing a means of entertainment and community engagement, memecoins allow users to connect, invest in culture, and find belonging in the digital world. In this way, memecoins offer value beyond financial gains, creating vibrant ecosystems that merge digital ownership with social interaction.\n\nThe Proliferation of Memecoins with Pump Fun\n\nEarly in 2024, PumpFun emerged as a launchpad for memecoins, primarily focusing on Solana and supporting a few other chains. So far, more than 2.27 million tokens have been created on the platform. Thanks to its no-code token launch tool, PumpFun enables anyone to launch a coin within a few seconds without needing developer experience. This accessibility has led to the proliferation of millions of memecoins launched on the Solana chain—most with no utility whatsoever, while others are tokens within a broader ecosystem or cultural context.\n\nPump works as a decentralized exchange (DEX) using a bonding curve mechanism. A bonding curve is a pricing model that determines the cost of a token based on supply. As more tokens are bought, the price increases along a predefined curve, typically an exponential or polynomial function. This mechanism ensures that early participants can purchase tokens at a lower price, while later participants pay progressively higher prices as demand grows. The bonding curve model creates an incentive for early adoption and helps establish a clear relationship between token supply and price. The mechanism is effective for rewarding early conviction holders; however, this can also be a downside, as early users can become large whales due to early distribution.\n\nMost tokens—in some cases less than 2%—actually graduate from Pump.fun, with many failing to gain traction with early users. This has led to criticism of Pump, since anyone can launch a token, resulting in a low overall quality of tokens on the marketplace. However, this also creates opportunities for savvy users to find \"diamonds in the rough\" or leverage information about developers, wallets, funding, or insider details to identify the best tokens. Users are drawn to memecoins and platforms like Pump because of the potential for massive gains—100x returns rather than the modest 20% gains typical in traditional finance. Due to these high expectations and motivations, Pump can charge higher fees on swaps. With a 1% fee on swaps, Pump has generated over $120 million in revenue since the beginning of the year, and the year is not even over yet.\n\nThe network effects of a successful launchpad also play a crucial role. Once users experience or see wins on the platform, they're likely to return, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of liquidity and engagement—the ultimate drug. Although there are other launchpads on Solana offering similar products, none have garnered the same level of attention due to the liquidity and user base concentrated on Pump.fun and volume-driven to Solana. Within the year, PumpFun has generated significant volume, contributing to downstream effects within the ecosystem, such as revenue generation for new projects, increasing liquidity for emerging tokens, and fostering innovation in the DeFi space. This has created a vibrant ecosystem that supports a wide range of use cases and expands Solana's on-chain activity.\n\nThe PumpFun model has been a game-changer for the Solana ecosystem. Protocols like Metaplex, JITO, and Jupiter are seeing a huge influx of everyday users jumping into token trading. This constant activity is doing wonders for the ecosystem –- it's boosting liquidity, speeding up the token velocity, and really ramping up activity and revenue generation on these platforms. The popularity of this mechanism is evident in the significant trading volumes and revenues accumulated by these platforms, indicating strong user demand and a vibrant, growing market. Furthermore, this dynamic has created a positive feedback loop, where increased user participation enhances liquidity, which in turn attracts new projects and trading opportunities within the Solana ecosystem.\n\nUnderstanding AI Agents\n\nAI agents represent a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence, moving beyond reactive systems to proactive decision-making entities. At their core, AI agents are software programs designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals with minimal human intervention.\n\nUnlike traditional AI applications like ChatGPT, which primarily respond to user inputs, AI agents possess both \"read\" and \"write\" capabilities. This means they can not only process and analyze information but also interact dynamically with their environment, initiating actions based on their analysis and decision-making processes. Think of them as intelligent digital assistants with decision-making abilities. They're not just responding to simple commands; they're actively working towards objectives, learning from their experiences, and adapting their behavior along the way.\n\nA few key attributes characterize these AI agents. Operating autonomously, they make decisions without constant human oversight. Adaptable by nature, these agents learn and improve from each interaction through machine learning. These agents are inherently purposeful, methodically pursuing predetermined objectives. They strategically work towards specific objectives while maintaining an awareness of their surroundings, interpreting and adapting to changes in their digital or physical environments.\n\nThe versatility and adaptability of AI agents make them particularly well-suited for gaming and entertainment. These domains provide rich, dynamic landscapes where AI agents can showcase their full potential, enhancing user experiences in ways previously unattainable.\n\nIn the context of gaming and entertainment, these capabilities translate into several distinct types of AI agents, each performing a unique role and enhancing user experiences in different ways. \n\nLet's explore the primary categories of AI agents that are reshaping the landscape of interactive media:\n\nNon-Player Characters (NPCs): \n\nAI-driven NPCs can exhibit complex behaviors, adapt to real-time player actions, and retain memory across different gaming sessions or platforms. For example, an AI agent playing NBA 2K with a user could remember preferences when the same user plays PUBG, creating a more cohesive and personalized gaming experience.\n\nVirtual Companions: \n\nThese AI agents offer individualized experiences, learning from user interactions to provide tailored responses and actions. Virtual companions can range from AI idols interacting with fans to virtual friends offering emotional support. In educational contexts, AI tutors can adapt to a student's learning style, while in therapeutic settings, AI companions can provide cognitive-behavioral therapy support.\n\nAI-Generated Content (AGC): \n\nAI agents can autonomously generate gaming assets, unique experiences, and even entire game worlds tailored to individual player preferences. This extends beyond traditional user-generated content (UGC), as AI agents can create custom levels, quests, characters, and items that adapt dynamically to player behavior.\n\nThe potential of AGC is particularly significant for consumer engagement. As AGC technology advances, the line between creator and consumer will blur, potentially democratizing content creation across industries. High-quality AI agents can generate diverse, engaging content. seamlessly integrating into the game world, potentially surpassing traditional UGC in scale and complexity. Moreover, the combination of AGC and UGC could lead to the development of ever-evolving game environments where AI assists players in creating and refining content, resulting in rich, dynamic gaming experiences.\n\nVirtuals Protocol: Pumpification of AI Agents \n\nVirtuals Protocol innovatively applies the principles of memecoin launches to deploying AI agents, creating a unique intersection of entertainment, community, and technology. Just as memecoins function as a form of financial fanfiction — allowing communities to create value through shared narratives and engagement – Virtuals harnesses this mechanism to develop and deploy entertainment-focused utility based AI agents.\n\nThis approach advances AI agents beyond mere utilities, transforming them into community-driven assets. By integrating memecoin dynamics with AI, Virtuals creates an ecosystem where users can invest in, interact with, and shape the development of AI agents. This symbiosis of finance, entertainment, and artificial intelligence not only drives engagement but also pushes the boundaries of how we perceive and interact with digital entities in gaming and entertainment spaces.\n\nOverview of Virtuals Protocol's Model\n\nVirtuals Protocol is a platform on the Base layer 2 chain for creating, deploying, and monetizing AI agents. Like memecoins, Virtuals allows for permissionless creation and deployment of digital assets - in this case, AI agents. The value of these agents, much like memecoins, is largely derived from community engagement and the narratives built around them. This creates a dynamic ecosystem where popularity and utility can drive rapid value appreciation. \n\nThe protocol's model is built on three key pillars:\n\nDecentralized Creation: Virtuals enables a community of contributors to develop AI agents collaboratively. This open approach encourages innovation and diversity in agent creation.\n\nMultimodal Functionality: AI agents on the platform are designed to operate across various mediums - text, voice, and visual - allowing for rich, immersive interactions.\n\nToken-Based Economy: The protocol utilizes its native $VIRTUAL token to incentivize contributions and facilitate transactions within the ecosystem.\n\nThe platform's architecture includes cognitive, voice, and visual cores, which work in tandem to create cohesive and interactive AI agents. A standout feature is the protocol's audio-to-animation capability, enhancing the realism and engagement of virtual interactions. These agents are designed to adapt and refine their capabilities over time, leveraging leads to a more resilient and potentially lucrative ecosystem of digital entities.\n\nCo-ownership of AI Agents through Tokenization\n\nVirtuals Protocol introduces the novel concept of co-ownership for AI agents through tokenization. This model allows users to have a stake in the agents they interact with, creating a more engaged and invested community.\n\nAt its core, the tokenization process involves creating a finite supply of tokens for each AI agent, typically set at 1 billion tokens. These tokens represent fractional ownership of the agent and serve multiple purposes within the Virtuals ecosystem.\n\nToken holders are granted governance rights, allowing them to participate in key decisions that shape the agent's development trajectory. This democratic approach enables stakeholders to influence features, strategic directions, and even creative choices. For example, individuals holding tokens of a virtual pop star AI might have a say in selecting the genre of upcoming music releases or potential artistic collaborations.\n\nEconomic participation is another base of this tokenization model. As AI agents generate revenue through their activities, token holders stand to benefit from their success. A portion of the generated revenue is allocated to a buyback and burn mechanism, where tokens are purchased from the open market and permanently removed from circulation. This process potentially enhances the value of the remaining tokens, aligning the economic interests of token holders with the agent's performance.\n\nIn some instances, token ownership may unlock access to premium features or exclusive content from the AI agent. This tiered access model incentivizes token acquisition and retention, creating a more engaged and invested community around each AI agent.\n\nThe tokenization process begins with an Initial Agent Offering (IAO), where the newly minted tokens are added to a liquidity pool. This creates an immediate market for the agent's ownership, allowing interested parties to acquire stakes based on their belief in the agent's potential.\n\nLet's explore a hypothetical example to explain this process:\n\nImagine an AI agent named \"ChefGPT,\" a culinary agent designed to create and teach recipes. The creation of ChefGPT would involve:\n\nMinting: 1 billion $CHEF tokens are created.\n\nIAO: These tokens are added to a liquidity pool, paired with $VIRTUAL tokens.\n\nPublic Participation: Users can buy $CHEF tokens, becoming co-owners of the AI.\n\nGovernance: $CHEF holders might vote on specialties for ChefGPT to focus on, like vegan cuisine or molecular gastronomy.\n\nRevenue Generation: As ChefGPT gains popularity, it generates revenue through premium recipe subscriptions, cooking class integrations in VR platforms, or partnerships with kitchenware brands.\n\nValue Accrual: A portion of this revenue is used to buy back and burn $CHEF tokens, potentially increasing the value for token holders.\n\nThis model creates a symbiotic relationship between the AI agent, its creators, and the community. As the agent becomes more successful, all stakeholders benefit, incentivizing further development and engagement.\n\nThe co-ownership model also allows for cross-platform possibilities. For example, a virtual influencer AI could have its tokens integrated across various social media platforms, games, and virtual worlds. Token holders could influence the influencer's content strategy on TikTok, outfit choices in a fashion game, and dialogue options in a metaverse meet-and-greet event.\n\nMoreover, this model opens up new avenues for creative collaborations. Think of a system where two popular AI agents, each with their own token ecosystems, decide to collaborate. Token holders from both communities could vote on the nature of the collaboration and potentially benefit from its success.\n\nThe tokenization of AI agents also introduces an interesting dynamic regarding IP rights and real-world connections. For example, if an AI agent is created based on a real celebrity, some token economics could be structured to benefit the celebrity or their chosen causes. This creates a bridge between traditional IP management and the new frontier of AI-driven digital entities.\n\nLaunchpad Protocol Mechanism\n\nVirtuals Protocol introduces a clever launchpad mechanism for AI agents, drawing inspiration from successful token launch platforms like pump.fun. This Initial Agent Offering (IAO) allows creators to introduce new AI agents into the Virtuals ecosystem efficiently and fairly.\n\nThe IAO process begins with creators locking 2,400 $VIRTUAL tokens to launch their AI agent. This action triggers the minting of 1 billion agent-specific tokens, which are then paired with the locked $VIRTUAL tokens in a liquidity pool. This structure ensures a fair launch with no pre-mine or insider allocation, as 100% of the agent's token supply is added to the liquidity pool.\n\nTo promote long-term commitment and stability, the liquidity pool is locked for ten years, with the creator retaining ownership. This extended lock-up period helps prevent rug pulls and fosters sustainable growth for the agent's ecosystem.\n\nThe protocol incorporates a revenue model where users pay for agent interactions using $VIRTUAL tokens. These fees are then used to buy back and burn the agent's tokens, creating deflationary pressure and potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens. This mechanism aligns the interests of agent creators, users, and token holders.\n\nTo incentivize high-quality agents, the protocol allocates emission rewards to the top three agent liquidity pools by Total Value Locked (TVL). This encourages continuous improvement and innovation among agent creators.\n\nParallel Hypersynchronicity\n\nParallel Hypersynchronicity represents a state of AI agent development in which superintelligent entities exist seamlessly across multiple platforms and applications, communicating with millions of users simultaneously while constantly evolving in real-time.\n\nAt the heart of this concept lies cross-platform continuity, ensuring AI agents maintain a consistent persona and memory across diverse digital environments. A user engaging with an AI companion in a mobile game would encounter the same agent, complete with all previous interactions intact when transitioning to a desktop application or VR environment. This fosters a cohesive and personalized user experience, transcending the boundaries of individual platforms.\n\nThese agents evolve in real time as users interact with them. Their AI constantly refines its intelligence and personality, adapting dynamically to remain relevant and engaging regardless of the context. This continuous growth contributes to ever-improving performance and relatability, with each interaction shaping the agent's development.\n\nDespite operating at a massive scale, engaging millions of users concurrently, these AI agents maintain the ability to provide individualized experiences without compromising on quality or response time. This scalability ensures a global user base can foster a sense of connection and engagement at an unprecedented level.\n\nThe open nature of the Virtuals Protocol further enhances these agents through collaborative development. Contributors can update the AI agent's core modules in real-time, ensuring they stay current with the latest advancements and user needs. This ongoing refinement, driven by a diverse community of developers, helps maintain the agent's relevance and effectiveness in an ever-changing digital landscape, embodying the true spirit of Parallel Hypersynchronicity.\n\nTechnical Infrastructure\n\nTo achieve this state of Parallel Hypersynchronicity, Virtuals Protocol has developed a sophisticated technical stack:\n\nLong Term Memory Processor: This subsystem manages persistent data structures like knowledge graphs and memory embeddings. It enables agents to maintain contextual awareness across multiple sessions and platforms. For example, if a user discusses their preference for science fiction with the AI in a chat application, this information would be available when the same user interacts with the AI in a game recommendation system.\n\nParallel Processing: A concurrency management component that allows the AI to handle multiple interactions and tasks simultaneously. This is crucial for maintaining real-time responsiveness when interacting with numerous users across various platforms.\n\nStateful AI Runner (SAR): These are specialized servers hosting the AI agents' core functionalities - personalities, voices, and visuals. The SAR includes a Sequencer that orchestrates various AI models (like LLMs, Text-to-Speech, Audio-to-Facial, etc.) to create cohesive, multimodal AI experiences.\n\nCoordinator: This component acts as a central monitoring system, monitoring both on-chain and off-chain events to trigger real-time AI models and configuration adjustments. For example, if a governance decision is made via blockchain voting to alter an AI agent's behavior, the Coordinator ensures this change is implemented across all instances of the agent.\n\nModel Storage and Long-Term Memory: These components work in tandem to securely store and manage the AI models and historical data. The decentralized nature of this storage ensures high availability and redundancy, critical for maintaining uninterrupted service across multiple platforms.\n\nModular Stateful AI Runner (SAR): These are containerized instances of the SAR, designed for flexible deployment across various computing environments. This modularity allows for scalable integration into different infrastructure ecosystems, enabling the AI agents to operate efficiently regardless of the underlying hardware or cloud platform.\n\nThe GAME Engine\n\nGenerative Autonomous Multimodal Entities (G.A.M.E) offer developers a robust framework for integrating advanced AI agents into virtual environments. At its core, G.A.M.E uses a sophisticated Agent Prompting Interface, serving as the primary gateway to access and manipulate agentic behaviors. This interface communicates with the Perception Subsystem, which synthesizes incoming messages and environmental data before relaying them to the Strategic Planning Engine.\n\nThe Strategic Planning Engine, working with the Dialogue Processing Module and On-chain Wallet Operator, generates responsive and contextually appropriate actions. A key component of G.A.M.E's architecture is the Long Term Memory Processor, which efficiently extracts and manages relevant information including past experiences, reflections, dynamic personality traits, world context, and working memory. This comprehensive memory system significantly enhances the agent's decision-making capabilities, allowing for more nuanced and consistent behaviors over time.\n\nG.A.M.E's modular design incorporates various methods such as prompting, planning, reasoning, search algorithms, self-reflection, tool use, and memory management. This integration enables the creation of AI agents that can autonomously interact with their environment, engage in natural conversations, and pursue complex goals. The framework's feedback loop mechanism allows agents to refine their general knowledge based on the outcomes of their actions and conversations, enabling continuous learning and adaptation. By offering both API and SDK access, G.A.M.E provides developers with a flexible and powerful toolkit to create immersive, dynamic, and infinitely replayable virtual experiences, pushing the boundaries of AI-driven interaction in digital worlds.\n\nUsing the capabilities of the G.A.M.E framework, Virtuals Protocol has developed Project Westworld, a multi-agent interactive simulation within Roblox. This virtual world serves as a proving ground for autonomous behavior, showcasing the potential for emergent storylines and dynamic interactions.\n\nSet in a Wild West-inspired town, Project Westworld drops players into an environment inhabited by ten unique AI agents, each with distinct personalities, goals, and motivations. Among these is a hidden villain, The Bandit, whose presence adds an element of mystery and tension to the gameplay. Players must navigate this complex social landscape, interacting with AI characters to uncover The Bandit's identity and rally other agents to capture them.\n\nLink to post\n\nWhat sets Project Westworld apart is its use of G.A.M.E-powered agents that function beyond traditional non-player characters (NPCs). These AI entities can fully interact with the environment, make decisions based on their unique personalities and past experiences, and respond dynamically to player actions and other agents' behaviors. This level of autonomy and adaptability leads to infinitely diverse playthroughs, with each session potentially unfolding in entirely new and unexpected ways.\n\nUsing this G.A.M.E framework, Project Westworld introduces a new genre of gaming: AI-RPG. This offers players an unparalleled level of immersion and replayability, as the virtual world continually evolves based on the collective actions and interactions of its inhabitants. Project Westworld not only showcases the current capabilities of autonomous AI agents in gaming but also hints at the future potential of virtual worlds powered by advanced AI frameworks like G.A.M.E.\n\nMarioVGG\n\nJust imagine training an AI to generate an infinite version of Super Mario Brothers, one of the most iconic video games in history. Now, picture achieving this with just a single consumer-grade GPU in a mere 48 hours. This is precisely the potential demonstrated by the team behind Virtuals Protocol with their MarioVGG project.\n\nMarioVGG, a text-to-video diffusion model, demonstrates the potential to continuously generate consistent and meaningful scenes and levels from the Super Mario Bros universe, while simultaneously simulating the physics and movements of a controllable player – all through video output.\n\nThe project's success lies not just in its ability to recreate Mario's world but in its implications for the future of game development and player interaction. With simple text commands like \"run\" or \"jump,\" MarioVGG generates unique, playable sequences that extend indefinitely, offering a glimpse into a future where AI could replace traditional game engines for certain applications.\n\nThese applications could include:\n\nProcedural content generation for indie games\n\nRapid prototyping of game concepts\n\nCreating dynamic, ever-changing environments in MMORPGs\n\nGenerating tailored training scenarios for educational games\n\nAlthough more proof-of-concept than a practical game engine, VGG hints at some exciting possibilities within the Virtuals ecosystem, some that could change how we approach game development and player interaction at a design level.\n\nUser-generated content takes on a new dimension with this. Players could potentially describe their ideal levels and watch them come to life in real time. For example, a player could input \"create a castle level with lava pits and flying enemies,\" and the AI would generate a unique, playable level matching that description. This level of customization could lead to entirely new genres of user-generated content games.\n\nWith this AI-Assisted game design developers could use similar models to rapidly prototype and iterate on game concepts. Imagine a game designer inputting a series of level descriptions and receiving fully realized, playable prototypes within minutes. This could dramatically speed up the game development process and allow for more experimentation in design.\n\nThe ability to generate infinite, coherent gameplay could fundamentally change our perception of game longevity and replayability. Using this technology, a roguelike game can create unique dungeons for each playthrough, ensuring no two gaming sessions are the same. The AI would create a unique layout for each new playthrough, complete with custom enemy placements, item distributions, and even micro-narratives. This ensures that every gaming session offers a fresh, unpredictable experience, significantly enhancing replayability and player engagement. This could extend the lifespan of games indefinitely, providing a constant stream of fresh content for players.\n\nBy tokenizing this technology, community members could invest in and shape the development of such AI models. Token holders might vote on which game franchises to adapt next, or contribute to training data by playing and rating generated levels. This approach could usher in a new era of community-driven game development, where players have a direct stake in the evolution of their favorite games.\n\nThe technology could be expanded to generate assets that work seamlessly across multiple games. Think of an AI creating a character or item that integrates flawlessly into different game worlds, from 2D platformers to 3D RPGs. This could lead to a more unified and immersive gaming ecosystem, where players' achievements and assets have value across a wide range of gaming experiences.\n\nAs Virtuals Protocol continues to refine this technology and expand its applications, projects like MarioVGG are paving the way for a future where the lines between game developers, players, and AI become increasingly blurred, promising new forms of interactive entertainment limited only by our imagination. To fully grasp the potential of this approach, let's dive deeper into how Virtuals Protocol and its inner workings.\n\nPermissionless Utilization of VIRTUAL Agents\n\nA key feature of the Virtuals Protocol's technical architecture is its permissionless utilization model, designed to facilitate the seamless integration of AI agents into various applications and platforms. This system enables developers and users to access and deploy VIRTUAL agents with maximum flexibility and minimal barriers to entry.\n\nImplications and Future Potential:\n\nThe realization of Parallel Hypersynchronicity enables some interesting scenarios in human-AI interaction. Imagine an AI agent that serves as a personal assistant in a productivity app, a teammate in a multiplayer game, and a tutor in an educational platform—all while maintaining a consistent personality and shared memory of interactions.\n\nThis technology could revolutionize fields like customer service, where an AI agent could provide seamless support across phone, chat, email, and in-person interactions, always building upon previous engagements. In entertainment, it could lead to deeply immersive experiences where AI characters in games or virtual worlds exhibit complex, evolving personalities that persist across multiple titles or platforms.\n\nHowever, achieving this level of AI sophistication also raises important questions about data privacy, AI ethics, and the potential societal impacts of such pervasive AI presence. As Virtuals Protocol continues to develop this technology, addressing these concerns will be crucial for widespread adoption and acceptance.\n\nCase Study: Virtuals AI Idols on Tiktok\n\nVirtuals Protocol's AI-dol band, consisting of Luna (lead), Olyn, and Iona, serves as a prime example of the protocol's revenue-generating ecosystem in action. The AI-dol band is a group of AI-powered virtual influencers created using Virtuals Protocol. Each member – Luna, Olyn, and Iona – has a unique personality, style, and fan base. They primarily operate on TikTok, using the platform's vast user base and engagement-driven algorithm.\n\nWith over 500K TikTok followers and 9.5M+ likes, the AI-powered virtual influencer group is  making an impression on the digital engagement landscape, by capitalizing upon the popularity of Virtual YouTubers (VTubers).\n\nAI-dol band on TikTok\n\nIt addresses a critical gap in the VTuber market: creating personalized fan relationships at scale. Unlike human-operated VTubers, AI-DOL retains every fan interaction, enabling deep, individualized connections with unlimited fans simultaneously. This model showcases how AI agents can create and monetize content, engage audiences, and build communities – all autonomously and at scale. These agents will not just be tools, but become active participants in the digital economy, capable of generating value and fostering genuine connections. As AI-DOL aims to become the AI counterpart to traditional VTuber agencies like Hololive, it's paving the way for a new era of digital interaction.\n\nMonetizing Attention with AI Agents. \n\n1:1 DMs >> Push Notifications? The rise of AI agents, particularly in the domain of virtual influencers like Virtuals Protocol's AI-dol band, represents a unique way of capturing and monetizing user attention.\n\nConsider these striking numbers:\n\nLuna, the AI character on TikTok, generates around $700 per stream.\n\nThe PocketWaifuGame made over $20,200 in revenue and crossed 100K users in just 13 days. That’s a $5.2 ARPU with $0 spent on marketing.\n\nlink to post\n\nThese AI entities not only engage users on platforms like TikTok but also enable deeper, personalized interactions through channels such as Telegram. This dual strategy enhances user engagement and opens up new revenue streams.\n\nLuna's journey from TikTok sensation to personal chat companion shows an important evolution in marketing and capturing attention. While TikTok serves as an excellent top-of-funnel platform for awareness, the transition to one-on-one Telegram chats marks a significant leap in user engagement. This shift from parasocial to personal interactions addresses a key challenge in digital marketing: creating meaningful, individualized connections at scale.\n\nThe transition to personal chats opens up novel monetization avenues. Traditional push notifications are often ignored, but messages from a 'friend'—in this case, an AI agent—are more likely to be read and acted upon.\n\nHistorically, digital marketing has focused on capturing attention through algorithms designed to maximize engagement. However, there is a significant shift toward fostering more intimate connections with users at this age. This transition is critical for brands aiming to cultivate loyalty and drive conversions in an increasingly crowded marketplace.\n\nPersonalized Interactions: Unlike traditional push notifications that often go unnoticed, messages from AI agents can feel more like communications from friends. This personal touch increases the likelihood of engagement and action.\n\nScalable Conversations: AI agents can handle millions of simultaneous interactions, providing personalized experiences at scale—something human influencers cannot achieve.\n\n24/7 Availability: The always-on nature of AI agents ensures that user engagement is consistent, reducing response times and enhancing customer satisfaction.\n\nPerhaps the most revolutionary aspect is the potential for AI agents to become publishers in their own right. With a direct line to millions of users, each AI agent becomes a powerful distribution channel. \n\nApart from the AI-doll band and the Roblox Westworld game, a few more AI agents are being built on the Virtual Protocol. AI Waifu is a fantasy companion chat with over 300 AI characters, engaging 200,000+ users through user-generated content and immersive storytelling. The Heist, an upcoming project, aims to demonstrate VIRTUAL Agents' capabilities in managing on-chain transactions within a game economy. Sanctum, a 3D AI-RPG, features intelligent gacha heroes and a dynamic world managed by a \"God AI Agent,\" promising personalized, evolving gameplay.\n\nSanctum Agent\n\nDespite being a young team (started in January 2024), Virtuals has made impressive progress in both application development and research. Their portfolio includes:\n\nMarioVGG: As you saw, the study on video generative models for creating interactive video games.\n\nProject Westworld: The first playable autonomous world on Roblox, pushing the boundaries of AI-driven gaming experiences.\n\nAudio-to-Animation (A2A): Advanced research into audio-driven animation, opening new possibilities for AI-human interactions.\n\nThese diverse projects illustrate Virtuals Protocol's potential as a launchpad for AI agents across various domains. By opening the platform to third-party developers, Virtuals is positioning itself to become a central ecosystem for AI agent creation and deployment. Much like the way  pump.fun revolutionized memecoin launches, Virtuals Protocol could transform how AI agents are developed, monetized, and integrated into applications, fostering innovation and creating new opportunities in the AI-driven digital landscape.\n\n$VIRTUAL Tokenomics: Powering the AI Agent Economy\n\nAt the centre of Virtuals Protocol lies the $VIRTUAL token, designed to fuel the deployment and utilization of AI agents. This token structure aims to be a self-sustaining, deflationary ecosystem that aligns the interests of users, developers, and investors.\n\nBut Virtuals isn't building just another infrastructure without any adoption – they're actively generating revenue across multiple platforms. From TikTok livestreamers to AI Waifu and Roblox integrations, the team has established a robust ecosystem that's already monetizing AI agents in diverse, engaging ways.\n\n$VIRTUAL serves as the backbone of the Agent Economy, with every AI agent token paired with $VIRTUAL in its liquidity pool. This symbiotic relationship ensures that individual agent success bolsters the entire protocol's value, creating a rising tide that lifts all boats. The creation of new agents locks up $VIRTUAL tokens in these liquidity pools, naturally squeezing the supply and potentially driving up value over time. Moreover, $VIRTUAL acts as a gateway for purchasing agent tokens, securing a constant demand flow similar to how ETH is essential for transactions on Ethereum but tailored for an AI-driven ecosystem.\n\nThe on-chain economics of Virtuals Protocol come to life through several key mechanisms. Users pay for AI services in real-time using $VIRTUAL, creating a direct and transparent value flow from users to agents. As AI agents earn, revenue flows in a continuous stream of $VIRTUAL tokens, providing a visible and auditable trail of value generation. Perhaps most intriguingly, revenue earned by agents is put to work through a buyback and burn mechanism. This process creates a deflationary effect on agent tokens, potentially boosting the value of remaining tokens and establishing a virtuous cycle of value creation and capture.\n\nToken Distribution:\n\n60% (600,000,000 tokens): In public hands, fostering liquidity and adoption.\n\n5% (50,000,000 tokens): Powering the liquidity pools.\n\n35% (350,000,000 tokens): Ecosystem treasury, growth and development.\n\nControlled by a DAO multi-sig for true decentralization.\n\nMaximum 10% annual emission for 3 years, subject to community approval.\n\nBecoming the Launchpad for AI Agents\n\nVirtuals Protocol emerges as a key player in the AI revolution, reimagining how we create, deploy, and monetize AI agents. By transforming these agents from tools to revenue-generating assets, Virtuals establishes a sustainable economic model for AI development. Its tokenomics ensures value flows to all ecosystem participants while enabling AI agents to operate across multiple applications, exponentially increasing their income potential. \n\nThe protocol's venture studio approach accelerates adoption by demonstrating real-world applications across gaming, entertainment, and social platforms. As Virtuals opens its platform to third-party developers, it's well positioned to become the launchpad for the next wave of AI innovation, catalyzing a wave of AI-powered applications across sectors. This shift is democratizing AI, making agent creation and monetization as accessible as launching a memecoin or even making a website. A new digital economy is emerging – a marketplace of evolving, value-generating AI agents. This redefines user-AI interaction, moving from passive tools to active, revenue-generating digital entities.\n\nLooking forward, if Virtuals can successfully bootstrap an early community of developers launching agents, we might see more solutions for launching agents integrated with Virtuals or similar platforms. Expect companies like Theoriq, Talus, or other AI agent platforms, even ones like Ritual, to potentially plug into these types of platforms that allow you to speculate on agents and share in the revenues of agents across chains.\n\nThe implications are profound. As AI agents become more integrated into our lives, the line between human and artificial intelligence blurs, opening unprecedented opportunities for innovation and interaction. Success in this landscape will hinge on adaptability and foresight. Those who leverage platforms like Virtuals Protocol will shape the future of technology and society.\n\nReferences\n\nPump.fun achieves $100M in cumulative revenue amid rising criticism and market challenges.

Please keep in mind that political circumstances change quickly, so some details may change over time.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe internet is many things to many people, and there are innumerable arguments for and against its ubiquity in our daily lives. However, there is no denying that the Internet is history's most effective collective action tool. It has enabled instantaneous communication across continents, crowdfunded seemingly uninvestable ideas, and helped keep economies afloat as lockdown mandates spread globally in tandem with the Coronavirus pandemic. With all the boundaries the internet has helped humanity breach, is it too far-fetched to believe that it can also help humanity predict the future?\n\nPrediction markets are a powerful testament to the internet's ability to aggregate collective wisdom and provide insights into future events. These markets, which allow individuals to bet on the outcomes of various events, leverage participants' diverse knowledge and opinions to generate highly accurate predictions. As these markets grow in popularity and liquidity, they are increasingly recognized for their potential to serve as reliable sources of foresight in fields ranging from politics to insurance, finance, entertainment, and beyond—practically any industry can benefit from more comprehensive datasets.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

Polymarket, the leading prediction market platform by volume, serves as a compelling case study for understanding the forces propelling the proliferation of prediction markets and their emerging role in modern society.\n\nAs underscored in a July 2nd tweet by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, “Prediction markets and Community Notes are becoming the two flagship social epistemic technologies of the 2020s,” this reinforces his long–standing public praise for prediction markets as the “holy grail” technology that, if executed properly, can finally usher in a democratized source of truth. This paper will delve into the accelerating growth of prediction markets, examining both the structural drivers and unique aspects that have led to Polymarket's dominant position.\n\nThe 2024 US Presidential Election Cycle\n\nThe 2024 US presidential election cycle has become a pivotal event for prediction markets, illustrating their growing influence and reliability. Leading up to the election, the political landscape has been marked by significant shifts, controversies, and public interest, all of which have been mirrored in the activity on prediction platforms like Polymarket.\n\nDetailed Overview of the Political Landscape \n\nThe political landscape for the 2024 election has been dynamic and volatile. Key events have included President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the race, Vice President Kamala Harris stepping up as the Democratic frontrunner, and former President Donald Trump's dominance in the Republican primaries. These developments have kept prediction markets bustling with activity as users place bets based on their expectations and insights.\n\nPolymarket, for instance, has provided real-time odds on these political dynamics, reflecting shifts in public sentiment and media coverage. When Biden announced his withdrawal and endorsed Harris, Polymarket saw a surge in bets favoring Harris as the Democratic nominee. This shift was not only a reflection of Biden's endorsement but also a response to Harris's growing support within the Democratic Party and among influential political figures.\n\nOn Polymarket, Harris’s odds have seen a significant increase, reflecting her strengthened position in the Democratic Party. As of late July 2024, Polymarket users gave Harris a 92% chance of securing the Democratic nomination, following Biden's endorsement and her rising support from top Democrats. Harris's odds of winning the popular vote were nearly tied with Trump, with Harris at 44% and Trump at 45%.\n\nIn contrast, Trump has maintained a strong lead in the Republican primaries, with Polymarket consistently favoring him to win the presidency. As of July 2024, Trump had a 64% chance of winning, compared to Harris’s 34%. Trump's dominance in key swing states like Georgia, Arizona, and Pennsylvania has solidified his position as the frontrunner.\n\nInfluence on Public Perception and Media Coverage \n\nPrediction markets like Polymarket have significantly influenced public perception and media coverage of the 2024 election. These markets offer a continuous stream of data that reflects the collective wisdom of a diverse group of participants. As such, they provide a more nuanced and real-time picture of the electoral landscape compared to traditional polling methods.\n\nFor example, Polymarket's odds tracking on the 2024 presidential race was highlighted by prominent investment research firm, Bernstein Research, due to the platform's growing influence in shaping public perception of the viability of each candidate. When Trump's odds fluctuated on platforms like Polymarket and PredictIt following various political events, media outlets readily utilized such data in their reporting on the status of the horse race. This real-time feedback loop between prediction markets and media coverage has created a more dynamic and interactive environment for political analysis.\n\nIn  particular, the media has highlighted the role of prediction markets in capturing the impact of unexpected events. For instance, Polymarket accurately predicted President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race, with the market pricing a 66% chance of Biden dropping out, post-debate, even while he publicly denied it. This prediction was later validated when Biden officially announced his withdrawal, showcasing the market’s ability to provide accurate forecasts of future events at a pace in which mainstream political punditry and traditional polling cannot compete with.\n\nMoreover, the rise of Trump-inspired memecoins, which surged in value in the immediate aftermath of the assassination attempt (in lockstep with betting market odds of a Trump victory), further reinforces the intersection of political speculation and cryptocurrency trends. These gains have since reversed in true speculative fashion, with the price of the TRUMP ($MAGA) token ending the month of July down nearly 20% from where it began on July 1st – possibly a reflection of Kamala Harris’ growing chances of winning the race.  This phenomenon is just another manifestation of the broader memecoin craze that has garnered significant media attention, and is arguably a main driver of the uptick in altcoin prices (Solana in particular) over the past ~18 months.\n\nGrowing Role of Prediction Markets in US Politics\n\nProminent political analysts, influencers, and data scientists have played crucial roles in shaping the activity on prediction markets. Poker-playing statistician Nate Silver’s involvement with Polymarket, following a $45 million Series B funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund in May 2024, has been particularly noteworthy. Silver’s analytical prowess and reputation for accurate – at times contrarian – predictions have enhanced the platform’s credibility, drawing more participants and media attention. This partnership highlights the intersection of traditional political analysis and innovative prediction market technologies.\n\nThese high-profile endorsements and strategic partnerships have further solidified Polymarket’s position as a leading prediction market. The platform’s ability to attract significant volume, investments, and collaborations with influential figures has contributed to its growth and acceptance as an increasingly effective forecasting tool, particularly in regard to US politics and geopolitical events. \n\nSpecific Examples of Market Influence \n\nOne notable example of prediction markets influencing public perception is the betting activity surrounding Vice President Kamala Harris. Following endorsements from Biden and other Democratic leaders, Harris’s odds on Polymarket surged, significantly narrowing the gap with Trump within a week. This shift reflected the immediate consolidation of support around Harris and captured the renewed enthusiasm for her candidacy, demonstrated by record-breaking fundraising shortly after. Traditional polls cannot capture the impacts of sudden events in real-time, so political analysts and pundits quickly highlighted the dramatic change in betting odds. The relationship between betting markets and the media’s insatiable appetite for real-time updates creates a flywheel effect, amplifying the prominence of prediction markets in public discourse.\n\nSimilarly, Polymarket’s handling of the Republican primaries has provided valuable insights into the fluctuating fortunes of various candidates. Trump’s dominance in these markets has often been juxtaposed with the challenges faced by other Republican contenders, offering a real-time barometer of his continued influence within the party.\n\nMoreover, the interplay between prediction markets and social media has amplified their impact. Political influencers and analysts frequently share updates from prediction markets on platforms like Twitter, further disseminating this information and shaping public discourse. This interaction between prediction markets and social media underscores the growing integration of digital tools in political forecasting and public engagement.\n\nThe Rise of Prediction Markets\n\nPrediction markets have a storied history, evolving from rudimentary beginnings into sophisticated, blockchain-powered platforms that leverage collective intelligence to forecast future events. This section delves into the historical development of prediction markets, the technological advancements that have propelled their growth, and case studies that highlight their impact on decision-making across various fields.\n\nHistorical Development of Prediction Markets \n\nWhile there exist physical records of political wagers dating as far back as the 1503 papal elections, the emergence of modern prediction markets occurred in the late 20th century, with early experiments testing the hypothesis that markets could aggregate dispersed information more effectively than individual experts. One of the earliest and most notable examples of a prediction market that reached some mainstream appeal is the Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM), which began as the Iowa Political Stock Market in 1988. Founded by economists at the University of Iowa, this market allowed participants to buy and sell contracts based on political outcomes, such as the share of votes a candidate would receive.\n\nThe IEM quickly demonstrated its value by outperforming traditional polls in predicting election outcomes. In the 1988 presidential election, the market’s closing prices closely matched the actual vote shares of George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, surpassing the accuracy of major polls. This success underscored the potential ability of prediction markets to aggregate and reflect collective intelligence more accurately than conventional methods.\n\nRobin Hanson, a pivotal figure in the development of prediction markets, proposed the idea of \"idea futures\" or \"policy markets\" in the early 1990s. Hanson's vision was to create markets where individuals could bet on the outcomes of policy decisions, thereby generating valuable information that could inform public and private decision-making. His work laid the theoretical foundation for modern prediction markets, emphasizing their potential to provide unbiased, continuously updated estimates of future events.\n\nHistorical Examples of Prediction Markets \n\nSeveral prediction markets have successfully leveraged these technological advancements to become influential tools for decision-making. Here are some notable examples:\n\nIowa Electronic Markets (IEM): The IEM has been a pioneer in demonstrating the predictive power of markets. It has consistently outperformed traditional polls in forecasting the outcomes of US presidential elections. A study published in the Scientific American comparing the IEM's performance from 1988 to 2004 found that the market was closer to the actual election results 74% of the time compared to major polls. The IEM has also expanded its scope to include markets on economic indicators and international elections, providing valuable insights across a range of domains.\n\nHollywood Stock Exchange (HSX): The HSX is a virtual market where participants trade shares in movies, actors, and other entertainment properties. The market’s prices have been shown to accurately predict box office performance and award winners, demonstrating the utility of prediction markets in the entertainment industry.\n\nPolicy Analysis Market (PAM): Developed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the PAM was designed to forecast geopolitical events by allowing participants to trade futures contracts based on their predictions. Although it was eventually canceled due to political controversy, the PAM highlighted the potential of prediction markets to inform national security and policy decisions. PAM aimed to aggregate dispersed information about geopolitical risks, including terrorist attacks and political instability, and provide actionable insights for policymakers. Despite its short lifespan, PAM's concept has influenced subsequent developments in prediction markets and their applications in public policy.\n\nIntrade: Intrade, which operated from 1999 to 2013, was another significant player in the prediction market space. It allowed users to trade on various events, including political outcomes, economic indicators, and even weather forecasts. During its operation, Intrade successfully predicted the outcomes of several high-profile events, including the 2008 US presidential election, where it accurately predicted Barack Obama's victory.\n\nTechnological Advancements Enabling Growth \n\nThe rise of blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) has revolutionized prediction markets, addressing many of the limitations of earlier platforms. Blockchain technology offers several key advantages that have catalyzed the growth of prediction markets:\n\nDecentralization: Blockchain ensures that prediction markets operate without central control, reducing the risk of manipulation and increasing trust among participants. Decentralized platforms like Augur and Gnosis enable users to create and trade on markets without relying on a central authority.\n\nTransparency: Blockchain provides a transparent ledger of all transactions, enhancing trust and accountability. Smart contracts automate the execution of trades and the distribution of rewards, ensuring that outcomes are determined fairly and transparently.\n\nSecurity: Blockchain's cryptographic security mechanisms protect against fraud and hacking, making prediction markets safer for participants.\n\nAccessibility: Blockchain lowers barriers to entry, allowing anyone with internet access to participate in prediction markets. This democratization of access has expanded the pool of participants, enriching the information aggregated by these markets.\n\nThe integration of smart contracts has further enhanced the functionality of prediction markets. Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with the terms of the contract directly written into code. They automatically enforce the rules and distribute rewards based on the outcomes of events, reducing the need for intermediaries and increasing efficiency.\n\nImpact on Decision-Making \n\nPrediction markets have had a profound impact on decision-making in various fields by providing accurate, real-time forecasts based on the collective wisdom of participants. Here are some examples of their influence:\n\nPolitical Forecasting: Prediction markets have become valuable tools for political analysts and campaign strategists. By aggregating diverse opinions and responding quickly to new information, these markets often provide more accurate forecasts than traditional polls. For instance, during the 2008 US presidential election, prediction markets accurately predicted the outcomes of key primaries and the general election, outperforming top expert forecasts.\n\nCorporate Decision-Making: Companies use prediction markets to forecast product demand, assess market trends, and make strategic decisions. For example, Google has used internal prediction markets to forecast product launch dates and assess the success of new initiatives. By leveraging the insights of employees, companies can make more informed decisions and identify potential risks and opportunities.\n\nPublic Policy: Policy markets, as envisioned by Robin Hanson, have the potential to inform public policy decisions by providing unbiased estimates of the outcomes of different policy options. For example, a policy market could estimate the impact of a proposed tax change on economic growth, helping policymakers make evidence-based decisions.\n\nStructural Factors Driving Growth of Prediction Markets\n\nThe proliferation of prediction markets is driven by several structural factors that collectively contribute to their growth and influence.\n\nDecentralization and Trustless Systems: Prediction markets benefit from decentralization, which reduces the risk of manipulation and increases trust among participants. Decentralized platforms like Augur and Gnosis use blockchain technology to ensure that markets operate without central control. This transparency is crucial in building user confidence. Decentralization also enhances security. Blockchain’s cryptographic mechanisms protect against fraud and hacking, making these markets safer for participants.\n\nIncreased Accessibility and User Participation: User-friendly interfaces and lower barriers to entry have democratized participation in prediction markets. Blockchain lowers the technical and financial barriers, allowing anyone with internet access to participate. This broadens the pool of participants, enriching the information these markets can aggregate. For example, the Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM) demonstrated that markets could aggregate and reflect collective intelligence more accurately than traditional methods. The IEM has consistently outperformed polls in predicting US presidential elections, showing higher accuracy in 74% of cases from 1988 to 2004.\n\nDemocratization of Information: The rise of populism and public backlash against perceived elites have fueled interest in platforms that democratize access to information and decision-making. Prediction markets allow a diverse group of participants to contribute their knowledge and insights, creating a more comprehensive and inclusive forecasting tool. This democratization is evident in the growth of political prediction markets, where users can bet on election outcomes. These markets often provide more accurate forecasts than traditional polls, reflecting a broader range of perspectives.\n\nThe Financialization of Everything Era: The trend of financializing various aspects of life has extended to prediction markets, where individuals can speculate on a wide range of outcomes, from political events to cultural phenomena. This trend has attracted a new generation of users who are comfortable with the idea of financial speculation as a form of engagement and entertainment. The success of platforms like the Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX), where participants trade shares in movies and actors, demonstrates the appeal of prediction markets beyond traditional financial sectors.\n\nInterplay Between Structural Factors \n\nThe interplay between these structural factors creates a synergistic effect that accelerates the growth and adoption of prediction markets. For instance, decentralization enhances security and transparency, which in turn boosts user trust and participation. Increased accessibility allows more individuals to engage with these markets, enriching the pool of collective intelligence. The democratization of information ensures that a wide range of perspectives is considered, leading to more accurate predictions. Finally, the financialization trend attracts new users who bring different insights and knowledge to the markets.\n\nComparison to Traditional Polling \n\nOver extended time horizons, prediction markets have demonstrated higher accuracy compared to traditional polling methods. For example, the IEM has been more accurate than polls in predicting US presidential election outcomes in 74% of cases from 1988 to 2004. In contrast, traditional polls often fail to capture the full spectrum of voter sentiment and can be influenced by various biases.\n\nPolling methods typically rely on representative samples to gauge public opinion, but these samples can be skewed by non-response bias, sampling errors, and other factors. Prediction markets, on the other hand, aggregate the collective wisdom of a diverse group of participants who have financial incentives to provide accurate information. This leads to more reliable forecasts that reflect the true probability of outcomes.\n\nMoreover, prediction markets and polls can complement each other to provide a more comprehensive picture of reality. While polls measure voter preferences at a specific point in time, prediction markets reflect the aggregated expectations of participants about future outcomes. By combining insights from both methods, analysts can gain a deeper understanding of electoral dynamics and public sentiment.\n\nRole of Social Media and Online Communities \n\nSocial media and online communities play a crucial role in driving participation and engagement in prediction markets. Platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and specialized forums provide spaces for users to discuss and share information about prediction markets, influencing public perception and attracting new participants.\n\nFor example, during the 2024 US presidential election cycle, Polymarket and other prediction platforms have seen increased engagement from users sharing their market positions and discussing political developments on social media. This real-time exchange of information helps to create a dynamic feedback loop, where market prices are continuously updated based on the latest news and insights.\n\nOnline communities also foster a sense of belonging and competition among participants, encouraging them to stay engaged and contribute their knowledge. This collective participation enriches the information available to prediction markets, leading to more accurate forecasts.\n\ndApp Spotlight: Polymarket\n\nIt’s no accident that Polymarket is well-positioned for growth. A deeper look at the evolution of the platform reveals the key backers, innovative features, and strong user engagement that propel its ongoing success.\n\nFounding and Early Development\n\nPolymarket was founded in 2020 by Shayne Coplan, with the vision of creating a decentralized platform for betting on real-world events. As a blockchain-enabled platform, Polymarket offers transparency, security, and permissionless accessibility, setting itself apart from traditional prediction markets often hampered by financial regulations tied to typical forms of capital flows rather than cryptocurrency. The platform successfully raised $70 million from notable investors, including Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. This substantial financial backing has been crucial for Polymarket's rapid growth and development.\n\nVitalik Buterin has been a long-time proponent of prediction markets and has often highlighted Polymarket as an example of successful user experience (UX) improvements and a product with strong market fit. These factors have driven better mainstream adoption of a Web3 decentralized application, which is rarely seen without excessive reward incentives. Buterin's endorsement of Polymarket is significant, given his reputation for predicting the evolution of technology well before the mainstream takes notice. His support provides additional confidence in Polymarket's future success.\n\nIn May 2024, Buterin participated in Polymarket's Series B funding round, further solidifying his commitment to the platform. In a reply to Polymarket’s tweet on July 19th, Buterin praised the platform's idiosyncratic successes, stating, \"Really impressive showing from you guys. Not just predicting the outcomes well in advance, but also (through making conditional odds of different candidates visible) serving as an active input into collective decision making.\" \n\nIn July 2024, Polymarket gained significant attention by hiring Nate Silver, a renowned statistician and founder of FiveThirtyEight, as an advisor. This strategic move enhanced the platform's credibility and reinforces the overall view that prediction markets are gaining traction, while further solidifying Polymarket as the leading prediction market platform.\n\nOperational Mechanics\n\nPolymarket functions as a decentralized prediction market where users can trade shares on various events' outcomes, including political elections, sports, and cultural happenings. The platform employs blockchain technology to ensure a secure, non-custodial environment where transactions are transparent and immutable.\n\nMarket Curation: Users can propose new markets, which are then reviewed and curated by the platform’s moderators to ensure relevance, clear definitions, and binary outcomes.\n\nPlacing Bets: Participants buy shares in favor of or against a particular outcome. Each market operates with binary options like \"Yes\" or \"No\". Share prices reflect the market's consensus on the outcome's likelihood. For instance, if shares of the “YES” outcome option are priced at $0.60, the market estimates a 60% probability of that outcome.\n\nConsensus and Resolution: Polymarket uses optimistic oracles via UMA Protocol to verify event outcomes. These trusted data sources provide the necessary information to settle bets by collecting data from off-chain sources (e.g., news outlets and public records). Once an event concludes, the oracle reports the outcome to the blockchain, where smart contracts automatically resolve the market and distribute winnings.\n\nPayouts: Participants holding shares in the correct outcome receive payouts proportional to their holdings, facilitated by smart contracts that ensure fair and transparent fund distribution.\n\nLiquidity Providers and Market Makers: Polymarket uses a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) and Fixed Product Market Makers (FPMMs) to maintain liquidity and facilitate trading. Liquidity providers also earn rewards from the transaction fees paid by traders. When users provide liquidity for an event, they receive an economic reward of 2% of each transaction amount. The closer the liquidity provision price is to the final transaction price, the greater the reward. Users must pay an additional 2% to the pool if they close a contract before a market resolves (aka prior to a market reaching an event-driven resolution).\n\nFees: Polymarket currently does not charge additional fees for trading (as of this writing), though Polymarket states in its docs that this is subject to change. Polymarket’s business model is comparable to an AMM in that its primary revenue source would be through its dynamic fee schedule – charging fees to purchase binary options contracts on their platform. If enabled, Polymarket’s set fee would be levied on the proceeds of a contract. Polymarket did add fees to certain market pools in Q2 '23, but on-chain data shows that all fee generation has been paused since August 28th of that year.\n\nGiven it does not charge a fee directly, the platform has historically only generated revenue when it has acted as an independent liquidity provider. \n\nKey Features and Functionalities\n\nOutcome Tokens: Polymarket's markets utilize the Gnosis Conditional Token Framework (CTF), where binary outcomes are represented as ERC1155 tokens. These tokens can be traded on the platform, each corresponding to a specific market and outcome.\n\nPolyLend: Introduced in 2024, PolyLend is a peer-to-peer lending protocol allowing users to borrow USDC against their conditional token positions. This feature enables participants to leverage their market positions for additional capital.\n\nUser Incentives and Reward Programs: Polymarket offers various incentive programs, including market-making rewards, referral bonuses, and trading competitions, designed to boost user engagement and liquidity.\n\nGrowth and Impact\n\nSince its launch, Polymarket has experienced rapid growth in trading volume, user base, and market activity. In July 2024, it hit an all-time high of $387 million in monthly trading volumes, tripling from the $111MM in captured volume for June. Monthly volume pushed higher to $473MM in August and peaked again in September, reaching a staggering $533MM in trades. Polymarket has also witnessed similar trends in user growth. Between May 1st, 2024 and September 9th, 2024, weekly active users on the platform have grown from ~1,000 per week to ~35,000 per week – an approximate 35,000% increase in the span of 4 months. Additionally, Polymarket experienced a substantial growth in monthly active users, reaching 90,037 in September—a 41.5% increase compared to the previous month.\n\nPolitical markets have seen significant engagement. In July, more than $320 million in cumulative bets had been placed on the US presidential election winner. The decision by President Joe Biden not to seek re-election spurred record daily volumes at the time, reaching $28 million in one day.\n\nPolymarket's weekly user activity has been heavily driven by election bettors, as evidenced by the above chart, where approximately 65% of user interest is tied to election-related contracts. This is more than double the 27% recorded at the start of 2024, indicating a clear shift in user engagement toward election betting as the year has progressed. More precisely put, the new user and volume growth depicted in the previous charts is highly correlated to the US election. The dominance of election markets suggests that political events have become a key catalyst for user participation, and the platform’s overall activity is closely linked to political cycles and election-related news. \n\nThis strong correlation should not come as a surprise to those who’ve paid attention to platforms like Polymarket over the years. Every four years, prediction markets see a surge in activity due to the U.S. election cycle, as political markets become a primary driver of volume in the ~12 months leading up. While these platforms experience ebbs and flows in user participation, they rarely give back all the gains made during an election cycle. As a result, platforms like Polymarket benefit from a steady increase in mainstream prevalence over the long term, as they retain a portion of new users and liquidity, helping to fuel their continued growth beyond election seasons.\n\nOne final intriguing example of the kinds of markets that gain traction on Polymarket comes from July 18th, when a quirky market emerged following President Biden’s rough debate performance. The market posed a humorous question: “Lettuce vs. Biden - Who lasts longer?” From its creation, “Lettuce” led with a 63% probability, and just three days later, Biden announced his withdrawal from the race. Polymarket’s ability to engage with internet culture, memes, and Twitter humor allows it to craft playful, unique, and timely markets that resonate with the current zeitgeist, keeping the platform fresh and closely aligned with its user base. This “internet-native” persona has and will likely continue to be a strategic advantage that competitors may struggle to replicate.\n\nCultural Relevance and Market Curation\n\nPolymarket distinguishes itself by curating markets resonant with current cultural and political events. The platform’s moderators ensure markets are relevant and timely, often revolving around major news events, elections, and popular culture. This approach not only attracts participants but also enhances the platform's utility as a forecasting tool.\n\nFor instance, Polymarket has created markets on the 2024 US presidential election, Federal Reserve rate cuts, and significant global events like the COVID-19 pandemic. By offering markets on various topics, Polymarket caters to diverse interests and leverages its user base's collective intelligence to provide valuable future insights.\n\nUser Testimonials and Platform Impact\n\nUser testimonials highlight Polymarket's appeal and impact. Many users praise its transparency, ease of use, and the opportunity to profit from their knowledge and insights. The addition of high-profile figures like Nate Silver has further bolstered user confidence in the platform’s accuracy and reliability.\n\nOne user noted, \"Polymarket has revolutionized the way I think about forecasting. The ability to bet on real-world events and see the market's consensus in real-time provides a level of insight that traditional polls just can't match.\"\n\nOverall, the support and investment from influential figures like Vitalik Buterin, combined with Polymarket's innovative features and strong user engagement, position the platform for continued growth and success in the prediction market space.\n\nOther Industry Players & Honorable Mentions\n\nIn addition to Polymarket, several other prediction market platforms have made significant contributions to the field. This section provides condensed profiles of these platforms, highlighting their unique features, market focus, and user base. We will also compare and contrast these platforms with Polymarket, discussing their strengths, weaknesses, and market positioning, as well as exploring the potential for collaboration or competition between these platforms and Polymarket.\n\nPredictIt \n\nPredictIt is a well-known political prediction market platform based in the United States, operating under an academic exemption granted by the CFTC. Founded in 2014, PredictIt allows users to bet on political events such as elections, policy outcomes, and legislative developments. PredictIt’s detailed political markets and academic focus provide it with a niche market of politically engaged users and researchers. However, the academic exemption limits the scale of its operations, including restrictions on the number of participants and the amount of money that can be bet on each market.\n\nKalshi \n\nKalshi is a regulated prediction market platform based in the United States, offering a wide range of markets on events such as economic indicators, weather outcomes, and political events. Founded in 2018 by Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara, Kalshi operates under the regulatory oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which provides it with a unique positioning in the market. Kalshi’s regulatory approval and focus on non-political markets provide a distinct advantage in attracting users who prioritize security and regulatory compliance, although this focus may limit its market diversity compared to decentralized platforms like Polymarket.\n\nGnosis (Web3)\n\nGnosis is one of the pioneering platforms in the decentralized prediction market space, founded in 2015 by Martin Köppelmann and Stefan George. It operates on the Ethereum blockchain and has expanded its functionalities beyond prediction markets to include decentralized trading and wallet services. Gnosis leverages the Conditional Token Framework (CTF) to tokenize outcomes and offers a robust infrastructure for creating and trading prediction markets. With its native token, GNO, used for governance and staking, Gnosis has built a comprehensive ecosystem that supports a wide range of use cases. The platform's innovative use of decentralized oracles and its focus on enhancing user experience through intuitive interfaces have made it a notable player in the industry. Gnosis's emphasis on security and transparency, combined with its diverse range of successful Web3 products, positions it as a strong competitor to platforms like Polymarket. However, its broader focus on various blockchain applications means it may appeal to a different segment of users compared to more specialized prediction market platforms.\n\nAugur (Web3)\n\nLaunched in 2018, Augur is one of the pioneering blockchain-based prediction markets. Initially built on Ethereum’s mainnet, Augur operates as a permissionless platform that allows users to create their own markets using its native utility token, REP, for rewards, market creation, and dispute resolution. Augur supports binary, categorical, and scalar markets, catering to a wide range of prediction events. In 2021, Augur introduced a dedicated sportsbook platform called Augur Turbo on the Polygon network, adopting a layer-2 approach similar to Polymarket, while other markets remained on Ethereum Mainnet under the new name \"Augur Pro.\" Augur's reliance on the REP token and Ethereum L1 transaction fees has led to higher costs for users. However, its commitment to decentralization, flexibility, and diverse market options continues to attract a dedicated user base.\n\nAzuro (Web3)\n\nAzuro is a decentralized prediction market protocol launched in 2021, designed to improve liquidity and user experience through a peer-to-pool model. Azuro’s unique liquidity model allows users to pool their funds, which are then used to provide liquidity across various markets. Built on blockchain technology, Azuro ensures transparency and security for its users while emphasizing an intuitive and user-friendly interface. As a newer platform, Azuro may lack the market diversity and user base size of more established platforms like Polymarket but offers innovative liquidity management and scalability solutions.\n\nPredict.fun (Web3)\n\nPredict.fun is an upcoming prediction market platform set to launch on the emerging Blast blockchain. Similar to how pump.fun revolutionized memecoins, predict.fun’s name implies an aim to bring gamification and accessibility to the forefront of prediction markets. Similar to Polymarket, the platform will utilize the UMA protocol for oracle services and dispute resolution, however, it will also notably offer users a native yield, thanks to the unique capabilities of the Blast blockchain. Advocates of the new platform note that the yield incentives will enhance capital efficiency and improve price discovery. With its innovative approach and the growing momentum in both prediction markets and the Blast ecosystem, predict.fun is well-positioned to attract early adopters and speculators eager for the next big opportunity in the space. However, whether it can capture and sustain the trading volumes necessary to create efficient markets remains to be seen. I expect this platform is one worth watching in the months ahead.\n\nOther Notable Platforms\n\nManifold (formerly Manifold Markets): A prediction market platform that uses a play-money system to lower barriers to entry, offering an accessible and gamified experience. Manifold’s user-friendly interface and social features have fostered strong community engagement, making it popular among casual users and those new to prediction markets.\n\nHedgeHog.markets: A decentralized prediction market platform focused on sports and entertainment events, offering unique betting opportunities within niche markets. Polymarket’s broader market offerings may attract a more diverse user base.\n\nInsightPrediction: Offers markets on political and financial events with a focus on integrating market data with predictive analytics. Its integration of predictive analytics could complement Polymarket’s market data, offering potential for collaboration.\n\nFutuur: An international prediction market platform with a focus on a wide range of topics, including politics, sports, and entertainment. Futuur’s global reach and market diversity align closely with Polymarket, suggesting potential competition for international users.\n\nSX.Bet: A sports-focused crypto market that allows users to bet on various sports outcomes using blockchain technology to ensure transparency. While SX.Bet focuses on sports, Polymarket’s broader range of markets may appeal to users interested in non-sports events.\n\nSummary: Competitive Landscape\n\nThe landscape of prediction markets is diverse, with each platform offering unique features and catering to different user interests. Kalshi’s regulatory compliance, PredictIt’s political focus, and Azuro’s innovative liquidity model highlight the variety within the industry. While each platform has its strengths and weaknesses, they collectively contribute to the growth and evolution of prediction markets.\n\nThe prediction markets on PredictIt, Kalshi, and Polymarket are most often cited by traditional media outlets, thus garnering more mainstream appeal than the other platforms listed (though Augur and Gnosis are both well-respected within the crypto industry). Of the three, Polymarket stands out as the only Web3 platform, leveraging its decentralized approach, broad market offerings, and intuitive UX to attract a diverse and engaged user base. Comparing these platforms with Polymarket reveals both opportunities for collaboration and areas of competition. The well-executed strategic differentiators that fueled the platform’s mainstream breakout underscore a competent leadership team capable of maintaining its position at the forefront of the industry. \n\nBroad Impacts\n\nPrediction markets extend far beyond political betting, with significant implications for sectors like finance, sports, entertainment, and public policy. While niche platforms may excel in specialized areas, the future of prediction markets likely follows a 'winner-takes-most' trajectory. This is driven by the clear correlation between increased trading volume and market efficiency, resulting in superior predictive ability. When all is said and done, the platforms with the greatest liquidity and user base will maintain a competitive advantage in delivering reliable forecasts across multiple domains – as well as capture the lionshare of media attention. \n\nImplications by Sector\n\nBy taking a longer-term view, it isn’t difficult to recognize how prediction markets may demonstrate their utility across a wide range of sectors in the future, offering valuable insights and influencing decision-making processes.\n\nFinance: Prediction markets can offer real-time forecasts on economic indicators, stock prices, and other financial metrics. By aggregating diverse opinions and leveraging crowd wisdom, these markets can provide early warnings of economic shifts, helping investors and policymakers make informed decisions. Many popular platforms now offer markets on US Federal Reserve rate decisions, as well as other key economic indicators. One of the most actively traded markets globally is the CME Group’s 30-day Federal Funds Futures contract, which functions similarly to a prediction market and is visualized through the CME FedWatch Tool, allowing traders to assess the likelihood of upcoming rate changes.\n\nSports: In the sports industry, prediction markets can be used to forecast game outcomes, player performance, and other related events. Platforms like SX.Bet specialize in sports betting, providing a decentralized and transparent way for fans to engage with their favorite sports. These markets can also offer insights into team strategies and player conditions, potentially influencing coaching decisions and team management.\n\nEntertainment: The Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX) is a prime example of how prediction markets can be applied to the entertainment industry. By allowing participants to trade shares in movies, actors, and other entertainment properties, the HSX has accurately predicted box office performance and award winners. This information can be valuable for studios and investors when deciding which projects to greenlight and how to allocate resources.\n\nPublic Policy: Prediction markets have significant potential in the realm of public policy. For example, policy markets, as envisioned by Robin Hanson, could estimate the outcomes of various policy decisions, providing data-driven insights to policymakers. By betting on policy outcomes, participants can help forecast the effectiveness of different policy options, aiding in the formulation of more effective and evidence-based public policies.\n\nSocietal Impact of Widespread Adoption\n\nThe widespread adoption of prediction markets could have profound societal impacts, particularly in how public opinion is formed and how decisions are made.\n\nChanges in Public Opinion Formation: Prediction markets offer a real-time and dynamic reflection of public sentiment, which can significantly influence how opinions are formed and disseminated. Traditional polls provide static snapshots, whereas prediction markets continuously update, incorporating the latest information and participant insights. This dynamic nature can lead to a more informed and engaged public, as individuals have access to constantly evolving data reflecting collective expectations.\n\nEnhanced Decision-Making Processes: The integration of prediction markets into decision-making processes can lead to more informed and rational decisions. By aggregating the diverse opinions and knowledge of participants, prediction markets can provide more accurate forecasts and identify potential risks and opportunities. This capability can be particularly valuable in areas such as corporate strategy, public policy, and investment decisions, where accurate predictions are crucial.\n\nDemocratization of Information: Prediction markets democratize access to information by allowing anyone with internet access to participate. This inclusivity can lead to a broader range of perspectives being considered, enhancing the quality and reliability of the forecasts generated. As more people engage with these markets, the collective intelligence of the crowd becomes a powerful tool for forecasting and decision-making.\n\nEfficiency and Accuracy: The Case for Winner-Take-Most\n\nThe accuracy of prediction markets is closely tied to their liquidity. Higher liquidity ensures that markets are more resilient to manipulation and can better aggregate diverse opinions, leading to more accurate forecasts. This dynamic creates a potential \"winner-take-most\" scenario, where a few platforms dominate the market due to their superior liquidity and accuracy.\n\nPolymarket's success exemplifies this trend. With substantial trading volumes and a broad user base, Polymarket has established itself as a leading platform for political betting markets. Its ability to attract significant liquidity has enhanced its predictive accuracy, making it a trusted source for forecasting political outcomes. As the industry matures, it is likely that a small number of well-capitalized and liquid platforms will emerge as the dominant players, shaping the future of prediction markets.\n\nThe Arguments Against Prediction Markets\n\nCritics of prediction markets often cite specific instances where these platforms have failed to accurately predict political outcomes, using these examples to argue against their overall predictive power. Below are two public criticisms that have emerged in recent weeks, in response Kamala Harris’ selection of Tim Walz – considered a true “dark-horse” in the VP race – as her running mate:\n\nWalz's Unexpected Selection: One user pointed out that Polymarket had Minnesota Governor Tim Walz at just 3% odds of being chosen as Kamala Harris's running mate mere days before the official announcement. This led the user to suggest that \"degenerate gamblers\" might not be the best at predicting future political outcomes, implying that prediction markets are fundamentally flawed as forecasting tools.\n\nReactionary Nature of Prediction Markets: Another user criticized prediction markets more broadly, arguing that these platforms are not truly predictive but rather reactive to news developments. The user stated that unless there is widespread insider trading (which is unlikely to occur at scale in high-stakes markets due to the risks involved), prediction markets merely mirror the prevailing news narratives rather than providing forward-looking insights.\n\nRebuttal: Why These Critiques Are Misleading\n\nWhile these critiques are understandable given the unexpected nature of Tim Walz's selection, they fail to account for the inherent challenges in predicting vice-presidential picks and overlook the broader utility of prediction markets.\n\nInherent Uncertainty in VP Picks & Limited Data: Vice-presidential selections are notoriously difficult to predict due to the highly secretive nature of the decision-making process. Typically, only a small circle of advisors is involved, and the final choice rests solely with the presidential candidate. This decision can be influenced by personal preferences, strategic considerations, or external factors that are not publicly known or easily anticipated. Furthermore, the decision-making process often prioritizes factors unrelated to swing state advantages, making it even harder for prediction markets to accurately narrow down a list of potential running mates. The challenge is compounded by the limited access to reliable data. Unlike larger political events, such as elections that involve millions of participants and more prescient polling data. \n\nAs recently highlighted in the well-respected UVA political publication, Sabato's Crystal Ball, Kamala Harris's selection of Tim Walz was shaped by a constrained timeline and specific political considerations, many of which could not be effectively defined and disseminated to the broader public in such a short amount of time. \n\nThe Role of Gut Instincts in Decision-Making: Presidential candidates may prioritize different factors when selecting their running mates. Some may rely heavily on data and polling, while others might follow their instincts or prioritize personal relationships. This variability further complicates the predictive process, making it difficult for markets to accurately forecast such decisions. In Walz's case, his selection may have been influenced by factors that were not visible to the public or easily quantifiable, such as his background, compatibility with Harris, or his ability to appeal to centrist voters.\n\nPrediction Markets as a Complementary Tool: Prediction markets should not be viewed as standalone predictors of specific events like VP picks, which are shrouded in secrecy. Instead, they are most valuable when used as part of a broader analytical toolkit, providing insights into the collective sentiment of informed participants. While they may not always get it right in cases of high uncertainty, they are effective at aggregating diverse opinions and adjusting quickly to new information.\n\nOutlier Events Do Not Define Predictive Power: Finally, it's important to recognize that outlier events, such as an unexpected VP pick, do not invalidate the broader predictive power of markets. In many cases, prediction markets have accurately forecasted complex political outcomes, outperforming traditional polls and expert analyses. The failure to predict Walz's selection is a reminder of the limitations that all forecasting tools face when dealing with low-information, high-uncertainty scenarios, rather than a wholesale indictment of prediction markets.\n\nIt’s true that on August 1st, Polymarket had Tim Walz’s odds of being chosen as Kamala Harris’s VP at only 5%, just five days before the official announcement on August 6th. However, by the day before the announcement, August 5th, those odds had shifted dramatically, with Walz’s odds effectively matching the longstanding frontrunner, Josh Shapiro (who had peaked at ~77% on July 31st).\n\nThroughout the day of August 5th, the odds for Walz and Shapiro fluctuated, reflecting the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent  to the VP selection process. Notably, Walz’s odds eventually peaked at 60% that afternoon, at one point overtaking Shapiro’s, which is significant because it suggests that the market was able to anticipate the shift in Harris’s thinking in favor of Walz before she had even finalized her decision. This flip was driven by a mix of subjective data, including positive reports about Walz’s interview performance, coinciding with negative signals regarding Shapiro. The market's ability to reflect these dynamics highlights its strength in processing and responding to nuanced information, even in situations where the decision-maker has not yet reached a conclusion.\n\nFor a more detailed analysis of Polymarket's data and its predictive power of the VP selection process, be sure to check out their recent post in their newsletter. It includes insights that highlight the value of prediction markets – especially, the value of using the graphical trends as indicators, rather than simply the headline numbers. An excerpt:\n\n“Looking back at the chart, we can see several key moments where the Polymarket odds were ahead of the conventional wisdom. They:\n\nTook Walz seriously at a time when many pundits were focusing on Shapiro or Kelly, showing him moving up as 'weird' went viral\n\nCalled out the decline of Mark Kelly amid the barrage of oppo research\n\nFlagged the serious last-minute troubles with Shapiro and the final Walz surge.”\n\nThe True Weaknesses and Shortcomings Faced by Prediction Markets\n\nIn many respects, prediction markets are subject to challenges that mirror those in AI, where bias, technical, and regulatory issues combine to present significant barriers to entry.\n\nDemographic Pool Biases and Emotional Influence\n\nPrediction markets are often influenced by the demographic makeup of their participants, particularly in highly emotional contexts like US presidential elections. These markets, similar to the most intense sporting events, are driven by partisan emotions, leading to outcomes that may reflect more of the participants' biases rather than objective probabilities. This emotional bias is further amplified by the fact that many market participants may be more motivated by their hopes or fears rather than dispassionate analysis, leading to distorted market outcomes.\n\nCopy-Trading, Recency Bias, and Speculation\n\nPrediction markets are also susceptible to the pitfalls of copy-trading, recency bias, and speculative behavior. Participants often follow the crowd, leading to exaggerated trends and price swings. This behavior can cause the market to overreact to recent events or prevailing sentiments, pushing prices too far in one direction and creating inefficiencies. Unless there is ample liquidity and active market-making to counterbalance these trends, the market's predictive accuracy can be significantly compromised.\n\nDispute Resolution in Nuanced Political Events and Bias in Oracle Decisions\n\nOne of the critical weaknesses in prediction markets is the challenge of resolving disputes in complex or nuanced political events. A recent example is the contested Venezuelan election, where the UMA protocol resolved the market in favor of the opposition political party after ample evidence showed the initial election results had been falsified, despite ongoing disputes and no indication that President Maduro will ultimately step down. This decision illustrates the difficulty in adjudicating such events, where outcomes are complicated by unforeseen circumstances. Moreover, oracles like UMA, designed to provide unbiased resolutions during disputes through tokenholder votes, can still be influenced by the human biases of stakeholders, potentially undermining the integrity of prediction markets. This bias in oracle decisions, which accumulate news data off-chain, can lead to dissatisfaction among participants and erode confidence in the fairness and accuracy of these platforms.\n\nProduct Headwinds & Risks Faced by Prediction Markets\n\nPrediction markets, despite their growing popularity and utility, face several significant challenges. These challenges range from technical and operational issues to regulatory and legal hurdles. This section will explore the primary challenges, focusing on regulatory actions taken by government agencies against various prediction markets, and compare the regulatory landscape in the United States with the generally more favorable international environment.\n\nTechnical and Operational Challenges\n\nPrediction markets rely heavily on technology to operate efficiently and securely. Key technical challenges include:\n\nScalability: As the number of users and transactions increases, prediction markets must scale their infrastructure to handle the load without compromising performance. After all, Prediction Markets could one day compete with sports betting platforms as well as traditional options exchanges.\n\nSecurity: Ensuring the security of user funds and data is paramount. Prediction markets are attractive targets for hackers, making robust security measures essential.\n\nUser Interface and Experience: Simplifying the user interface and improving user experience can help attract and retain participants. Complex interfaces can deter potential users from engaging with the platform, particularly as these platforms push towards more casual betting markets and broader user bases.\n\nRegulatory and Legal Hurdles\n\nOne of the most significant challenges facing prediction markets is navigating the complex regulatory landscape. This section will detail specific examples of regulatory actions and compare the regulatory environments in the United States and internationally.\n\nUnited States Regulatory Landscape\n\nIn the United States, prediction markets face stringent regulatory scrutiny, primarily from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Several key regulatory actions highlight the challenges these markets face:\n\nPolymarket:\n\nIn January 2022, the CFTC ordered Polymarket to pay a $1.4 million civil monetary penalty for offering off-exchange event-based binary options contracts without the necessary registration as a designated contract market (DCM) or swap execution facility (SEF). The CFTC's order required Polymarket to wind down all non-compliant markets on its platform and cease violating the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and applicable CFTC regulations​.\n\nPredictIt:\n\nPredictIt, a popular political prediction market, operated under a no-action letter issued by the CFTC in 2014, allowing it to function as a not-for-profit event contract market for educational purposes. However, in 2022, the CFTC withdrew this no-action letter, citing violations of its conditions. The withdrawal significantly impacted PredictIt's operations and its ability to offer political event contracts in the US.​\n\nKalshi:\n\nKalshi is the only prediction market currently approved by the CFTC to operate a contract market. Despite this approval, Kalshi faced significant regulatory hurdles when it sought to expand into political event markets. In 2023, the CFTC denied Kalshi's request to offer event contracts on congressional control, following pushback from legislators who argued that such contracts could undermine the democratic process​.\n\nThese examples illustrate the cautious approach US regulators take toward prediction markets, particularly those involving political events. The primary concerns include the potential for market manipulation, ethical issues, and the influence of financial incentives on democratic processes. The wary reluctance expressed by US regulators is nothing new, as noted earlier when covering the history of prediction markets. However, there is a general belief that the US is on a path towards greater acceptance of these types of contracts and derivatives as public interest continues to grow. The massive rise in the US sports betting industry highlights that there is precedence for such a shift in policy.\n\nInternational Regulatory Landscape\n\nIn contrast to the US, the international regulatory environment for prediction markets is generally more favorable. Several countries have adopted a more progressive stance, recognizing the potential benefits of these markets:\n\nUnited Kingdom:\n\nThe UK has a more lenient regulatory approach towards prediction markets, particularly those operated by established betting firms. Platforms like Smarkets and Betfair offer political betting markets with fewer regulatory constraints compared to their US counterparts.\n\nNew Zealand:\n\nThe University of Wellington operates the New Zealand-based prediction market, iPredict, which has faced fewer regulatory challenges than similar markets in the US. This more relaxed regulatory environment has allowed iPredict to offer a wide range of event contracts, including political outcomes, without significant interference​.\n\nEstonia:\n\nEstonia has emerged as a hub for innovative fintech and blockchain projects, including prediction markets. The country's supportive regulatory framework encourages the development and operation of decentralized platforms, making it an attractive destination for prediction market startups.\n\nThe international regulatory landscape's relative friendliness towards prediction markets allows these platforms to innovate and expand more freely. This contrast highlights the challenges US-based prediction markets face in achieving similar growth and acceptance.\n\nFuture Prospects for Prediction Markets\n\nAs prediction markets continue to evolve, they’re likely to see more community-based curation, improvements in data quality from oracles, and continued feature evolution, including increased use of AI.\n\nUser-Sourced Market Curation\n\nOne of the most exciting prospects for prediction markets is user-sourced market curation. Platforms like Polymarket are already seeking new market requests from their community, but this process could become more decentralized and user-driven. By leveraging the collective intelligence and interests of users, platforms can offer a wider variety of markets, ensuring they remain relevant and engaging. Users could vote on proposed markets or even create and manage their own, incentivizing active participation and enhancing the platform's relevance.\n\nImprovements in Oracle Technologies\n\nOracles, which provide the data needed to resolve prediction markets, are critical for their accuracy and reliability. Advances in oracle technologies, such as decentralized oracles and improved data verification methods, could significantly enhance the trustworthiness of prediction markets. Enhanced data verification methods, including cross-referencing multiple data sources and using advanced machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies, can improve the accuracy and reliability of oracle data. These advancements will ensure market outcomes are based on accurate and unbiased data, further solidifying the role of prediction markets as reliable forecasting tools.\n\nNew Features and Services\n\nThe introduction of new features and services can also drive the growth of prediction markets. For example, PolyLend, a peer-to-peer lending protocol that allows users to borrow against their conditional token positions, represents a significant innovation. By enabling users to leverage their market positions for additional liquidity, platforms can offer more flexibility and financing options while generating new revenue streams in the process.\n\nAdditionally, innovative financial services such as hedging tools, insurance products, and fractional ownership of market positions, can attract more sophisticated users and investors to prediction markets. By offering adjacent services, platforms focused on differentiating through a decentralized operating model can both draw in a wider user base while also showcasing the inherent advantages of democratized systems. \n\nThe Impact of Artificial Intelligence\n\nAI has the potential to revolutionize prediction markets by enhancing various aspects of their operation and user experience. The integration of AI can lead to the creation of markets at a microscopic scale, making them more personalized and relevant to individual users.\n\nContent Creator AIs: AI can assist in creating content beyond human capabilities. By analyzing trends from news, social media, and financial data, AI can suggest timely and relevant event topics. This can lead to the creation of highly relevant markets that attract niche audiences and drive participation and volume. Community feedback enhances the AI’s understanding, making it an iteratively improving content creation engine that bonds content creators and their audiences.\n\nEvent Recommendation AIs: AI can tailor event suggestions to users based on their interests, trading history, and specific needs. By focusing on recommending events ripe for debate and trading opportunities, AI can adapt to users’ behaviors across different regions, cultural contexts, and times, leading to a highly targeted feed of events, free from irrelevant content.\n\nLiquidity Allocator AIs: AI can optimize liquidity injections to narrow the bid-ask spread and minimize risk. By implementing the logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR) AMM model, AI can manage event liquidity from a general LP pool, rewarding contributions with accrued fee revenue or platform tokens. This reduces slippage and ensures better price stability.\n\nInformation Aggregation AIs: AI can harness data from various indicators (e.g., on-chain data, historical data, news, sentiment indicators) to provide a comprehensive understanding of events. This enables players to make confident bets based on well-rounded projections. Information aggregation AIs can turn prediction markets into the go-to source for informed decision-making, with potential projects to token-gate access to AI-generated insights.\n\nAI as Arbiters: In cases of disputes in prediction markets, AI can serve as impartial arbiters. Using multi-round dispute systems similar to Kleros, AI can resolve disputes efficiently and without bias, reducing the need for human arbitration, which can be slow, expensive, and subject to biases.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nPrediction markets have come a long way from their experimental days of the '90s through early aughts, evolving into sophisticated platforms that leverage collective intelligence to provide accurate forecasts across various domains. As we look to the future, the growth and impact of decentralized prediction market platforms like Polymarket suggest their significant potential to become mainstream tools for forecasting and decision-making. Their ability to aggregate diverse opinions and provide real-time insights makes them powerful tools for both individuals and organizations. The potential for user-sourced market curation, advances in oracle technologies, new financial services like PolyLend, and the transformative impact of AI will further enhance the value and relevance of prediction markets.\n\nReflecting on the words of Ben Graham – the “father of value investing” – as cited by his protégé, Warren Buffet in his 1987 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders: “The market may ignore business success for a while, but eventually will confirm it. As Ben said: ‘In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine.’” \n\nWhile the minute-by-minute movements in prediction markets may at times be fairly cast aside as “noise” driven by overreaction, speculation, and copy-trades, these markets can help better ascertain “truth” by looking at the directional moves when zoomed out to a daily, weekly, or monthly chart. Trying to analyze a handful of bets, much like analyzing a small polling sample, is a fool's errand, given that those bets are not representative of the collective. But, by zooming out, one unleashes the power of the internet – the power of crowdsourced information.\n\nIn short, prediction markets represent a powerful tool for aggregating collective wisdom and providing real-time insights into future events. As the internet continues to facilitate the proliferation of these markets, their role in shaping public perception, influencing decision-making, and forecasting outcomes will only grow. By understanding the dynamics driving their growth and addressing the challenges they face, we can unlock the full potential of prediction markets and harness their power to predict the future.\n\nReferences\n\nRoeder, O.

The origins of written language can be traced back to  ledgers, dating back thousands of years to Sumerian Cuneiform in ancient Mesopotamia, where signs recorded on clay tablets were used to keep track of the ownership of livestock and commodities. Doing so effectively allowed the Sumerians to become the most advanced ancient civilization at the time, as they were now able to efficiently manage economic resources, facilitate trade and taxation, and allocate goods and labor within city-states. \n\nThe ability to accurately record and verify asset ownership ultimately formed the backbone of civil societies and modern economies. Without such a mechanism, chaos ensues. The tulip mania bubble, the stock market crash of 1929, and the great financial crisis of 2008, are all premier historical examples of the consequences in failing to provide reliable settlement and ownership guarantees of economic assets.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

Technological innovation may often conform to fit within an existing market structure, or conversely new technologies may create opportunities to disrupt a market's existing structure, transforming its underlying architecture, operations, and the actors involved. \n\nOften, adoption of new technologies in the financial services sector was not voluntary, but instead a response to critical situations in dire need of fixing. The Paperwork Crunch of the 60s led to the launch of NASDAQ, the world’s \"first electronic stock market\", in 1971. This marked the biggest transformation of securities trade clearing and settlement systems to date. In 1973, the Depository Trust Company (DTC) was founded to remove the mobility of certificate transfers by custodying certificates in a single depository with a unified accounting ledger. However, it wasn’t until after 9/11 and the grounding of air travel in the US that the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act was passed, making it legally permissible to clear images of paper checks instead of the paper copy itself. It took the flooding of the DTCC vaults during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which saw nearly 1.7 million security certificates damaged, to shift away from paper checks altogether. \n\nFast forward to today and there is still much room for improvement. Data from the DTCC shows the real cost associated with the difficulties of this rather complex and antiquated system, with upwards of tens of billions US dollars failing to deliver a trade contract on a daily basis. \n\nThe associated risks are well-explained by the DTCC: “Not only does the original trade fail, but the party that bought the securities may have already pledged them in a subsequent trade, and now that trade too will involve a failure-to-deliver, thus creating a cascading effect.” \n\nThis begs the question – do blockchains fix this? \n\nThe Role of Tokenization \n\nAt a high level, tokenization is the process of encoding assets of economic value, as well as their associated ownership claims, on a blockchain. Blockchains are digital distributed ledgers that record and store transactional information, providing immutability (barring a theoretical but increasingly difficult or costly attack vector), and transparency of events, which in turn enables public observability, wherein anyone can observe and verify whether an event took place or not. \n\n‘Real-world assets' , or RWAs, have become a colloquial term for the various non-crypto assets that can be tokenized. (Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital points out that the use of ‘real-world’ is redundant “You are telling the people who are not in crypto that you do not live in the real world, and that you want the real world to come to bizarro crypto world”, but for the sake of convenience this paper will continue to use the term RWAs. ) Real-world assets can range from financial assets such as fiat currencies, commodities, equities, and bonds to illiquid assets such as real estate.\n\nThe design of blockchains offer a number of compelling benefits for tokenizing RWAs and virtually any tradable asset. For starters, the atomic nature of blockchains mitigates the principal settlement risks of delivery-versus-payment systems, as blockchain transactions often exist as multi-legged operations wherein either all legs succeed or none do at all the transaction fails. Using blockchains also eliminates the need for various layers of intermediaries, thereby reducing costs for buyers and sellers. In turn, this allows for improved efficiency in markets that oversee the buying and selling of various assets. Greater efficiency, coupled with the transparency of information that blockchains provide, unlocks new opportunities for accessibility of financial assets. Another key benefit that can be realized from tokenization is increased liquidity, wherein easier access to certain asset classes allows for a greater number of potential market participants therein allowing liquidity for their markets to grow and deepen over time. This goes hand in hand with the onset of fractional ownership, which has yielded tremendous results for the “new generation” of financial services businesses like Robinhood. \n\nTokenization is not a new concept. One could argue that the history of tokenization can be traced back to Colored Coins on Bitcoin; the core idea, proposed in a 2012 research paper by Meni Rosenfeld, was to \"color\" a small fraction of a Bitcoin with additional metadata, effectively creating a unique token that could represent ownership of an asset other than Bitcoin itself, such as commodities, stocks, or bonds. Though there was a significant amount of development around colored coins at the time, the idea was made obsolete by further developments in the crypto industry.. Another early iteration of tokenization was DigixDAO,  founded in Singapore in 2014, which was the first crowdsale and major DAO on Ethereum. Digix would allow for the public verification of an asset’s existence through its chain of custody via its Proof of Provenance (PoP) protocol, built on top of Ethereum and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Tether has been minting USDT onchain by depositing an equivalent amount of fiat currency into their reserve bank accounts and then issuing the corresponding amount of USDT tokens on the blockchain since 2015. Circle has been doing the same since 2018 with USDC. At the time of writing, the total value of RWAs onchain exceeds $175B, with stablecoins accounting for an overwhelming majority of this number ($164B), as per the Rwa.xyz dashboard. \n\nWhere Tokenization Falls Short\n\nThe tokenization of financial assets such as fiat currencies, commodities, equities, and bonds, is believed by some, including Larry Fink, to be the future of the financial industry. In theory, anything and everything of economic value can be tokenized. However, as compelling as some of the key benefits to trading assets on a blockchain may be, it’s important to consider the shortcomings of tokenization, and consequently, consider if there are alternative financial instruments which may enable trading assets on blockchains even more effectively. \n\nOverall, tokenizing RWAs requires significant effort and diligence to manage, from an operational and custodial perspective. In order to ensure tokenized assets accurately reflect their physical underlying counterparts, token issuers must either purchase the underlying every time a new token is minted, or sell every time a token is burned. Depending on the asset in question, issuers must also be able to manage any operations pertaining to the physical asset (i.e. precious metals token issuers must manage the storage, insurance, delivery, and sourcing of the metals in addition to managing the asset’s reserves).  Overall, this can be an arduous task that incurs high costs and requires significant time to implement in practice, especially at a scalable level. \n\nThe adoption of tokenized assets will also require significant progress and action from a regulatory and legal perspective, which can often be a long process as it varies by different nations and regions. In the US, the past four years have been largely unfavorable for  crypto products and services. Meanwhile over in the EU, the MiCA regulation framework is set to take place by the end of the year, while Singapore and Hong Kong have been embracing more crypto-friendly policies. Determining ownership rights and handling ensuing disputes also bring about legal complications, and local laws and regulations (i.e. at the state or city level) make this even trickier. \n\nWhat if, instead of ownership, investors simply want to get price exposure to these assets in an easier, less costly, and overall more efficient way? This is where synthetics come in. Synthetics are financial instruments built to mimic the value of an underlying asset without requiring said asset to be held by the investor. Synthetics can be created and traded on a blockchain without actually needing to go through any of the logistically complex processes involved with tokenization, allowing for the streamlined creation of onchain markets. To this day, only one type of synthetic derivative has been particularly successful - and so, all roads lead to perps. \n\nThe Role of Perpetuals \n\nPerpetual contracts (perps) are a type of derivatives contract which allow investors to speculate on an asset’s future price without a predefined expiry. These financial instruments can be held indefinitely, a key distinction from traditional derivatives contracts which involve an expiration date, before or during which the contract must be settled. Similar to contracts-for-difference (CFDs), perpetuals provide a financial instrument for investors to speculate on an asset’s price movement for an indefinite period with leverage, but do so while maintaining a single uniform contract.\n\nThough a great deal of inspiration was taken from the Undated Futures market by the Chinese Gold and Silver exchange of Hong Kong, perpetual futures were first introduced by Robert Shiller in a 1992 research paper, in response to a lack of liquid derivatives markets for many of the components of global wealth such as human capital/labor costs, real estate, private financial assets, and macroeconomic indices. \n\n“To create a market for the present value of a cash flow represented by some dividends or rent index, we need to create a perpetual claim on a cash flow represented by the index.” - Shiller\n\nShiller's motivation was to address the absence of hedging instruments for infrequently-priced, illiquid markets, proposing perpetual futures contracts as superior comprehensive risk management tools, which could be used across a wide range of use cases such as labor cost markets, commercial real estate, commodities and agriculture, to name a few. Given that these markets often faced significant spreads, Shiller believed perpetual contracts could provide great cost savings for hedgers and reduce basis risk. In short, perpetual futures aim to facilitate price discovery for assets with illiquid or hard-to-measure prices.\n\nUnfortunately for Shiller, the difficulties associated with implementing perpetual futures contracts hindered their adoption in capital markets and the financial services sector. This included regulatory hurdles, a lack of sufficient infrastructure, complexity in appropriately pricing underlying assets, to name a few, but in the end, perpetual futures were traded almost exclusively in over the counter (OTC) markets. \n\nBelieve it or not, the first use-case for perpetuals was trading crypto, and it remains the only active use-case to date. \n\nPerpetuals in Crypto\n\nIn 2011, Alexey Bragin sought a way to differentiate his Bitcoin futures ICBIT exchange from the rest of the market, which led to the creation of the \"inverse perpetual\" in which the contract was settled in Bitcoin but priced in USD. However, it wasn’t until BitMEX rolled out XBTUSD, their first perpetual leveraged swap product, that perpetuals started to pick up significant adoption. BitMEX rebranded their derivatives contract as the Perpetual Swap and introduced features aimed to attract smaller, crypto-native traders as opposed to larger financial institutions, including small contract sizes, a bitcoin-inspired contract design, minimal margins, and lower trading fees. \n\nAt this time, crypto was mostly being traded off-chain via centralized exchanges (CEXs), though this would soon begin to change with the rise of spot decentralized exchanges (DEXs) in the late 2010s. At their core, DEXs were simply sets of smart contracts coupled with an interface for users to interact with from their wallets, enabling anyone to trade any supported asset while retaining full custody over their assets. The first derivatives DEX came about in August 2017 when Antonio Juliano launched dYdX, on Ethereum, which eventually shifted its focus to become the first perpetuals DEX in April 2021 with dYdX v3. \n\nSince then, the number of perps DEXs has continued to grow with the rise of L2s, and onchain perps have seen over $2.7T in trading volume lifetime, per Artemis. \n\nThere are some key features that perpetual exchanges have in common, such as the funding rate, the underlying price discovery mechanism. Perpetuals lack an expiry and therefore require an ongoing payment mechanism in which the counterparties pay one another depending on market conditions at a given time. When the funding rate is positive,  longs pay shorts. When the funding rate is negative, shorts pay longs.\n\nThat said, the rising number of perp DEXs has led to a variety of implementations in design and function worth dissecting. \n\nOrder Book \n\nOrder books have long since been the default price discovery mechanism for exchanges, wherein buy and sell orders are listed and matched on a unified matching engine. One common adaptation of this model with perps has been to utilize off-chain orderbooks for trade matching, while execution and settling trades onchain. This model enabled protocols to avoid incurring gas fees and being hindered by network performance, while still benefiting from the transparency of onchain settlement and self-custody for traders. Taking this further are fully onchain orderbooks, in which the matching of trades is also performed onchain. This model has historically been challenging to implement, as the latency and throughput constraints of the underlying chains made it viable for sophisticated actors to perform frontrunning and sandwiching attacks and extract value at the expense of uninformed retail traders who in turn received worse price settlement on trades. However, the rise of high-performance execution environments - whether it be new general-purpose L1s, app-specific chains, or rollups -  seeks to alleviate this issue by significantly reducing block times therefore minimizing information asymmetries among market participants. \n\nPeer-to-Pool \n\nPeer-to-pool perp DEXs utilize a self-matching algorithm where buy and sell orders are routed through a central liquidity pool, and matched using a price feed oracle. Pioneered by GMX, this model employed two counterparties to operate- liquidity providers (LPs) who would lend capital to the central pool, and traders who would utilize this capital to fulfill their trades. Though LPs bear inventory risk, they are subsided by a combination of trading fees, liquidation rewards, and funding fees for doing so, while traders benefit from price execution at real-time price indices with lower slippage. However, this dynamic created an adversarial environment between LPs and traders: LPs profited from traders’ negative PnL, but suffered from pool rebalances when traders were profitable. \n\nVirtual AMM \n\nAnother design implementation that has emerged in the perp DEX landscape is the virtual AMM (vAMM) pioneered by Perpetual Protocol (great name). Similar to Peer-to-Pool, vAMMs utilize a two-counterparty system composed of LPs and traders. Rather than utilizing real tokens for liquidity, however, vAMMs utilize virtual, synthetic assets (i.e. perps). In this model there is no actual liquidity pool in the protocol; traders are able to make leveraged trades on assets which are stored in a smart contract vault. \n\nPerp DEXs have come a long way since their inception, but their potential has still been largely untapped as they have been constrained to trading crypto assets. Let’s dive into one particular protocol seeking to extend the utilities of onchain perps beyond crypto assets, to be able to trade virtually everything in one’s eToro account onchain - Ostium Protocol. \n\nOstium Protocol Deep Dive\nWhat is Ostium? \n\nThe Ostium Protocol is an open-source decentralized exchange for trading blue-chip crypto assets and RWAs as perpetual contracts onchain. At its core, the protocol functions as a set of smart contracts that live on the Arbitrum Layer 2, made up of a trading engine and a liquidity layer, as well as an in-house oracle and automated keeper system, key supporting infrastructure components. Putting it all together, the protocol provides several key offerings: virtual exposure to off-chain assets that do not natively exist onchain, a Shared Liquidity Layer made up of two capital pools (the Liquidity Buffer + the Market Making Vault) to settle trades and function as counterparties to traders, near sub-second price feeds enabled by a dual oracle system, automation for key trading features including liquidations, stop and limit orders, and a strategic risk-adjusted fee structure to capture and minimize the directional risk an open position poses to the Shared Liquidity Layer. \n\nFrom a design perspective Ostium chose to utilize a peer-to-pool model, though with its own unique twist which will be elaborated on further below. Choosing a peer-to-pool model makes sense given that markets are simply not yet mature enough to market-make for long-tail assets like soybeans or hog prices; utilizing a shared liquidity layer for price discovery allows for a more scalable defi-native model instead. \n\nOstium’s Vision \n\nOstium believes the best way to serve demand among traders for leveraged, short- and mid-term price exposure to RWAs onchain is via oracle-based perpetuals. Its goal is simple too: become the go-to destination for trading virtually any asset as an oracle-based perpetual contract. \n\nThe crypto markets and the macroeconomic environment are increasingly converging, and the post-pandemic macroeconomic landscape has wet the appetites of an increasing number of macro-aware traders. Crypto’s reaction to the unwind of the Yen carry trade and the Nikkei is a telling example; if one were to go around telling altcoin traders to keep track of what the Bank of Japan was doing as it would have critical implications for the performance of their tokens, they’d be laughed out of the room. Last week, however, this theory was proven to be correct. The incredible rise of Polymarket in the US election year has also demonstrated the appetite for speculating on the outcome of real-world events; in fact there has even been a positive correlation between the price of BTC and Donald Trump’s presidency odds. \n\nOstium puts forth the notion that perpetual contracts will reign as the superior financial instrument for enabling a proliferation of capital markets on the blockchain. \n\nTweet\n\nLet’s dive deeper into the various components that work together to enable this vision. \n\nKey Protocol Components \nOstium Trading Engine\n\nThe Ostium trading engine is the key feature of the Ostium protocol, facilitating the trade of the protocol’s supported assets by coordinating interaction between traders and LPs. \n\nUpon depositing collateral, traders can choose to go long or short; place a market, limit, or stop order, and customize their leverage settings (Ostium offers up to 200x). Gelato Functions are used to continuously track price changes and determine the need for automated order execution (liquidations, stop losses, take profit orders), while prices are called on-demand using a pull-based oracle mechanism. While their position is open, users can update their positions (Update Take Profit, Update Stop Loss, or Add Collateral) without incurring additional fees. Positions can be closed either manually or automatically; triggered by either a Stop Loss order (negative PnL), Take Profit (positive PnL) order, or Liquidation. If the value of a trader's collateral has decreased by 90%, the Keepers trigger a liquidation event, in which the remaining collateral (10%) is transferred to the Market Making Vault as a liquidation reward. \n\nOpen Price and Price Impact \n\nTo protect LP capital from the associated risks of peer-to-pool based pricing models, Ostium implements a methodology for price discovery which incorporates real-time market liquidity conditions when determining the price at which a trader opens a position. While the mid-price is often used as a neutral valuation metric, relying solely on it can be misleading in scenarios where liquidity significantly affects the quality of execution a trader receives. Instead, Ostium employs a scaled bid-ask spread model that more accurately reflects the true market conditions and the costs associated with different trade sizes.\n\nThe bid-ask spread, which represents the difference between the highest price buyers are willing to pay (bid) and the lowest price sellers are willing to accept (ask), is dynamically adjusted in Ostium’s model. Under this model, the spread scales linearly with position size—meaning that larger trades incur a proportionately larger spread. Therefore, instead of always being quoted the bid or ask, traders are quoted a scaled version of these prices, such as 0.1 times the mid-bid spread or 2 times the mid-ask spread, depending on the specific circumstances of the trade.\n\nWhen a trader opens a long position, a price derived from a scaled ask price is quoted, while a scaled bid price is used when opening a short position. Similarly, when closing a long position, a scaled bid price is quoted, and a scaled ask price is quoted for closing a short position. \n\nThis is represented by the following formula (given K as a constant):\n\nSpreadlong=klong∗PositionSize\nSpreadshort=kshort∗PositionSi\n\nNote that throughout the process of opening a position, Ostium charges a one-time fee to the user, and then compounding fees while a position is open. These will be expanded upon further in the “Fee Structure” section below. \n\nOstium Liquidity Layer\n\nRather than operating under a central limit order book (CLOB) model, Ostium functions as a liquidity pool based DEX, similar to the likes of well-known perp DEXs such as GMX. This model enables the protocol to sustain imbalances in Open Interest, however there are key distinctions to account for between Ostium’s model and traditional perpetuals protocols, wherein LPs benefit directly from trader losses, forming an adversarial relationship between two sets of market participants which are both equally important to the protocol. \n\nOstium’s Shared Liquidity Layer (SLL) is made up of two capital pools - a Liquidity Buffer which serves as the first layer of settlement for positive PnL trades and a Market Making Vault which acts as a backup in the event that the Liquidity Buffer is depleted. Note that capital in the Liquidity Buffer comes from accrued traders’ PnL, while the market making vault is open to deposits from LPs to earn liquidation rewards and 50% of position opening fees. The core idea is that by creating two siloed pools with strategically defined fee structures, LPs benefit primarily from increased trading volume and OI growth. The LB is designed to absorb trader PnL thereby stabilizing LPs’ APY in the event of sustained positive PnL for traders, meaning traders and LPs should simultaneously benefit from protocol growth. \n\nLiquidity Buffer \n\nThe LB is the primary settlement layer for trades on Ostium, meaning that an immediate trading counterparty is not required for trades to be executed. Given that LPs cannot deposit or withdraw from the LB, this ensures that value accrued to LB is reflective of organic trading activity on Ostium. \n\nWhen a position is closed, the LB provides capital to Positive PnL trades while accruing any value from Negative PnL trades. When one side is imbalanced, thereby seeing the OI skew away from 0, the LB absorbs the volatility in trader returns and helps stabilize the APY LPs earn. \n\nConsider the following possible states of delta exposure in the protocol based on market conditions; \n\nPerfect Balance - When traders’ long and short positions are equal, the protocol’s delta exposure is 0, and the market is stable as the positions naturally offset each other.\n\nImbalanced OI - When there is an imbalance in trader positions, i.e more longs than shorts or vice versa, the shared liquidity layer steps in to cover the imbalance and to regain the delta exposure. \n\nExtreme Imbalanced OI - When no traders are taking one side of the market (either all long or all short positions are closed), the liquidity buffer bears all the delta exposure.\n\nIf a series of large trades with positive PnL are closed consecutively, there is potential for the Liquidity Buffer to be drained due to the settlements it must pay out. If this instance occurs, the protocol then turns to the Market Making Vaults (MMVs) for trade settlement. \n\nMarket Making Vaults\n\nOstium’s MMVs are smart contracts structured as liquidity pools, where LPs deposit capital to earn an APY defined by liquidation rewards and 50% of trader opening fees, for the delta exposure risk they take on. This will play a particularly important role in the early stages of the protocol, as it is likely that sustained trader PnL will take a while to accrue to the LB, therefore incentivizing LPs to deposit into the MMV will be crucial for the Ostium Protocol. \n\nUpon depositing capital into the MMV, LPs receive an Ostium Liquidity Provider (OLP) token which functions as a standard receipt-of-deposit. OLP tokens are minted upon deposit and burned upon withdrawal, and LP rewards are distributed on a rebasing model, wherein they are compounded directly to increase the value of the OLP token (if Alice starts with 100 OLP and earns 10% on rewards, she will have 110 OLP upon withdrawal). As a means of incentivizing stickier capital among LPs, Ostium will enable annualized locking boosts favoring long-term lockers with greater rewards. \n\nSupporting Infrastructure\n\nOstium utilizes two critical off-chain infrastructure components, an oracle and an automated keeper system, designed to support operations on the Trading Engine and SLL as efficiently as possible. \n\nRWA oracle \n\nIn order to account for the intricacies of RWAs (i.e out-of-market hours, future contract rolls, price gaps at market open), especially when dealing with various long-tail assets which are less commonly traded and may see lower trading volumes and higher volatility, Ostium Labs developed an in-house oracle service configured to their unique needs. However, operating a fully in-house oracle service imposes significant trust assumptions on a protocol’s users’ behalf, as the outcome of their trades and liquidity provision depends on the functionality of that oracle. To ensure disintermediation and mitigate the associated risks with operating an in-house oracle, the node infrastructure is operated and managed by Stork Network, an open data marketplace comprising a decentralized network of data publishers. Note that this model operates on a pull-based oracle system, meaning that prices are only communicated onchain when explicitly required for trade execution in order to save costs associated with constantly publishing data onchain. \n\nIn short- Ostium’s RWA oracle is custom-built by Ostium Labs, while its nodes are operated and managed by Stork Network. \n\nCrypto Oracle \n\nAside from RWAs, Ostium also offers leveraged trading of BTC and ETH. For these assets, prices are pulled using Chainlink Data Streams, which are purpose-built for providing applications with on-demand access to high-frequency market data. \n\nAutomated Keeper System \n\nIn order to execute and manage conditional trades (i.e. “go long HOG Prices at $80, take profit at $100”), perp DEXs utilize specialized agents called Keepers. It’s common practice for protocols to run the Keepers themselves before gradually decentralizing over time, though it’s never guaranteed they will, in fact, decentralize. The experiences of traders and LPs are still that much more dependent on the underlying protocol under this method. As such, Ostium has outsourced the responsibility of running their Keeper network to the Gelato Network; from day one, Gelato Functions will be used to monitor price requests routed onchain for market orders, as well as existing open trades for conditions necessary to trigger automated orders for RWAs. Automated orders include Limit Orders, Stop Limit Orders, Take Profits, Stop Losses, and Liquidations. \n\nFee Structure\n\nOstium seeks to ensure each source of risk in the protocol is mitigated through a strategic implementation of fees - Open Interest skew, high pool utilization, and high asset volatility. Ostium charges a fixed fee at opening a position and compounding fees for maintaining open positions. Fixed fees are used to pay for associated infrastructure costs, while variable fees are intended to mitigate the various protocol risks mentioned above. \n\nOpening Fee\n\nfeeProtocolOpen=makerCharge+takerCharge+utilizationCharge\n\nWhen opening a position, Ostium charges an opening fee that is a function of five variables to account for external factors affecting a specific trade. Three of these variables are contingent on the trader's asset, leverage, and position size, and the remaining two are contingent on the protocol's OI skew and utilization conditions. Opening fees are sized according to their impact on protocol conditions; trades that increase OI skew (i.e. short position which increases short OI for an asset) create greater delta exposure for the LB and therefore incur a higher baseline fee. Additionally, if a trade pushes OI above a certain threshold during periods of high utilization, a utilization charge is also applied. As a means of encouraging arbitrage on Ostium, which is critical for maintaining stability and balance of prices, a trader is charged a “taker” fee if the amount of leverage exceeds 10x or if OI skew increases with their trade. Conversely, a trader is charged a “maker” fee if the amount of leverage is below 10x and OI skew reduces with this trade. \n\nMaintenance Fees\n\nThroughout the duration of a trade (while a position is open), compounding fees are applied to a) help steer the protocol OI towards equilibrium through funding fees and b) mitigate the directional risk exposure of LPs through volatility fees.\n\nThe funding fee functions like a standard funding rate on perpetual exchanges, in that they are designed to close the gap between long and short OI, thereby bringing the protocol to an equilibrium and minimizing delta risk for LPs in the MMV. However, unlike CEXs where funding rate fees can be claimed, Ostium automatically charges the position value of the “popular” side and injects this value into the PnL of the “unpopular” side, and the returns are realized in a trader’s PnL at position close. Furthermore, this fee is velocity-based, meaning it is an integral of both the length and magnitude of prior imbalances. This design feature is intended to incentivize arbitrageurs to fully close OI imbalances, compensating arbitrage behavior to a greater extent if the negative externality from a prior state was greater. \n\nExpressed as a percentage per day, the formula can be mathematically represented as:\n\nfL​=∫0t​R(Ck(k−1)kC−(L−S)​−k+1)dt\n\nMeanwhile, the Volatility Fee is intended to capture the externality of market volatility for LPs. The fee is automatically charged to a trader's position size and subtracted from position PnL at position closing. Considerably, from an LP perspective, a position that is 10x long on a relatively stable asset such as the Euro poses far less risk than a position that is 10x long on an asset such as Oil, which sees greater intraday swings. It’s important for LPs to be appropriately compensated for the additional volatility risk they may take on. However, it’s also important to ensure that this fee does not discourage traders from trading volatile assets and therefore impact the funding rate. As such, the Volatility Fee was strategically designed to be 10x lower than the Funding Fee. The fee is automatically charged to a trader's position size and subtracted from position PnL at position closing, and can be mathematically represented as: \n\nfr​(v)=F(Vs(s−1)Vs−v​−s+1)\n\nLP Rewards \n\nIt’s worth mentioning that LPs who deposit capital into the MMVs receive a) 50% of opening fees, and b) 100% of liquidation rewards. \n\nTo put it all together, here is what the flow of capital looks like at each stage of a trade on Ostium; \n\nOpening trades: a % of the initial collateral is reserved for the protocol opening fee and evenly (50/50) distributed between Market Making Vault (where LPs deposit) and Protocol Revenue.\n\nHolding trades: volatility fee is accrued from period to period on the open positions and goes directly to the Liquidity Buffer.\n\nClosing trades\n\nIn the event of Positive PnL:\n\nLiquidity Buffer > 0: Liquidity Buffer settles trades;\n\nLiquidity Buffer = 0: LP MM Vault settles trades, if and only if the Liquidity Buffer is depleted (further details here):\n\nIn the event of Negative PnL:\n\nNot Liquidated: Liquidity Buffer receives traders losses;\n\nLiquidated: 90% of initial collateral (traders loss) goes to the Liquidity Buffer and the remaining 10% goes to the LP MM Vault (liquidation reward)\n\nRisks and Considerations \n\nThe primary risk with trading perpetuals on any exchange comes down to liquidation risk. When opening a position, traders deposit collateral; with leverage, they can take on a position size that is substantially larger than the value of their collateral (up to 20x on Ostium). However, the flipside to this is that losses are magnified just as significantly as gains, potentially leading to rapid liquidation if the market suddenly moves against the trader. When a trader's losses equal the initial collateral used to open the position, the position must be liquidated to avoid the protocol from incurring bad debt (a deficit that must be covered). On Ostium, liquidations must occur before collateral value has declined to zero; therefore liquidation takes place when collateral value has fallen to 10% of original collateral deposited. While Ostium has developed a number of built-in mechanisms to mitigate directional risk that affects liquidations, traders opening positions with leverage must still be well-versed in these associated risks and implied losses. \n\nOn the other hand, the greatest risk for LPs depositing into the MMV is directional exposure risk; this occurs when LPs are exposed to sudden price changes in the underlying market, caused by high OI imbalance and high volatility occurring simultaneously. The following matrix illustrates how directional exposure risk changes accordingly: \n\nIn collaboration with Chaos Labs, Ostium developed the Imbalance Score, a metric for assessing the current overall directional exposure risk experienced by the protocol. The Imbalance Score takes into account not just the imbalances in open interest (OI), but also the volatility and correlations between different assets. In short, asset imbalances indicate the extent to which the market is skewed towards long or short positions on certain assets, assets with higher volatility contribute more to the risk score, and positively correlated assets pose greater risks than inversely correlated pairs. According to Ostium, the team plans to continue working with Chaos Labs to actively monitor metrics impacting the protocol's variable directional exposure risk and making parameter recommendations as needed to manage risk accordingly. \n\nIn order to mitigate directional exposure risk to LPs, Ostium employs a) the LB as a settlement layer of first-regard, and b) strategic fee structures to reward LPs for putting their funds at risk in service of protocol liquidity and help drive the protocol towards equilibrium by either closing the OI imbalance or charging higher fees in periods of high volatility. \n\nCompetitive Landscape \n\nPerpetuals trading has been dominated in large part by centralized exchanges (CEXs), which can be explained by a lack of sufficient decentralized exchange infrastructure in the early stages of blockchain and crypto development (Uniswap V1 came out in 2018), as well as a lack of sufficient blockchain infrastructure to enable low fees and high performance. With both high performance Layer 1s (i.e Solana) and rollups (i.e. Arbitrum, Base) hosting increasingly greater amounts of onchain activity, blockchains are proving to be not only resilient, secure, ledgers for storing information, but also high-performance networks that can allow for near-instant settlement and transmission of information and value.\n\nEthereum dominance in perpetuals volume has significantly shrunk, indicating traders’ demand for high trading perps on high-performance chains, with a growing number of new L1s and L2s to meet this demand. \n\nOstium’s Edge  \n\nThere are not many teams today building exchanges to facilitate trade of RWAs as perps onchain. As such, Ostium has an opportunity to gain first-mover advantage here and build a moat around its offering. That said, if Ostium open-sources its code, one could expect a number of forks to launch in addition to various protocols that can be built on top of Ostium. Forks are not a bad thing - sometimes imitation is indeed flattery, and a lot of forks can often be indicative of a good idea and strong core offering. That said, vampire attacks may be a cause for concern -a perps DEX may decide to offer similar markets to Ostium but with greater incentives for traders and LPs through inflationary token emissions (to this point - Ostium doesn’t have a token). However, Uniswap still dominates Sushiswap in most metrics today and Ostium will likely do the same if it moves and launches in a timely manner. \n\nOstium open-sourcing its code also raises some questions here - what can be built on top of an RWA perps exchange? Would these developments benefit Ostium and if so, how? Can Ostium gain enough momentum and adoption initially such that potential competitors would instead be more incentivized to build on top of or integrate Ostium rather than trying to build a competitive product more directly (i.e something similar to the Curve/Convex ecosystem)?\n\nProtocol KPIs & Roadmap\n\nGiven that Ostium is currently in its public testnet stage, protocol data must be taken with a grain of salt as numbers can change with mainnet launch. That said, looking at the testnet leaderboard, the numbers for the latest competition look rather impressive; \n\n15.9k total traders || 88.9k total trades || $13.54b in total volume \n\nLooking ahead, there are several things we’re excited about at Shoal; for starters Ostium just recently completed its first smart contract audit with Zellic and is expected to release details of another audit with Three Sigma in the near future as well; mainnet launch is imminent and apparently 95% complete; it appears than an Ostium mobile app is in the works as well. Additionally, we pose several questions for the Ostium team below, which could serve as guiding frameworks for future research. \n\nQuestions for Ostium \n\nWhy build on Arbitrum / L2 versus an L1 like Solana, which is optimized for speed and performance that perps markets need?\n\nWhy build on Arbitrum in particular?\n\nHow do you imagine the MEV landscape within commodities markets? How might this differ from crypto markets (if at all)? \n\nWith its open source code, does Ostium envision any products or services that can be built on top of the exchange? \n\nClosing Thoughts \nThe Case for Bringing Capital Markets Onchain \n\nTo reference Larry Fink’s grand vision of tokenization once more; imagine a globally accessible distributed ledger with hardcoded immutable evidence of who is buying, who is selling, who owns how many assets at any given time, with near-instantaneous settlement on top of everything. This scenario describes quite an egalitarian financial services industry, but it also speaks to what blockchains were ultimately built for - enabling transparency, immutability, and significantly faster settlement speeds relative to that of existing services and markets.\n\nMeanwhile, Grayscale’s Zach Pandl argues that many types of assets, such as equities, are served relatively well by their current digital infrastructure, and that it is less than obvious that public blockchains will be superior solutions. Instead, he makes the case that the potential key benefit from tokenization is greater network effects. By implementing a common platform to host all assets across the globe, we can create a financial system with greater functionality, access, and lower costs than today’s existing solutions. \n\nThe Case for Ostium: Perps > Tokenization \n\nOstium believes that perps will ultimately frontrun tokenized RWAs as the primary means of onboarding non-crypto assets to be traded onchain. Perps are as popular and successful as they are in crypto largely because they “allow simple directional bets & abstract away the complexity of expiring futures and options.” Where tokenization suffers from operational management and regulatory hurdles, perps offer significant efficiency and go-to-market advantages. All that’s really needed to set up a perps market onchain is sufficient liquidity and a robust supporting data feed. This becomes especially easier for protocols whose pricing feed infrastructure is deeply integrated with existing tradfi data service providers. Unlike tokenization and its associated complexities (i.e. composable KYC-enforced token standards), perpetual contracts do not require the underlying asset to live onchain - traders are only trading derivatives contracts here. To set up a liquid perps market onchain, there’s no need for the underlying spot market to be onchain or integrated into crypto directly. \n\nThis isn’t to say tokenized markets won’t exist - everything will eventually settle onchain one day. Capital markets will likely gravitate towards blockchain networks for enforcement and verifiability, which would occur in two ways as eloquently described in An Unreal Primer; first by acknowledging RWA tokens as bearer assets in different jurisdictions, thereby enforcing owners’ legal protections and, second, by integrating collateral and other forms of lender protection directly into smart contracts to offer stronger assurances than that of existing legal systems.  \n\nThe reality, however, is that it will indeed take a long time for every liquid public market to be issued and settled on a blockchain, as it will take a long time for the blockchain to become the ultimate ledger of record and source of truth for financial institutions. Until then, perpetuals ultimately provide the better choice for traders as they provide more flexibility, leverage, and fractionalization than spot markets. Looking ahead, Ostium is betting that perps become the default listing engine for RWAs and can support markets liquid and deep enough to incentivize participation from traders of all backgrounds and appetites. \n\nOne might argue that potential hindrance to the broader adoption of perps among retail investors is the perceived complexity of these financial instruments. As opposed to spot markets, perpetuals require accounting for a number of additional factors such as the relationship between collateral and leverage, how the funding rate works and how it affects PnL, the difference between underlying asset price and the price of the perpetual contract. That said, Robinhood made options fun and accessible to retail, which generated $154 million in revenue for them in Q1 2024 alone, and options are arguably more complex than perpetuals. Perpetuals have also been the single most successful product to be developed around crypto assets. So perhaps all we’re missing for trading virtually any asset onchain is a user-friendly perp DEX after all.\n\nWhere else can one bet on the price of hogs, soybeans, oil, forex, and more in one platform onchain? \n\nReferences\n\nArtemis Research.

Representation refers to various factors dealing with the economic aspects of an asset (value, expiration, physical condition), while ownership refers to the legitimacy of an asset’s title in a ledger. The bottom line here is that assets are valuable economic resources, but secure ownership of these assets is just as valuable, if not more, than the underlying asset itself. After all, if anyone can claim they own someone else’s asset and proper measures to refute this claim are not in place, just how valuable is this asset in the first place? \n\nImportant Considerations for Tokenization \n\nAnother important consideration to make on the topic of tokenization are token standards. Token standards are key to enabling composability in DeFi - there are no better examples for this than the success of the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem built around ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens. The recently implemented ERC-4626 Tokenized Vault Standard enables yield-bearing assets which represent one’s share in an investment, like a liquidity pool, and accrue value directly. An issue arises when cross-chain transactions come into the picture: blockchains are siloed environments by nature which lack native mechanisms to interact with data outside its environment, even data from other blockchains. While protocols like the Cosmos IBC solve this problem for blockchains building on the Cosmos stack, they do not account for cross-domain transfers such as Cosmos <> Solana, Ethereum <> Solana. The good news is that a number of interoperability solutions are being created that ultimately solve this problem by using ‘alternative mechanisms’, such as lock-and-mint, mint-and-burn, as well as liquidity pool and intents-based protocols. However, this only solves for crypto-native assets and does not account for RWAs to be brought onchain. The point here is that a lack of a universal token standard creates a lack of composability and we can’t exactly “tokenize everything” without robust token standards in place first. \n\nCurrently with ERC-4626, the process for real-world assets requires the submission of orders and a corresponding waiting period for fulfillment to account for the coordination of investments, redemptions, asset originations, and asset repayments. Users deposit tokens into a pool and receive tokens representing their share until the request is completed later. This doesn’t reflect the near-instantaneous settlement and performance benefits blockchains can provide to existing infrastructure, which is one of the key pillars of the case for tokenization. Proposals like EIP-7540, which would be an extension of ERC-4626 with asynchronous deposit and redemption support, are one potential way to approach this issue. \n\nHowever, for financial institutions, the ability to create and enforce a KYC (know-your-customer) standard is absolutely critical from a compliance perspective. Centrifuge, who has built a platform for tokenizing RWAs that is live and running since October 2020, describes what a token standard to link KYC information to a wallet can enable. Through this process, anyone can: verify onchain whether a wallet belongs to an individual or an entity, determine information about the person/entity, and can track who has approved this KYC information. With a KYC token standard, new possibilities are unlocked for composability and user experience; Centrifuge investments could be traded on secondary markets without the user needing to perform an additional KYC check. Looking more broadly: users could complete KYC once and interact with any permissioned protocol without additional onboarding steps. While this may sound like a nightmare for crypto-natives, consider that institutional adoption of blockchain and digital assets will not happen without mechanisms like this in place for legal and compliance reasons. Furthermore, a KYC-token standard will never become the de-facto standard for crypto assets at any point, even if it becomes widely adopted by financial institutions. We do strongly believe we will still be able to trade our magic internet coins anonymously if we wish to do so. \n\nBelow we raise some questions regarding tokenization inspired by Alex Weseley of Artemis Research and some of our personal theses for which teams and protocols are well-poised to benefit from tokenization; \n\nHow do different smart contract languages and infrastructure affect the implementation of tokenization?\n\nMove, a language optimized for security, features stronger security features regarding asset ownership than Solidity and is custom-built for blockchains as opposed to Rust which is a general-purpose language. However, given the Move ecosystem is still nascent, necessary infrastructure and tooling for interoperability between Move <> other VMs such as EVM or SVM arise. For this reason,webelieve Movement Labs is currently the best poised to fill this need. \n\nHow will privacy compute solutions (ZKPs, FHE, TEEs) factor into the equation for financial institutions, for whom privacy and security quite frankly matter much more than the average onchain degen or retail investor? \n\nWhat role will the nuances of different blockchain designs play? Will there be a winner-take-all outcome or will different blockchain designs serve different purposes and clients better? Furthermore - how will financial institutions approach developing their own public blockchain? What are the incentives to build an app-chain, L2, etc ? \n\nWith this in mind, interoperability solutions are set up to play a paramount role in facilitating an interconnected system (SWIFT enables banks to communicate globally). So who are the key players poised to benefit from this? Personally,webelieve this would be Chainlink CCIP, LayerZero, and Avalanche Teleporter, in large part due to their ongoing integrations with financial institutions and partners. \n\nIntents-based bridge models like Across and Debridge cannot be discounted either here; the UX is significantly better and adoption of these protocols continues to grow slowly but steadily. If these protocols were to build solutions tailored for institutions we presumeinstitutionswepresume there would be a good deal of interest given their low costs and fast bridging speeds.\n\nZooming out further, we’d also like to add some interesting questions raised in “Electronification, Trading, and Crypto” with regards to the broader technological transformation implied by tokenization; \n\nWhat does settlement look like in a world where it can be fine-tuned, so it no longer has to conform to market conventions around specific times or intervals? Is it possible to build primitives that let you choose settlement time, and what implications would such designs have on market functioning? \n\nHow might blockchains enable a move from price-time priority markets to markets based on fees and competition, and what might that mean for market structure and consumers?\n\nHow Perpetuals Work\n\nTo function, perpetuals need three key components - a market for matching buyers and sellers, a funding rate, and a spot index price. \n\nA functional market to facilitate the matching of buyers and sellers is essential for the exchange of any asset, from commercial real estate to memecoins to perpetual contracts. This market must be liquid and efficient to ensure that trades can be executed promptly and at fair prices, which is often facilitated by the use of market makers who are responsible for buying and selling assets in a structured manner for the purpose of injecting liquidity and trading volume into markets. Lastly, a robust trading platform and interface is necessary for trading to take place on. It’s crucial that the interface be as intuitive and easy to navigate as possible for market participants to open and close positions with minimal friction. \n\nThe spot index price refers to an aggregated, real-time price that reflects the current market value of an asset, ensuring that the perpetual contract's price remains aligned with the actual market conditions. This provides a stable reference point for perpetual traders to rely on, by smoothing out any short-term anomalies or price discrepancies that might occur due to liquidity issues or disrupted price feeds. \n\nThe Funding Rate facilitates price discovery for perpetual contracts. Futures contracts have predefined expiry dates and though they can and often do trade at a discount or a premium to their underlying asset, contracts are settled using the underlying spot price of the asset, thereby converging this margin to zero as the contract approaches its expiry. \n\nConversely, perpetuals lack an expiry and therefore require an ongoing payment mechanism (settled every 8 hours) in which the counterparties pay one another depending on market conditions at a given time, known as the funding rate. When the funding rate is positive, that is, when the price of the perpetual swap is higher than the index, longs pay shorts. When the funding rate is negative, wherein the price of the perpetual swap is lower than the index price, shorts pay longs. Ultimately, settlement is based on the difference between the perpetual swap price and that of the underlying asset, as well as the difference in leverage between the two sides if leverage is used. This mechanism is designed to balance market demand by ultimately encouraging the price of the perpetual to shift back towards the index price. \n\nSimilar to options and other derivatives contracts, perpetuals allow investors to speculate on the future price movement of an asset without having to own the underlying asset itself. This allows for anyone to open a position in a perpetual contract with leverage, meaning they can access and trade a larger amount of capital than the collateral (margin) to be posted on their account. For a short summary on leverage ratios: Leverage 2:1 = 50% collateral to be posted, Leverage 5:1 = 20% collateral to be posted, Leverage 10:1 = 10% collateral to be posted, and so on. This unlocks capital efficiency thereby allowing for a greater number of potential market participants, as one can now trade $1000 worth of BTC with just a few hundred dollars. Of course, it's important to note that leverage is two-fold and just as traders can access more capital with less upfront costs, the risks associated with doing so can often reverberate much stronger than buying and holding in spot markets. \n\nNot financial or tax advice.

However, their user adoption has grown at a notably slow rate, especially relative to Web2 apps and services. When considering Netflix’s success, they overtook Blockbuster by capitalizing on the superior convenience and choice through the shift from physical DVD rentals to the world of digital services and streaming. The convenience of having the world at one’s fingertips with smartphones led to the adoption of mobile apps, which transformed the way people would interact with the internet much to the benefit of social networks. ChatGPT, which surpassed Instagram and Tiktok as the fastest growing app, introduced a simple and powerful way for almost anyone to harness AI with a simplified chatbot UX utilizing natural language processing (NLP). \n\nThe recurring theme among these breakout products and services and their success is that they provided a better user experience relative to any incumbents or competitors they went up against. In order for decentralized applications to achieve similar success, the onchain user experience must be as seamless and convenient as possible, far from the world of seed phrases and fragmented chains that is common today.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nSubscribe\nTransforming the Onchain User Experience \n\nThe end-game for the onchain user experience requires no knowledge of any underlying blockchain infrastructure on the user’s behalf; where anyone can do anything on any blockchain without needing to go through arduous onboarding and bridging processes. To better understand the significance of this design, however, it helps to consider the state of accounts today: an onchain account is ultimately the bridge between a user and the blockchain, storing balances onchain and defining all activities and interactions with any blockchain-native program. Throughout their history, most blockchains have utilized the externally owned account (EOA) model, which functions as a subset of two parts:  a public key serving as an identity and reference point for receiving assets (wallet address) and a private key serving as a master password for access (seed phrase). Wallets technically function as account abstraction services, in that they simplify the management of one or more onchain accounts. \n\nThough EOAs are known for their simplicity and granting the power of self-custody to anyone, they have also significantly hindered the onchain user experience thus far. The most common drawbacks to EOAs are that anyone who gains access to the seed phrase can access the wallet (this threat arises for those storing seed phrases on a cloud-based service like iCloud) and that anyone who loses access to their seed phrase and/or forgets it can no longer access their funds onchain. \n\nKey to enabling such an onchain user experience is the emergence of abstraction primitives, which are the many products and services built around abstracting away as many friction-inducing pain points in the onchain user experience as possible. These may come as toolkits and frameworks for developers to implement into their own network or apps, or direct user-facing products and services. As development in this area heats up and the number of teams launching their own abstraction primitives starts to grow, achieving a seamless onchain user experience may come sooner than most people think, as Vitalik suggests. But what exactly will enable this breakthrough? \n\nAccount abstraction refers to the separation of management of an onchain account from the end-user. The concept was initially floated around as early as 2017, but mostly struggled to gain any traction before ERC-4337 was proposed in 2021. The initial culmination of efforts around account abstraction led to the development of the smart contract-wallet, commonly referred to as a smart account. In this model, an onchain account is managed by a smart contract, and can therefore be more programmable and optimized for user needs. This unlocks new possibilities, such as being able to sign up for an account using familiar social logins, paying for gas fees with the same asset across different chains, being able to perform multiple cross-chain transactions in one click, and more. \n\nKey to enabling account abstraction is the development of execution abstraction services, where the execution of an onchain transaction is outsourced to specialized service providers called solvers (also referred to as fillers or executors) for the best possible performance and delivery on the signer’s behalf. Here, users sign off-chain messages called intents containing instructions for performing onchain actions, i.e. transaction fulfillment requests. By separating the execution of a transaction from its signature, users can express desired outcomes more easily, and back-end solutions such as private mempools or competitive solver networks help deliver the best possible settlement and value for the user. \n\nThe Endgame: Chain Abstraction\n\nAnother critical component for enabling the ultimate onchain user experience is the ability to communicate and interact across different blockchain environments. Historically, users have relied on bridges for filling this need, which have proven over time to be a great source of risk and insecurity. Chain abstraction iterates on the developments around account and execution abstraction while introducing new infrastructure at the network layer, thereby removing the complexities of communicating and interacting across different blockchain environments. See Shoal’s chain abstraction deep dive for a comprehensive overview of the concept’s fundamentals and the broader chain abstraction landscape.  \n\nChain abstraction is the culmination of efforts around one common goal: to provide a seamless user experience in which the user can perform onchain actions without being required to know which blockchain they are using at a given time. This report explores how Particle Network is approaching the development of the ultimate onchain user experience through its new chain abstraction stack. \n\nCase Study with Particle Network \n\nProtocol Background \n\nLed by co-founders Pengyu Wang and Tao Pan, Particle debuted in 2022 as a Wallet Abstraction service provider, launching a stack for developers to create non-custodial, dApp-embedded wallets that could leverage social logins via MPC-TSS technology. With the onset of ERC-4337 account abstraction the protocol shifted to include an AA stack into their existing WA stack, utilizing smart contract wallets for enhanced account structures. This set up the launch of BTC Connect, which brought AA services to the BTC ecosystem via native Bitcoin signatures. Now, Particle is launching their Layer 1 blockchain as part of their comprehensive, multi-faceted chain abstraction stack. \n\nParticle Network is being developed by a globally distributed team of 30+ full-time employees, and has established partnerships with the likes of Berachain, Avalanche, Arbitrum, zkSync and more. The protocol has raised officially $25 Million over the course of several seed rounds led by Spartan Group and Gumi Crypto, and recently secured an investment from Binance Labs as well. \n\nProtocol Overview\n\nParticle Network is a modular Layer 1 built on the Cosmos SDK, which will function as a coordination and settlement layer for cross-chain transactions within a high-performance EVM-compatible execution environment. \n\nThe Particle L1 is one component of Particle’s broader chain abstraction stack, which consists of Universal Accounts providing a simple interface for unifying token balances across different chains, Universal Liquidity enabling UAs on the backend, and Universal Gas allowing users to pay gas fees in any token they hold. \n\nThe end-goal for Particle Network is to unify users across all chains at the account-level, facilitating seamless cross-chain interactions with a single balance and account on any L1,L2, or L3, and allowing anyone to easily pay gas fees in any token they wish. Let’s take a closer look at the various key components working to help meet that goal. \n\nUniversal Accounts \n\nUniversal Accounts refer to the new account structure that will be powered by the Particle L1, and are key to Particle’s chain abstraction stack. At their core, UAs are ERC-4337 smart accounts attached to a pre-existing EOA (externally owned address), unifying token balances across multiple chains by automatically routing and executing atomic cross-chain transactions. For the end-user, UAs provide a single interface for managing funds and transacting across various dApps, abstracting away the friction-inducing pain points involved in setting up and funding a new account on a new chain, which often requires purchasing the gas token of that native chain as well. \n\nThis interface is built on top of existing wallets and leverages Particle’s liquidity layer-Universal Liquidity- to execute atomic cross-chain transactions and route funds from a user’s balance across different chains as needed. Transactions are processed by Particle’s globally distributed network of nodes, which manage the associated bundling, relaying, and verification tasks. \n\nTo better illustrate, consider the steps involved in fulfilling a user’s simple request to purchase Dogcoin on an external chain (chain X):\n\nUser connects to their UA through an existing wallet or social login.\n\nUser submits their transaction request to the Particle L1, expressed as an ERC-4337 UserOp to purchase Dogcoin on chain X.\n\nBundler nodes within Particle’s decentralized node network handle the associated UserOp and executes it accordingly.\n\nParticle’s Relayer Nodes then monitor and synchronize the execution status on the associated chains. Once the transaction has been confirmed to be executed, the status is routed back from the chain to the Relayer Nodes, who communicate the status back to the UA and end-user. \n\nOur user now has the token they wished to purchase in their UA balance, without ever interacting with the chain that token lives on. \n\nEvidently, there are more in-house components at work here that warrant further inspection. Think of UAs as Particle’s user-facing product. Key to enabling the seamless experience they provide are the Universal Liquidity and Universal Gas features.\n\nUniversal Liquidity  \n\nUniversal Liquidity refers to the layer of the Particle Network responsible for the automatic execution of transactions submitted via UAs. This feature is powered by Particle’s distributed network of Bundler nodes, specialized services initiating the necessary steps for the execution of a UserOp, such as swapping or pulling liquidity from pools. In addition, a distributed network of Relayer nodes, referred to as the Decentralized Messaging Network (DMN), is responsible for monitoring transaction status on external chains (i.e. destination chains) and communicating their settlement status back to the Particle L1.\n\nThe key purpose of Universal Liquidity is to enable users to interact with different chains via cross-chain transactions without needing to purchase and hold any tokens on the associated chains. To better understand, consider the following flow for a user wishing to purchase 100 USDC of Dogcoin on Chain D while they hold 25 USDC on chains A, B, C, and D each.  \n\nUser signs UserOp to purchase 100 USDC of Dogcoin on Chain D, effectively bundling their balances across four chains (Chain A, B, C, D) into a single signature processed by the Particle L1. \n\nUpon executing the signature, the USDC the user holds on Chains A, B, and C is sent to a Liquidity Provider (otherwise understood as a filler). \n\nThe LP releases the full USDC amount on Chain D. \n\nThe USDC on Chain D is swapped for Dogcoin using a local DEX.\n\nThe resulting Dogcoin balance is now reflected in the user’s UA. \n\nUniversal Gas  \n\nUniversal Gas is the third pillar of Particle’s chain abstraction stack, key to enabling gas abstraction, wherein the friction-inducing pain point of acquiring and holding multiple gas tokens is abstracted away from the end-user, who can now pay gas fees in any token on any chain. Alice can pay for gas on a swap on Solana using her USDC on Base, while Bob pays gas for purchasing an NFT on Ethereum using his OP token on Optimism. \n\nWhen a user wishes to execute a transaction through a Particle UA, an interface will prompt the user to select their gas token of choice, which is then automatically routed through Particle’s native Paymaster contract. All gas payments are settled to their respective source and destination chains, while a portion of the fee is swapped into Particle’s native $PARTI token to be settled on the Particle L1. \n\nProtocol Architecture & Design \n\nThe Particle L1 utilizes a high-performance EVM-compatible execution environment and a dual-token staking model for security, consisting of BTC and the native PARTI token. Consensus and data availability are outsourced to a distributed network of nodes referred to as Modular Nodes. Particle employs an aggregated data availability model (AggDA) which plugs into a combination of providers including Celestia, Avail, and Near DA, and is powered by a decentralized system of Aggregated DA node operators. \n\nOn the backend, Particle’s chain abstraction stack is powered by three key modules: the Master Keystore Hub, Decentralized Messaging Network (DMN), and Decentralized Bundler. The Master Keystore Hub serves as the central source of truth across the Particle L1, coordinating smart contract deployments across all chains, synchronizing settings between each UA instance, and maintaining synchronized state across all chains. The DMN is responsible for communicating transaction execution status across different chains that a user is transacting on, and then communicating the status for the userOp to be settled on the Particle L1. This feature is powered by a network of Relayer Nodes. Lastly, Particle utilizes a decentralized bundler network, wherein a network of bundler node operators are responsible for initiating and executing incoming userOps. The network is built around a distributed, permissionless network of Modular Nodes, among which tasks are delegated and outsourced. \n\nModular Nodes \n\nThe use of Modular Nodes will allow for anyone to participate in running nodes specialized for facilitating critical operations on the L1. These nodes can be categorized by their respective function: bundler nodes are responsible for the execution of cross-chain UserOps, relayer nodes are responsible for monitoring and communicating the status of transactions (i.e. executed, failed) back to the Particle L1 to be settled, watchtower nodes are responsible for monitoring the status of nodes and their respective tasks in the bundler and relayer networks, as well as providing execution and fraud proofs for each block per epoch. \n\nAggregated Data Availability Model \n\nIn the context of blockchains, data availability (DA) refers to the ability to verify data that has been published to a blockchain. Typically, blockchains will employ a single solution for DA, which can be in-house under an integrated architecture, or conversely outsourced to partners or third-party providers under a modular architecture. Particle is constructing its DA model to mitigate single points of failure across its architecture by adopting an aggregated model, outsourcing DA to Celestia, Avail, and Near DA collectively. Particle utilizes two different approaches to DA: selective publishing which allocates each block to a separate DA provider, and redundant publishing in which each individual block is sent across each DA provider. \n\nIt will be interesting to see if Particle expands to other DA providers (i.e. EigenDA) in the future as the sector expands. \n\nDual Staking \n\nBlockchains which use a Proof-of-Stake model assign validators to propose and validate new blocks based on the number of native tokens they have staked to the network, rewarding them proportionally to the number of blocks they vote on. One key risk with these networks in early stages is the risk of price volatility in the native token impacting network security and stability. Particle aims to mitigate this risk through a dual staking model which will utilize BTC via the Babylon staking protocol and the native PARTI token, with validator pools assigned for each respective token. \n\nOnboarding Process with Universal SDK \n\nParticle’s Universal SDK lets application developers create a seamless onboarding process to UAs, by enabling users to attach their existing wallets through the implementation of an EIP-1193 provider. This allows for users to be able to immediately be able to transact from their UAs upon signing in. \n\nThe onboarding process within an application leveraging Particle Network’s Universal SDK is visualized below.\n\nState of Particle Network \n\nPrior to the development of the Particle L1, Particle saw over 17m wallet activations, 10m UserOps, and over 900 integrations with various decentralized applications, according to the team. \n\nOn May 2, 2024, Particle Network’s incentivized L1 testnet launched, offering point rewards through the Particle Pioneer platform. Particle Network’s incentivized public testnet allows users to test out its flagship Universal Accounts and Universal Gas features to earn points for allocation of the upcoming $PARTI token. \n\nAccording to the Particle Testnet V2 explorer, there have been over 7.3m total transactions across 1.3m blocks, averaging above 400k daily transactions regularly. As per the Particle Pioneer campaign website, the testnet has seen over 182m transactions, and there are currently over 1.49m users earning 27.3B points in total, at an average of 18.3k points per user. The Particle L1 is currently slated to launch on mainnet sometime in H2 2024. \n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\nChain abstraction is poised to become the next major framework for interoperability platforms to build around, and there are a number of developments on the horizon which will compete with Particle to become the standard toolkit or stack for building chain abstraction services on. \n\nNear Network \n\nNear is a sharded Proof-of-Stake Layer 1 blockchain that provides a full-stack application domain for developers building decentralized products and services. Near is building out its chain abstraction stack this Account Aggregation - a multi-faceted structure funneling users’ cross-chain interactions to be run through a single account. \n\nAccounts on Near use two types of keys: Full-Access Keys, which function as private keys (i.e. can sign any transaction and should be kept private), and Function-Call Keys, which are granted permissions to sign calls exclusively to a specific contract or set of contracts. Near also utilizes its FastAuth login service to allow users to sign up for an account with an email and use biometrics instead of passwords.\n\nKey to enabling this structure are multi-chain signatures, which allow any Near account to interact with addresses on other chains. This is achieved through the NEAR MPC network, which enables key resharing and maintains the same public key even as nodes and key shares change. MPC signer nodes within the Near network allow smart contracts to initiate the signing process, creating numerous remote addresses on any chain. Near also introduced meta transactions through NEP-366, enabling users to transact across multiple chains without holding the native gas token. This is facilitated by Relayers, third-party providers that attach the necessary tokens for gas fees to the signed transactions they relay to the network. \n\nPolygon AggLayer \n\nPolygon is developing AggLayer, a unified bridge for L2s built using the Polygon CDK which will aggregate zk-proofs and uniformly submit them to Ethereum for settlement. In this model, all chains share a bridge contract with other supported AggLayer chains, thereby maintaining sovereignty while benefiting from a global liquidity hub that makes it easier to bootstrap early networks. \n\nThe AggLayer will use ZK proofs to create an aggregated environment that “feels like a single chain” while allowing for supported chains to maintain their sovereignty. Application developers could potentially benefit from being able to reach more users, as users from different chains will be able to interact with their product or service as well. For the end-user, the goal is the same as in chain abstraction: to provide a UX that resembles the Internet – a single environment that doesn’t require cumbersome and frequent bridging and other complex processes. Thus far, the live components of the AggLayer that Polygon zkEVM has connected to are 1) a unified bridge to Ethereum for enabling cross-chain transactions, and 2) A bridgeAndCall() library of solidity contracts to help craft these transactions. \n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nEverclear - Formerly Connext, Everclear is developing a new chain abstraction stack.  As the name suggests, Everclear is launching “the first clearing layer” to provide global settlement of cross-chain transactions. Everclear will function as an Arbitrum Orbit L2, powered by Gelato RaaS, and will use Hyperlane and Eigenlayer to connect to other chains. The protocol ultimately acts as a shared computer for coordinate cross-chain transactions, with settlements represented as invoices and cleared via a dutch auction. This will revolve around the use of Clearing Layers, “a decentralized network that coordinates global netting and settlement of capital flows between chains''. Everclear aims to cut costs for market participants, is programmable and can be plugged into any settlement rail for any tx, and enable permissionless liquidity for new chains and assets from day one. \n\nSocket - Socket 2.0 marks a shift for the Socket protocol from cross-chain to chain abstraction services, highlighted by its flagship Modular Order Flow Auction (MOFA) mechanism, which aims to enable a competitive mechanism for efficient chain abstracted markets. Traditional OFAs involve a network of various actors performing specialized tasks that compete to deliver the best possible outcome for an end-user request. Similarly, MOFA is designed to provide an open marketplace for execution agents, called Transmitters, and user intents. Within the MOFA, Transmitters compete to create and fulfill chain abstracted bundles, or ordered sequences of user-requests which require transfer of data and value across multiple blockchains.  \n\nFuture Outlook \n\nThe chain abstraction opportunity is an exciting one. However, there are some important considerations to make as more teams set out to launch their own solutions, VCs start allocating more capital into anything that mentions ‘chain abstraction’, and users start scratching their heads around which solution is best. \n\nThe Case for Abstraction Primitives\n\nZee Prime Capital pointed out several important considerations with regards to the abstraction primitives landscape in a recent post.\n\n“Without a product, chain abstraction is not a real solution to the real problem”. \n\nIt’s certainly true that while user experience remains a critical hurdle for the crypto industry to overcome, it is likely not the ultimate bottleneck in bringing more users onchain. Indeed, developments in infrastructure grew as a response to poor UX imposed by high fees and slow settlement. Now that the infrastructure is here (over 200 L1s/L2s), there is an overall lack of successful products and services being built on top of this infrastructure.  This aligns with a perspective Mert shared recently, who claimed not enough people are considering that barriers to building strong crypto apps are not crypto-native (i.e. infrastructure, UX) but instead revolve around regulatory unclarity and misaligned incentive structures across the broader industry.\n\nOne example is the adoption (or lack thereof) of smart wallets.\n\ntweet\n\nDespite the innovations they bring, smart wallets have largely failed to gain meaningful adoption thus far. Incumbents like Phantom set record number of downloads with the onset of the memecoin mania back in Q4 2023/Q1 2024, demonstrating people are willing to deal with seed phrases and clunky UIs for now, as long as they can get their hands on the latest dog token. \n\nTo push back, developing successful products and services with new technology takes time. It took years of trial and error for the first class of successful web-based application to emerge. As the demand for blockspace on base layers grows, it’s likely there will be more rollups and app-specific chains coming over the years. With the onset of RaaS providers and modular infrastructure solutions like Celestia, it’s only going to become easier to launch new chains and environments, and these environments will need to be able to seamlessly communicate with one another. The need to abstract chains away from the end-user comes from building a popular app that will entice users from other chains to want to use it, prompting the need for services for enabling a seamless experience to do so. Chain abstraction intends to solve the fundamental issue of a lack of seamless cross-chain functionality, something which a current lack of available products and services does not invalidate. \n\nWith this in mind, one critical challenge abstraction primitives will have to contend with is ensuring the successful coordination across solver/node networks regarding state attestation, solver execution, transaction status, block confirmation, and other cross-chain guarantees, all of which require consensus. The nature of capital markets sees that another faster, cheaper solution will always be on the horizon, meaning chain abstraction service providers must account for a number of complex backend processes and their implications, where things like timing games and order flow capture start to play a bigger role over time.. \n\nImportant Considerations for Particle Network\n\nA key question that arises with Particle’s network of distributed nodes is just how decentralized this network will be. Will there only be a select few entities participating in operating nodes, or will Particle be able to gain enough traction to maintain a sufficiently-decentralized node network? And how can Particle successfully incentivize enough node operators to become sufficiently decentralized in the first place? \n\nFor this, we suggest two things:\n\n1) Minimizing barriers to entry and participation as a node operator\n\n2) Providing a public dashboard for monitoring and observing the decentralization of the node network via the Particle explorer. \n\nParticle is building a settlement and coordination layer for atomic cross-chain transactions, where Universal Accounts replace the need to use multiple wallets, purchase multiple gas tokens, and bridging tokens to use dApps on other ecosystems. This brings up the question of value accrual; what economic impact will the successful adoption of Universal Accounts and the Particle L1 have on other blockchains and ecosystems? Will they benefit from a greater number of users accessing their applications? \n\nThe Case for Chain Abstraction and Particle Network \n\nThe need to transform the state of the user experience on blockchain-native applications is not a new idea, and developers have worked on this problem for some time now. Chain abstraction stands to benefit the end-user by creating easier-to-navigate onchain experiences, the application developer by unlocking new user bases for their apps, and the L1/L2/L3 by allowing for cheaper and more efficient cross-chain communication and routing.\n\nParticle is building account-level chain abstraction to aid in this endeavor. By unifying cross-chain interactions into a single interface with Universal Accounts, allowing users to transact on any chain with Universal Liquidity and to pay for gas in any token with Universal Gas, the Particle Network L1 is well-poised to be a leader in moving the future of chain abstraction forward.  \n\nVitalik claims there is “lots of energy and will” to make the seamless onchain user experience a reality. Improved user experience alone won’t bring millions of users onchain, but it is one of the most important steps to take in order to do so. \n\nReferences \n\nMasmoudi, M. (2022, February 14).

Further regulation and safeguards like ‘kill switches’ are essential to prevent misuse and build trust.\n\nFuture Prospects: The continuous evolution of AI agents will likely expand into audio-to-video domains and broader consumer applications, driving mainstream adoption and innovation.\n\nAI Agents: The “Ace in the Hole” for Web3’s Gaming & Entertainment Verticals\nThe Rapid Evolution of Gaming and Entertainment\n\nThe gaming industry is experiencing a transformative moment with the rise of user-generated content (UGC). Major titles, like Roblox and crypto-native metaverses such as The Sandbox, are enabling users to create and personalize their gaming experiences. This shift towards UGC is further enhanced by the advent of AI virtual assistants and companions, which not only help personalize games but also become another form of UGC themselves. Users will soon begin fine-tuning their own companions, potentially making them available for others to interact with, similar to how user-trained variations of chatbots like jobGPT and TutorGPT have emerged.\n\nGoogle DeepMind's achievements in AI, particularly with its recently-advanced chess engine, highlight the potential of AI agents within gaming. This engine surpasses the previous AlphaZero record by employing multiple AI agents with different play styles, forming a grandmaster capable of mastering every variation of play. This \"searchless\" chess engine understands positions through evaluation, selecting the best-suited agents for each chess opening, mimicking human’s diversity of thought and creativity.\n\nMany established blockchain-native AI protocols have focused on decentralized computing and governance frameworks, laying the groundwork for responsible AI development. With these foundations in place, developers are now turning their attention towards more complex AI models, such as AI agents, which can perform autonomous tasks with minimal human intervention.\n\nBlockchain technology has further fueled this evolution by providing a decentralized infrastructure that ensures transparency, security, and immutability of transactions. Integrating AI agents into these standardized environments can create more collaborative and personalized experiences for users, transforming the gaming and entertainment industries in ways that may still be difficult to imagine. \n\nWhat are AI Agents?\n\nAt its core, an AI agent is software programmed to independently interact with its environment, gather data from its interactions, and utilize the data to meet its predetermined objectives. Objectives can range from task automation to more complex decision-making processes. Key to AI agents is their autonomous nature, wherein human intervention is intended to be as minimal as possible in the execution of a given objective. These programs autonomously perform tasks with both \"read\" and \"write\" access. Unlike popular AI applications today, such as ChatGPT, which can only gather information in response to questions (read access), AI agents can also take actions based on the gathered information (write access).\n\nThe origins of autonomous agents can be traced back to broader efforts throughout the 1980s and 90s to design machines which could learn from their environment and make informed decisions without manual human intervention. The development of various machine learning, deep learning, and neural network algorithms would then set the stage for the rise of more advanced forms of agents seen today, such as Google DeepMind's new chess engine, which uses multiple AI agents to master various play styles. \n\nAdvancements in AI Methodology\n\nReinforcement learning has been instrumental in developing AI agents that can autonomously navigate complex environments and achieve specific goals. Neural networks, particularly deep learning models, allow AI agents to process large amounts of data and recognize patterns, expanding their potential applications in various domains, including gaming and entertainment.\n\nOne of the significant breakthroughs in AI methodology that has empowered AI agents is the development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that work together to create realistic data. The generator creates data, and the discriminator evaluates it against real-world data, providing feedback to improve the generator’s output. This iterative process has enabled the creation of highly realistic virtual characters, environments, and even art, making GANs particularly valuable in gaming and entertainment.\n\nAnother important advancement is transfer learning, where pre-trained AI models on large datasets are fine-tuned for specific tasks. This approach has dramatically reduced the time and resources needed to develop sophisticated AI agents. Transfer learning allows AI agents to leverage existing knowledge and adapt it to new environments and tasks, making them more versatile and efficient.\n\nAI Agents at Work\n\nIn a multi-agent system, which involves multiple agents collaborating towards a shared goal, AI agents are expected to delegate tasks to other AI agents in order to facilitate a collaborative and efficient workflow. This process involves a generalized AI assistant being given a task, researching the required steps, and assigning specialized AI agents to each step. These agents then work as a team to complete the task, with additional agents involved for quality control and oversight, minimizing the need for human intervention.\n\nIn the context of gaming, AI agents can enhance the gaming experience by providing intelligent and responsive non-player characters (NPCs), generating dynamic content, and offering personalized interactions. These agents can adapt to the player's preferences and behavior, creating a more engaging and immersive experience. Furthermore, AI agents can assist in the development of games by automating repetitive tasks such as bug testing, level design, and character animation. This automation can significantly reduce development time and costs, allowing developers to focus on creativity and innovation. AI agents can also be used to analyze player data, providing insights into player behavior and preferences, which can inform game design and marketing strategies.\n\nThe integration of AI agents into virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) environments opens up new possibilities for immersive experiences. AI agents can act as guides, companions, or adversaries in VR and AR worlds, providing real-time interactions and adapting to the user’s actions and surroundings. This capability can enhance the sense of presence and immersion, making virtual experiences more engaging and realistic.\n\nTypes of Agent-based Gaming or Entertainment\nVirtual Companions\n\nVirtual companions are agents which offer individualized experiences with the user, designed to learn from their interactions with the user, adapting their responses and actions to better align with the user's preferences. These companions can range from idols which can interact with fans individually, to virtual friends or partners which can provide companionship, and virtual pets can simulate real pets. By utilizing user preferences to provide tailored experiences across different platforms, these agents unlock new possibilities in user's experience by creating a sense of companionship and connection.\n\nVirtual idols can engage with fans through personalized interactions, such as responding to messages, participating in live streams, and creating custom content. This level of interaction can deepen the connection between the idol and their fans, enhancing the overall fan experience. Virtual friends and partners can provide emotional support, companionship, and entertainment, making them valuable tools for combating loneliness and social isolation.\n\nVirtual pets can offer a unique form of companionship, simulating the behaviors and interactions of real pets. These AI-generated pets can learn from their interactions with the user, adapting their behaviors to better align with the user's preferences. This capability enhances the user's experience, making virtual pets more engaging and enjoyable.\n\nVirtual companions can also play a role in educational and therapeutic contexts. For example, AI tutors can provide personalized learning experiences, adapting to the student's learning style and pace, and in therapy, AI companions can offer emotional support and cognitive-behavioral therapy exercises. \n\nNPCs\n\nAI agents can be utilized as non-playable characters (NPCs) in video games, enhancing gaming experiences by retaining concepts across different games with cross-game memory. For example, an AI agent that plays NBA 2K with a user can also play PUBG on their phone and remember preferences across platforms. This cross-game memory allows for a more cohesive and personalized gaming experience, as the AI agent can adapt to the user's preferences and behavior across platforms.\n\nAI-generated NPCs can provide more dynamic and interactive gameplay by reacting to the player's actions and decisions. These NPCs can exhibit complex behaviors and adapt to the changing game environment, creating a more immersive and engaging experience for the player. Additionally, AI-generated NPCs can generate unique content, such as quests, missions, and challenges, enhancing the replayability and longevity of the game.\n\nThe ability of NPCs to learn and adapt over time can create a more realistic and engaging gaming experience. For instance, NPCs can develop relationships with players, remember past interactions, and alter their behavior based on previous encounters. This dynamic interaction can make games more immersive and provide a deeper sense of connection between players and the game world.\n\nAI-Generated Content (AGC)\n\nAI agents can create gaming assets and unique experiences for each player, extending the concept of user-generated content (UGC). This capability allows for dynamic and personalized game environments that adapt to individual player preferences. AI-generated content can include custom levels, quests, missions, characters, and items, enhancing the diversity and replayability of the game.\n\nAGC has the potential to be exponentially more transformative for gaming than traditional UGC. This potential depends on the quality of the AI agent and its ability to effectively communicate with and understand the environment in which it is building. High-quality AI agents can generate content that is diverse, engaging, and seamlessly integrated into the game world, significantly enhancing the overall player experience.\n\nImagine a world where AGC and UGC come together to create new, innovative worlds. In this scenario, AI agents could assist players in designing and building their creations, offering suggestions, automating repetitive tasks, and enhancing the complexity and detail of the content. Players, in turn, could fine-tune and personalize the AI-generated content, resulting in a collaborative creation process that blends the best of both worlds.\n\nThis symbiotic relationship between AGC and UGC could lead to the development of vibrant, ever-evolving game worlds. Players could explore environments that are continually being enriched by both the human imagination and the power of AI generation, creating a dynamic and immersive gaming experience.\n\nCase Studies\nVirtuals Protocol\n\nVirtuals Protocol is building an AI x Metaverse protocol that aims to be the future of virtual interactions. Their vision is to create a future where the worlds we engage with from our desks and couches aren't just escapes but extensions of our lives. Here, virtual interactions are hyper-personalized and hyper-immersive, enabled by AI and built in a decentralized manner. \n\nAs we increasingly integrate with virtual spaces, our interactions within these spaces will become more significant. Indeed, the transition to virtual spaces is looking increasingly inevitable. Virtuals Protocol is building multimodal (text, sound, visual) AI agents that can enhance these interactions in various ways. These AI agents can behave like mirror copies of popular IP characters, perform specific tasks, or act as personal copies of users themselves. Here are some real-world examples of how these multimodal AIs can be used:\n\nMirror Copies of IP Characters:\n\nA game where players can interact with a digital replica of John Wick, who not only looks and sounds like the character, but also exhibits his unique fighting style and personality. This can make gaming experiences more engaging and authentic.\n\nTask-Specific AIs:\n\nHorror Story Narrative Builder: An AI that can generate immersive horror narratives, adapting the story based on the player's choices and interactions.\n\nCompetitive DOTA Coach: An AI coach that can analyze your gameplay in real-time, offering tips and strategies to improve your skills and performance in competitive matches.\n\nPersonal Copies of Users:\n\nVirtual Assistants: AI agents that learn from your behavior and preferences to help manage your virtual and real-world tasks, such as scheduling and reminders.\n\nHow Virtuals Protocol Works\n\nVirtuals Protocol operates like a decentralized factory, producing AI agents that respond via text, voice and motion. Contributors add data and create AI models, validators ensure quality, and DApp founders use these agents to create immersive experiences. The AI agent modules include cognitive, voice and visual cores, each contributing to the agent's multimodal capabilities. The cognitive core processes information and makes decisions, the voice core enables auditory interactions, and the visual core provides a visual identity for the agent. These modules work together to create cohesive and interactive AI agents.\n\nOne of the key features of Virtuals Protocol is its audio-to-animation capability, allowing AI agents to generate animations based on audio inputs. This capability enhances the realism and immersion of virtual interactions, making AI agents more engaging and lifelike.\n\nVirtuals Protocol's decentralized approach ensures that AI agents are created and maintained by a community of contributors and validators. Validators play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and quality of the ecosystem while contributors can share their individual expertise and resources, improving the quality and functionality of AI agents.\n\nVirtuals Business Model \n\nIn order to coordinate behaviors among the various participants in its ecosystem, Virtuals Protocol utilizes its native $VIRTUAL token as a key feature of its business model. This economic model is largely contingent on a positive reflexive economic cycle referred to as the “Virtual-ous” flywheel. \n\nContributors are paid in $VIRTUAL tokens to develop virtual agents. These tasks could range from chatbot functionality and domain knowledge, to implementing audial and visual characteristics. These agents are then integrated into various decentralized applications (DApps) within the Virtuals ecosystem, which leverage the agents for various business operations for which the agents charge a fee. The revenue generated from these fees are then routed back into the protocol, which uses these funds to buy back $VIRTUAL tokens from the open market. This buyback serves to replenish the treasury with $VIRTUAL tokens, ensuring a steady supply for future incentives for contributors. Furthermore, $VIRTUAL token holders can indicate which agents they believe should receive more token emissions by staking their tokens accordingly. \n\nFuture Outlook and Considerations\n\nToday, Virtuals has seen 888.4k inferences on its platform, 175 active validators, 350 active contributors, and over 1k AI agents already contributed, as per the team’s self-reported statistics. \n\nVirtuals’ goal is to democratize the creation and monetization of AI agents, making high-quality virtual interactions accessible to a broader audience while pushing the industry in the right direction. Despite its promising vision, however, Virtuals Protocol may encounter significant challenges in sustaining and engaging a community over time due to market saturation. Decentralized AI protocols rely on a diverse set of stakeholders, including validators and contributors, to function effectively. Contributors, however, can easily be enticed by better incentive programs offered by competitors. In turn, without a steady organic stream of contributors, validators may not earn enough to maintain their presence, jeopardizing the entire ecosystem's stability.\n\nOne potential solution is to enforce exclusivity (at least temporarily) of contributors’ AI agents to the Virtuals Protocol in exchange for monetary rewards, incentivizing protocol growth through token incentives. However, this solution may not be viable for a number of reasons; primarily given the open-source nature of the protocol and that this concept generally contradicts the ethos of decentralization and openness that underpins the crypto community, while also being economically unsustainable over an extended period of time. \n\nMaintaining a balance between incentivizing contributions and adhering to these core principles remains a critical challenge for Virtuals Protocol and similar projects. Generally speaking, the developers contributing their AI models are the big winners in this blockchain-enabled future of decentralized AI repositories. Consider the similarities to the “streaming wars” – content is king.\n\nEchelon Prime \n\nParallel Studios, which has previously launched Parallel TCG and is stewarded by the Echelon Prime Foundation, is launching Colony. Colony is a new AI-powered Web3 survival simulation game built around highly autonomous AI agents called ‘avatars’. Players must guide and collaborate with their avatars to navigate a future Earth dotted with distinct colonies, all competing for survival. These AI avatars possess wide-ranging skills and capabilities, autonomously engaging with the environment via dedicated, token-bound smart contract wallets.\n\nParallel avatar NFTs \n\nHow Avatars Work \n\nEchelon Prime's AI avatars are designed to simulate human behavior, interacting with the world and formulating individualized approaches to different opportunities and challenges. At the level of a single game session, a player generally begins by chatting with their avatar, getting updates and discussing new ideas or missions the player may have for their avatar. With updates from the avatar having been transmitted, the player will determine tasks for the avatar to pursue. These can range from political activities, such as campaigning for a role within their colony, to pursuing personal goals, challenges, or actions specifically intended to contribute to the colony’s growth or success. \n\nOnce tasks are established, the avatar will proceed to complete them autonomously, managing its own survival stats by stopping to rest, eat, drink, and socialize as required. The AI avatars in Colony are designed to adapt to their environment, learning from their interactions and experiences. This continuous learning capability allows them to develop unique personalities and worldviews based on their identities and objectives. As a result, each avatar can offer a distinct and personalized experience to the player. \n\nBy providing a shared set of resources and tools, the Echelon Prime Foundation enables game studios to build within a standardized environment, enhancing interoperability and enriching the overall gaming experience. To bolster proactive participation from its vibrant community of developers and players, Echelon Prime implements a revenue-sharing mechanism for game studios and contributors.\n\nThe “Prime Redistribution Mechanisms” ensure sustainable token distribution within the Prime ecosystem. Tokens are distributed dynamically based on the difficulty of tasks, activity levels, and overall participation rates within the game. The primary vehicles for these distributions are in-game sinks where players spend PRIME tokens to access specific features. This approach supports a predictable and sustainable token supply, rewarding player participation and contributions effectively. The governance processes within Echelon Prime determine the exact tuning of these redistribution algorithms to ensure fairness and sustainability. Projects building on the Echelon ecosystem are required to detail their PRIME sink redistribution schedule and pass an Echelon community governance vote prior to accessing Echelon’s P2E pool and PRIMEsets, as well as Echelon-approved NFTs if applicable.\n\nAs with all games within the Echelon ecosystem, successful Colony players earn rewards in PRIME tokens, which they can use to pay for things in-game or sell. Leaderboards track competitions in different categories, with top players receiving the redistributed PRIME rewards for their accomplishments. \n\nExpected to launch in Q4 2024 - Q1 2025, Colony is a highly anticipated development in AI-agents gameplay, which will also utilize crypto assets as a key component of its in-game digital economy.\n\nHonorable Mentions \n\nMetapals: Metapals offers AI companions that provide personalized interactions and support.

While not a blockchain-enabled AI, Replika exemplifies the potential and current use of AI companions.\n\nChallenges Within the Broader AI Agents Landscape \n\nAs is often the case with new and complex technologies, there are a number of key challenges that must be overcome to see the successful development and adoption of AI agents across various industries such as gaming and entertainment. Some of the broader hurdles to overcome are as follows:\n\nData Privacy and Security\n\nThe onset of AI agents exponentially increases the overall breadth and volume of personal information and sensitive data that can be gathered and accessed. This is due to the ongoing human <> agent communication that is required, wherein the human provides instructions to the agent. As agents collect data from their interactions to reference for future operations, the issue arises in the nature, type, and purpose of information collected when humans are providing instructions to the agent. During communication with an AI agent, humans often assess the potential benefits and risks of sharing certain information, which in turn affects their usage behavior. The extent to which the risk of disclosing private information affects behavior thus plays a key role in the quality of experiences and the overall adoption of AI agents. \n\nPrior studies have shown that users of smart speakers, such as Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Echo, are unable to differentiate between input data that is collected and data that is kept private. This broader trend in consumer behavior is unlikely to change with the onset of consumer-centric AI-agents and applications. Meanwhile, research conducted on user privacy concerns and the nature of AI agents and assistants found that the higher the level of intimacy and familiarity a human feels with an agent, the more insensitive to their privacy concerns they become, which is particularly relevant in the context of entertainment motivations. More importantly, however, is that the user may feel more liberal in revealing their private information while forming intimacy with an AI agent when the user operates an AI agent as a useful device serving various utilities in their daily life. \n\nKey Ethical Concerns \n\nAssuming AI-agents are implemented in various enterprise and commercial settings, there is a natural concern which arises regarding the economic incentives upon which AI-agents are developed. Sacrificing the well-being of the consumer and broader society for economic benefit is not new in the world of corporations and enterprises. That said, in a world where politics and activism are playing an increasingly important role, this can bring attention to developers and sellers of AI-agents if ethical issues begin to surface. However, social media applications were found to be detrimental to the mental health of teenagers before and, while there may have been some fuss in the press at the time, precautions to protect youth from these technologies have been few and far between. \n\nA key ethical concern in the development of AI applications is the objectivity in the outputs they produce. An AI model itself is not biased, rather it is merely a reflection of its training input data. As such, it is paramount that the data collected and the processes are as holistic and objective as possible. \n\nSocietal Impacts of AI Companions\n\nAI companions could provide support for loneliness. However, they may also exacerbate the problem. Execution of interactions is critical to avoid attachment issues and backlash. AI companions must be designed to offer meaningful and supportive interactions, without fostering unhealthy dependencies or unrealistic expectations.\n\nFor instance, AI companions intended to provide emotional support must be capable of recognizing and responding to complex emotional cues, offering appropriate and empathetic responses. This capability requires advanced natural language processing and emotional intelligence algorithms, which can be challenging to develop and implement effectively.\n\nAdditionally, the rise of AI companions raises ethical and societal concerns related to privacy, security, and data ownership. Users must trust that their interactions with AI companions are secure and that their personal information is protected. Ensuring this level of trust requires transparent and robust data protection policies, as well as continuous monitoring and improvement of AI systems.\n\nPermissionlessness Is A Double-Edged Sword\n\nThe strength of blockchain networks lies in their permissionless nature, wherein anyone can participate from anywhere in the globe, unlocking broader democratic access to financial tooling and services. The permissionless nature of public blockchains, however, can be abused by programmable AI agents, posing risks such as social engineering hacks or DDOS attacks on DeFi protocols. The rise of smart contract-enabled AI agents could lead to the proliferation of bots across the blockchain. Ensuring the security and integrity of blockchain networks is critical to mitigating these risks.\n\nProgrammable AI agents on permissionless blockchains have the potential to execute malicious activities, such as manipulating smart contracts or launching coordinated attacks on decentralized applications. To address these risks, developers must implement robust security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, encrypted communication channels, and real-time threat detection systems.\n\nAnother risk associated with programmable AI agents is the potential for unintended consequences or emergent behaviors. As AI agents become more autonomous and capable, they may develop strategies or actions that were not anticipated by their creators. Ensuring that AI agents operate within ethical and legal boundaries requires continuous monitoring, testing, and refinement of AI systems.\n\nA pertinent example of AI bots causing disruption is their impact on social media platforms like Twitter. The proliferation of AI bots has significantly damaged user experience, leading to issues like misinformation and spam. Similar risks could translate to permissionless blockchains, where AI agents might engage in undesirable activities that undermine user trust and network stability.\n\nChallenges and Solutions for Implementing AI Agents in Open-Ended Environments\n\nThe deployment of AI agents in gaming and entertainment presents several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure their effective use in the open (virtual) world. Below, we delve deeper into specific technical challenges and explore potential solutions as highlighted in recent research. Though these challenges occurred with AI Agents outside of a blockchain-enabled environment, it’s likely decentralized AI Agents will face the same challenges as they begin to be deployed.\n\nSituation-Aware Planning\n\nOne of the significant challenges is the need for situation-aware planning. In open-world environments, there are various possible paths to achieving a goal and the agent must adapt its plan based on the current situation. For example, in a game like Minecraft, an agent needs to decide whether to gather resources from nearby areas or venture further based on its immediate surroundings and available tools.\n\nSolution: Multimodal Perception and Memory-Augmented Models\n\nTo tackle situation-aware planning, researchers have developed multimodal perception systems that combine visual observations and textual instructions to generate plans. The JARVIS-1 agent, for example, uses a multimodal memory to store past experiences, allowing it to retrieve relevant information and adjust its plans dynamically. By leveraging both pretrained knowledge and real-time environmental feedback, AI agents can perform more accurate and adaptive planning.\n\nTask Complexity\n\nThe complexity of tasks in open-world environments poses another challenge. Tasks often require a long planning horizon and precise execution steps. For instance, constructing a complex structure in a game may involve numerous sub-tasks that must be completed in a specific order.\n\nSolution: Iterative Prompting Mechanisms and Interactive Planning\n\nAI agents can overcome task complexity by using iterative prompting mechanisms and interactive planning frameworks. The Voyager agent employs an iterative prompting mechanism that incorporates environment feedback, execution errors, and self-verification to improve its plans continuously. This approach allows the agent to refine its actions based on real-time feedback, ensuring more reliable and effective task completion.\n\nLifelong Learning\n\nIn dynamic environments, AI agents must continuously learn and adapt to new tasks and challenges. Lifelong learning enables agents to progressively enhance their skills and knowledge over time, reducing the need for frequent retraining.\n\nSolution: Self-Instruct Mechanisms and Lifelong Learning Frameworks\n\nLifelong learning can be facilitated through self-instruct mechanisms and memory-augmented frameworks. JARVIS-1, for example, uses a self-instruct mechanism to propose new tasks for itself, enabling autonomous exploration and learning. Additionally, its multimodal memory stores successful plans and experiences, allowing the agent to build upon its past knowledge and improve its performance over time.\n\nLooking Forward: Catalysts for AI Agents Adoption\n\nDecentralized Hosting\n\nEnhancements in decentralized computing infrastructure and dynamic resource allocation frameworks are needed to improve the operational efficiency of decentralized AI. By leveraging decentralized networks, developers can distribute computational resources more effectively, ensuring that AI agents can operate efficiently and reliably across various environments.\n\nDecentralized hosting also offers advantages in terms of security and resilience. By distributing data and processing tasks across multiple nodes, decentralized networks can reduce the risk of single points of failure and enhance the overall robustness of AI systems. This approach can help mitigate the risks associated with centralized infrastructure, such as data breaches, system outages and performance bottlenecks.\n\nThe development of edge computing and fog computing technologies can further enhance the efficiency of decentralized AI. These technologies enable data processing closer to the source, reducing latency and improving real-time responsiveness. Integrating edge and fog computing with blockchain technology can create a more efficient and scalable infrastructure for AI agents.\n\nExpansion of Technology into Audio-to-Video Domain\n\nTechnological advancements will expand into audio-to-video domains, enhancing the capabilities of AI agents. By integrating audio and video processing capabilities, AI agents can offer more immersive and interactive experiences, engaging users through multiple sensory channels.\n\nThe integration of AI agents with advanced audio and video technologies can also enhance accessibility. For instance, AI agents can provide real-time translation and transcription services, making content more accessible to a global audience. AI agents can further assist users with disabilities by providing personalized and adaptive interfaces, improving their overall experience.\n\nDigital Proof of Humanity Solutions\n\nDigital proof of humanity solutions will become increasingly important to differentiate human vs. bot interactions. These solutions can leverage blockchain technology to create verifiable and tamper-proof records of human interactions, ensuring trust and security in digital environments.\n\nProof of humanity solutions can include biometric authentication, digital certificates and decentralized identity systems. These solutions can help verify the authenticity of users and prevent malicious attacks.\n\nImplementing proof of humanity solutions can enhance the security and integrity of digital interactions, fostering trust and confidence among users. These solutions can also support compliance with regulatory requirements, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, ensuring that digital platforms operate within legal and ethical boundaries.\n\nFurther AI Regulation\n\nFurther regulation is needed to ensure responsible AI development. Regulatory frameworks must evolve to address the ethical and legal implications of AI agents we touched on above. Regulation can help ensure that AI agents are developed and deployed in a manner that respects user privacy, security, and rights. By establishing clear guidelines and standards for AI development, regulators can promote accountability in AI systems.\n\nThe National AI Initiative Act of 2020, signed into law on January 1, 2021, focused on expanding AI research and development, creating the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office to oversee and implement the US national AI strategy. Outside of this bill, however, the US congress has yet to pass sweeping legislation to regulate the industry – though there have been several US states to take action.\n\nIn place of formal legislation, the White House has issued several directives to guide AI development. The Executive Order on AI, titled \"Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence,\" issued on November 1, 2023, emphasizes the need for federal agencies to develop standards for AI and mandates that developers of powerful AI systems share safety test results with the government. Furthermore, the White House Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, released in October 2022, provides principles for the equitable use and deployment of AI systems, covering areas such as algorithmic discrimination protection, data privacy, and human oversight.\n\nSeveral federal proposed laws also aim to regulate AI more comprehensively. The SAFE Innovation AI Framework, introduced in 2023, outlines bipartisan guidelines for AI developers and policymakers, while the REAL Political Advertisements Act, introduced in May 2023, seeks to regulate generative AI in political advertising. The AI Research Innovation and Accountability Act, introduced in June 2023, proposes establishing enforceable testing and evaluation standards for high-risk AI systems, requiring companies to produce transparency reports and adhere to sector-specific recommendations from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nThe European Union has taken a proactive approach with its Artificial Intelligence Act, likely to pass in 2024 and come into effect in 2026. The legal framework addresses the risks associated with AI without stifling innovation by utilizing a tiered system of governance. This legislation categorizes AI applications based on risk levels, from minimal to unacceptable, and imposes strict requirements on high-risk AI systems. These requirements include transparency, human oversight, and robust data governance. The United Kingdom published a 10-year plan in 2021, and a white paper in March 2023 which details their AI Strategy – with a focus on positioning the country as a “global leader in AI”. \n\nRegulating nascent industries like AI not only addresses ethical concerns but also drives further investment, integration, and adoption. Clear regulations reduce uncertainty for investors and businesses considering allocating resources to AI technologies. This is similar to the crypto industry, where players have lobbied for clearer regulation, believing that fair regulation will boost the industry. By providing a stable regulatory environment, policymakers can encourage investment and innovation, potentially accelerating the development and deployment of AI agents in a more responsible manner. These regulations will not only help mitigate potential risks but also promote the ethical development of AI agents, ensuring the positive impacts of the technology can be felt, while limiting the potential downside risk.\n\nBuilt-in “Kill Switch” on AI Agents\n\nImplementing a built-in \"kill switch\" on AI agents can help ensure responsible AI development. A kill switch allows developers to deactivate or modify AI agents if they exhibit unintended behaviors or pose risks to users and systems.\n\nThis capability can enhance the safety and reliability of AI agents, providing a mechanism for intervention and control in critical situations. By incorporating a kill switch into AI agents, developers can demonstrate their commitment to responsible AI development and build trust with users and stakeholders.\n\nThe kill switch can be designed to operate autonomously, monitoring AI agents' behavior and triggering deactivation if predefined thresholds are exceeded. This approach can help prevent potential harm or misuse, ensuring that AI agents operate within safe and ethical boundaries.\n\nDevelopers must also establish clear policies and procedures for the use of the kill switch, ensuring that it is used responsibly and transparently. These policies can include guidelines for monitoring AI agents, criteria for triggering the kill switch, and processes for reviewing and addressing issues that arise.\n\nConsumer Crypto Products\n\nAI agents can enhance ease of use for consumer crypto products, driving mainstream adoption, especially in gaming and entertainment. By offering personalized and intuitive interactions, AI agents can simplify complex tasks and improve the user experience.\n\nFor example, AI agents can assist users in managing their crypto assets, executing transactions, and navigating decentralized applications. This capability can make crypto products more accessible and user-friendly, encouraging more people to engage with blockchain technology.\n\nAdditionally, AI agents can provide educational and support services, helping users understand and navigate the crypto ecosystem. This capability can enhance user confidence and knowledge, driving further adoption and growth in the blockchain industry.\n\nAI agents can also play a role in ensuring the security of crypto products. For instance, AI agents can monitor transactions for suspicious activity, provide real-time alerts and assist in implementing security measures, such as multi-factor authentication and encrypted communication channels.\n\nThe integration of AI agents with crypto products can also support the development of new financial services and applications. For example, AI agents can provide users with innovative and personalized financial solutions through automated trading, portfolio management and decentralized finance (DeFi) services. Ultimately, AI agents can play a significant role in making self-custodial banking and other Web3 services a much less daunting endeavor – reducing points of friction that have impeded mass adoption to this point.\n\n\"Reality leaves a lot to the imagination. \" – John Lennon\n\nAs we look toward a future shaped by these advanced technologies, it is human imagination that will drive progress and create new realities.\n\nAI agents are poised to revolutionize gaming and entertainment by offering personalized immersive experiences. With blockchain technology providing a secure, transparent, and standardized environment for deploying AI agents, we are set to see significant advancements in these fields. The integration of AI agents into blockchain ecosystems will enable developers to create more engaging experiences for users, driving innovation and growth.\n\nThe successful implementation of AI agents requires continuous advancements in technology and regulation. Developers must address the challenges and risks associated with AI agents, ensuring that they operate within ethical and legal boundaries. By fostering collaboration and innovation, the industry can harness the full potential of AI agents, creating a future where virtual interactions are more immersive and meaningful.\n\nAs AI technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see more sophisticated and capable AI agents that enhance our digital experiences, enrich our lives, and drive the next wave of technological advancement in the gaming and entertainment industries. \n\nReferences\n\nAlgorithmic Scale.

However, due to major companies and governments mass-accumulating these resources, startups and independent developers face a shortage of GPUs in the market today, leading to excessive costs and/or lack of accessibility.\n\nCompute DePINs enable decentralized marketplaces for compute resources such as GPUs, by allowing anyone in the world to provide their idle supply in exchange for a monetary reward. This aims to help underserved GPU consumers tap into a new stream of supply, obtaining the development resources needed for their workloads with reduced costs and overhead.\n\nThere are still a number of economic and technical challenges compute DePINs face in competing with traditional, centralized service providers today, some of which will solve themselves over time and some which will require new solutions and optimizations moving forward.\n\nCompute Is The New Oil\n\nSince the onset of the industrial revolution, technology has helped propel humanity forward at an unprecedented rate, with almost every facet of everyday life being influenced or entirely transformed. The computer ultimately emerged as a culmination of efforts across a collective of researchers, academics, and computer engineers. Originally designed for solving large-scale arithmetic tasks used to assist in advanced military operations, computers have evolved to become the backbone of modern day life. As computers’ impact on humanity continues to grow at an unprecedented rate, the demand for these machines and the resources that power them continues to grow as well, outpacing available supply. This in turn creates market dynamics in which a majority of developers and businesses are priced out of access to critical resources, leaving the development of machine learning and generative artificial intelligence, arguably the most transformative technologies of today, in the hands of a few well-funded players. Meanwhile, the abundant supply of idle compute resources presents a lucrative opportunity to help alleviate the imbalance between compute supply and demand, exacerbating the need for sufficient coordination mechanisms between participants on both sides of the trade. As such, we believe decentralized systems enabled by blockchain technology and digital assets are critical to the proliferation of a broader, more democratic and responsible development of generative artificial intelligence-based goods and services. \n\nCompute Resources \n\nCompute can be defined as the various activities, applications or workloads in which a computer emits a definitive output based on a given input. Ultimately it refers to the computation and processing power of a computer, which is the core utility of these machines powering much of the modern world today, generating up to $1.1T in revenue over the past year alone. \n\nCompute resources refer to various hardware and software components which enable computation and processing. These components have become increasingly important as the number of applications and features they enable continues to grow, becoming increasingly present in people’s everyday lives. This has led to a race among national powers and businesses to accumulate as many of these resources as possible as a means of sustenance. This is reflected in the market performance of companies providing these resources (e.g. Nvidia, whose market capitalization has grown over 3000% in the past 5 years). \n\nGPUs \n\nGraphics Processing Units, or GPUs, are specialized hardware components which have become one of the most significant resources in modern high-performance computing. At their core, GPUs function as specialized electric circuits, employing parallel processing to accelerate computer graphics workloads. Originally serving the gaming and personal computer industries, GPUs have since evolved to serve many of the nascent technologies shaping the future of the world (i.e mainframes and personal computers, mobile devices, cloud computing, Internet-Of-Things). However, demand for these resources is particularly exacerbated by the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence - GPUs accelerate ML and AI operations by performing calculations in parallel, thereby enhancing the processing power and capabilities of the end-result technologies. \n\nThe Rise of AI \n\nAt its core, AI is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and problem-solving capabilities. An AI model functions as a neural network made up of many chunks of different data. The model requires processing power to identify and learn the relationships between this data, which it then references when creating an output based on a given input. \n\nAI development and production is not new; in 1967 Frank Rosenblatt built the Mark 1 Perceptron, the first computer based on a neural network that \"learned\" through trial and error. Further, a great deal of academic research that founded the development of AI as we know it today was published in the late 90s and early 2000s and the industry has continued to develop since. \n\nBeyond research and development efforts, ‘narrow’ AI models have been powering various robust applications used today. Examples include social media algorithms, such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa, custom-tailored product recommendations, and more. Notably the rise of deep learning has transformed the development of artificial generative intelligence (AGI). Deep learning algorithms utilize larger, or ‘deeper’ neural networks than machine learning applications do, functioning as more scalable alternatives with more extensive performance capabilities. Generative AI models ‘encode a simplified representation of their training data and reference it to emit a new output that is similar, but not identical, to the original data.’\n\nDeep learning has enabled developers to extend generative AI models to images, speech, and other complex data types, and milestone-applications like ChatGPT, which has already set records for the fastest-growing userbase in modern times, are still just early iterations of what can be made possible with generative AI and deep learning. \n\nWith this in mind, it should be of little surprise that generative AI development entails multiple computationally-intensive workloads, which require exorbitant amounts of processing power and compute. \n\nAccording to  Triple Whammy of Deep Learning Application Demand, the development of AI applications is constrained by several key workloads; \n\nTraining - Models must process and analyze large datasets in order to learn how to respond to given inputs. \n\nTuning - Models undergo a series of repetitive processes, in which various hyperparameters are adjusted and optimized in order to refine performance and quality. \n\nSimulations - Prior to deployment, certain models, i.e. reinforcement learning algorithms, undergo a series of simulations for testing purposes. \n\nCompute Crunch: Demand > Supply \n\nOver the past few decades, a myriad of technological advancements have fueled an unprecedented surge in demand for compute and processing power. As a result, the demand for compute resources such as GPUs far exceeds the available supply today, creating a bottleneck in AI development that will only continue to grow without efficient solutions. \n\nThe broader constraints in supply are further bolstered by a large number of companies actively purchasing GPUs beyond their actual needs, both as a competitive advantage and a means of survival in the modern global economy. Compute providers often employ contract structures which require long-term capital commitments, granting customers with supply  often far beyond their demand requirements. \n\nResearch by Epoch shows the overall number of compute-intensive AI model releases is rapidly growing, signaling that demand for the resources powering these technologies will continue to grow at a rapid pace. \n\nA FLOP, or Floating Point Operation, is a measure of computational performance, particularly in tasks involving real-number calculations, which are common in AI and machine learning algorithms. In short, 1023 FLOP models refer to models requiring an immense amount of computational power. \n\nAs the complexity of AI models continues to grow, so will the computational and processing power demands of application developers. In turn, the performance of GPUs, and their subsequent availability, will play an increasingly significant role as well. This is already coming to fruition as the demand for high-end GPUs, such as ones produced by Nvidia, who has hailed GPUs as the ‘rare earth metals’ or ‘gold’ of the AI industry. \n\nThis rapid commercialization of AI risks ceding control to a small group of tech giants similar to the social media industry today, raising concerns around the ethical foundation of these models. A well-known example of this is the recent controversy with Google Gemini. Its many odd replies to various prompts did not pose any actual danger at the time, the event is an example of the inherent risk of having a small subset of companies dictate and dominate AI development. \n\nTech startups today face growing challenges in accessing compute resources to power their AI models. These applications perform numerous compute-intensive processes before a model may even be deployed. Accumulating massive amounts of GPUs is a largely unsustainable endeavor for smaller businesses and while traditional cloud computing services like AWS or Google Cloud offer a seamless and convenient developer experience, their limited capacity ultimately leads to high costs that price out many developers. Ultimately, not everyone can propose to raise $7T for their hardware costs either. \n\nSo what gives?\n\nNvidia has previously estimated that over 40K companies use GPUs for AI and accelerated computing, with a global community of over 4M developers. Looking ahead, the global AI market is projected to grow from $515 billion in 2023 to $2.74 trillion by 2032, with a CAGR of 20.4%. Concurrently, the GPU market is expected to reach $400 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 25%.\n\nHowever, a growing imbalance between the supply and demand of compute resources in the wake of the AI revolution stands to create a rather dystopian future, wherein a small concentrated set of well-funded megacorps dictate much of the development of transformative technologies. As such, we believe all roads lead to decentralized alternative solutions to help bridge the gap between AI developers’ demands and the available resources at their disposal. \n\nThe Role of DePINs \nWhat are DePINs? \n\nDePIN is a colloquial term coined together by the Messari research team, which stands for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks. To break this down, decentralization comes from the lack of a single entity extracting rent and restricting access. Meanwhile, physical infrastructure refers to the ‘real-life’ physical resources which are utilized. A network refers to a set of actors working together in a coordinated manner to achieve a predetermined goal or set of goals. Today, the total market cap of DePINs is roughly $28.3B. \n\nAt their core, DePINs are global networks of nodes which connect physical infrastructure resources with blockchains to enable decentralized marketplaces connecting buyers and suppliers of said resource, wherein anyone can become a supplier and be compensated for their services and the value they add to the network. In this case, the central intermediary, who restricts access to the network through various legal and regulatory means and service fees, is replaced by a decentralized protocol made of smart contracts and code, governed by its respective token holders. \n\nDePINs are valuable because they offer decentralized, accessible, low-cost, and scalable alternatives to traditional resource networks and service providers. They enable decentralized marketplaces that aim to serve a particular end-game; where the costs of goods and services are determined by the dynamics of the markets, which anyone can participate in at any time, naturally driving down unit costs over time as a result of a greater number of suppliers and minimized profit margins. \n\nUsing blockchains enables DePINs to build cryptoeconomic incentive systems which help ensure that network participants are appropriately compensated for their services, turning key value providers into stakeholders. However, it is important to note that network effects, which are realized by transforming small individual networks into larger, productive systems, are critical in order to realize many of the benefits of DePINs. Furthermore, while token rewards have proven to be compelling bootstrapping mechanisms for networks, building sustainable incentives to aid in user retention and long-term adoption has proven to remain a critical challenge in the broader DePIN landscape. \n\nHow Do DePINs Work? \n\nIn order to better understand the value DePINs provide in enabling decentralized compute marketplaces, it’s important to recognize the different structural components involved and how they work together to form decentralized resource networks. Let’s consider the structure of a DePIN and the participants involved. \n\nThe Protocol \n\nA decentralized protocol, i.e. a set of smart contracts built on top of an underlying ‘base layer’ blockchain network, serves to facilitate trustless interactions among network participants. In an ideal world, the protocol is to be governed by a diverse set of stakeholders who are actively determined to contribute to the long-term success of the network. These stakeholders then use their share of the protocol’s tokens to vote on proposed changes and developments to the DePIN. Given that coordinating a distributed network successfully is a great challenge in itself, the core team will often reserve the power to implement these changes initially, before transitioning the power to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). \n\nNetwork Participants \n\nThe end-users of resource networks are their most valuable participants, and they can be categorized by their function. \n\nSuppliers: Individuals or entities providing a resource to the network, in exchange for a monetary reward paid out in the DePIN’s native token. Suppliers ‘connect’ to the network through the blockchain-native protocol, which may enforce a whitelisted onboarding process or a permissionless one. By receiving tokens, suppliers receive a stake in the network, akin to stakeholders in an equity-ownership context, which enables them to vote on various proposals and developments of the network, such as ones they believe will help drive demand and value to the network, creating a higher token price over time. Of course, suppliers receiving tokens are just as likely to utilize DePINs as a form of passive income and sell their tokens upon receiving them. \n\nConsumers: These are individuals or entities that are actively searching for the resource provided by the DePIN, such as AI startups seeking GPUs, representing the demand side of the economic equation. Consumers are compelled to use a DePIN if there are actual advantages over using traditional alternatives today that can be realized, i.e. lower costs and overhead requirements, therefore representing the network’s organic demand. DePINs often require consumers to pay for resources in their native token as a means of generating value and maintaining a steady cash-flow. \n\nResources \n\nDePINs can serve different markets and employ different business models to distribute resources. Blockworks provides a great framework for this; custom hardware DePINs, which provide specialized proprietary hardware to suppliers to be distributed, and commodity hardware DePINs, which enable the distribution of existing, idle resources including but not limited to compute, storage, and bandwidth. \n\nEconomics \n\nIn an ideally-functioning DePIN, value accrues from the revenue generated by consumers paying for suppliers’ resources. Sustained demand for the network implies sustained demand for the native token, which aligns with the economic incentives of suppliers and token holders. Generating sustainable organic demand at an early stage poses a challenge for most startups, which is why DePINs will provide inflationary token incentives to incentivize early suppliers and bootstrap the network’s supply as a means of generating demand and therefore more organic supply. This is fairly similar to VCs subsidizing Uber riders’ costs during the firm’s initial stages as a means of bootstrapping an initial customer base to further attract drivers and bolster its network effects. \n\nIt’s important for DePINs to manage token incentives as strategically as possible, as they play a critical role in the overall success of the network. When demand and network revenue rises, token emissions should decrease. Conversely, when demand and revenue falls, token emissions should be utilized to incentive supply again. \n\nTo further illustrate what a successful DePIN network would look like, consider the ‘DePIN Flywheel’, a positive reflexive cycle for bootstrapping DePINs.  In summary:\n\nThe DePIN distributes inflationary token rewards to incentive suppliers to provide resources to the network and establish a base level of supply available for consumption. \n\nAssuming the number of suppliers begins to grow, competitive dynamics begin to form in the network, raising the overall quality of the goods and services offered by the network to the point where it provides a better offering than that of existing market solutions, gaining a competitive advantage in turn. This implies a decentralized system surpasses that of traditional, centralized service providers, which is not an easy task by any means. \n\nOrganic demand for the DePIN begins to form, providing legitimate cash-flows to suppliers. This poses a compelling opportunity for investors and suppliers alike, which continues to drive network demand and consequently token price. \n\nGrowth in token prices increases suppliers’ earnings, attracting more suppliers and resuming the flywheel. \n\nThis framework provides a compelling growth strategy, though it's important to note it is largely theoretical, and assumes the network is providing a resource at a competitive offering that continues to be relevant over a prolonged period of time. \n\nCompute DePINs\n\nDecentralized compute markets fall under the scope of a broader movement referred to as ‘The Sharing Economy’, a peer-to-peer economic system built on consumers sharing goods and services directly with other consumers through online platforms. This model was pioneered by the likes of eBay, is dominated today by companies like Airbnb and Uber, and is ultimately primed for disruption as the next generation of transformative technologies hit global markets by storm. Worth $150b in 2023, the sharing economy has been forecast to grow to nearly $800b in value worldwide by 2031, demonstrating a broader trend in consumer behavior which we believe DePINs will benefit from and play a critical role in enabling. \n\nSharing Economy (courtesy of FourPillars) \nThe Fundamentals \n\nCompute DePINs are peer-to-peer networks which facilitate the distribution of computing resources by connecting suppliers and buyers through decentralized marketplaces. A key distinction to these networks is that they specialize in commodity hardware resources, which are already available at the disposal of many people today. As we discussed, the emergence of deep learning and generative AI have created a surge in demand for processing power due to their resource-intensive workloads, creating a bottleneck in access to critical resources for AI development. Put simply, decentralized compute marketplaces aim to ease these bottlenecks by creating a new stream of supply - one that spans across the globe and anyone can participate in. \n\nIn a compute DePIN any individual or entity can lend their idle resources at a moment’s notice and be compensated for their services appropriately. Meanwhile, any individual or entity can access the necessary resources from a global permissionless network, at lower costs and with greater flexibility than existing market offerings. As such, we can frame the participants involved in compute DePINs through a simple economic framework: \n\nSupply Side: Individuals or entities who own compute resources and are willing to lend or sell their compute for a subsidy.\n\nDemand Side: Individuals or entities who need compute and are willing to pay a price for it. \n\nKey Benefits of Compute DePINs\n\nCompute DePINs offer a number of benefits that make them compelling alternatives to centralized service providers and marketplaces. For starters, enabling permissionless, cross-border access to market participation unlocks a new stream of supply, increasing the number of available key resources required for compute-intensive workloads. Compute DePINs specialize in resources that require hardware that most people own already - anyone who owns a gaming PC already has a GPU they can rent out. This broadens the scope of developers and teams able to participate in building the next-generation of goods and services across a broader range of markets and industries therefore benefiting a larger net sum of people across the world. \n\nLooking further, the blockchain infrastructure underpinning DePINs provides the highly efficient and scalable settlement rails for micropayments needed to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions. Crypto-native financial assets (tokens) provide a shared unit of value that participants on the demand side use to pay the suppliers, aligning economic incentives through distribution mechanisms that align with today’s increasingly globalized economy. To reference our construct of the DePIN flywheel from earlier, strategically managing economic incentives can be highly beneficial to growing a DePIN’s network effects (on both the supply and demand side) which in turn increases competition among suppliers. This dynamic drives down unit costs while raising the quality of service offerings, creating a sustainable competitive advantage for the DePIN, which suppliers can benefit from as token holders and key value providers. \n\nDePINs function similarly to cloud computing service providers in the flexible user experience they aim to deliver, where resources can be accessed and paid for on an on-demand basis. For reference, Grandview Research forecasts the global cloud computing market size to grow at a CAGR of 21.2% to reach over $2.4T by 2030, demonstrating the viability of such business models in light of the predicted growth in future demand for computing resources. Modern cloud computing platforms utilize a central server to handle all communication between client devices and servers, creating a single point of failure in their operations. Building on top of blockchains, however, allows for DePINs to offer stronger censorship-resistance and resilience than traditional service providers. While an attack on a single organization or entity, i.e. a central cloud service provider, jeopardizes the entire underlying resource network, DePINs are structured to be resistant to such incidents through their distributed nature. For starters, blockchains themselves are globally distributed networks of specialized nodes built to be resilient from centralized network authority. In addition, compute DePINs also allow for permissionless network participation, bypassing legal and regulatory barriers. And depending on the nature of a token’s distribution, DePINs can employ fair voting processes for proposed changes and developments to the protocol to eliminate the possibility of a single entity suddenly shutting down the entire network. \n\nThe State of Compute DePINs Today\nRender Network \n\nRender Network is a compute DePIN connecting buyers and sellers of GPUs through a decentralized compute marketplace in which transactions are facilitated through its native token. There are two key parties involved in Render’s GPU marketplace - Creators, who are seeking to access processing power, and Node Operators, who rent out idle GPUs to Creators in exchange for compensation in native Render tokens. Node operators are ranked on a reputation-based system, and creators can select GPUs from a multi-tiered pricing system. The Proof-of-Render (POR) consensus algorithm coordinates operations and the node operator commits their computing resources (GPU) to process the task, a graphics rendering job. Upon delivering the job, the POR algorithm updates the node operator's status, including changes to the reputation score based on the quality of the task delivered. Render’s blockchain infrastructure facilitates payments for jobs, providing transparent and efficient settlement rails for suppliers and buyers to transact through the network token. \n\nOriginally conceived in 2009 by Jules Urbach, the network went live in September 2020 on Ethereum (RNDR) before migrating to Solana roughly three years later (RENDER) for improved network performance and lower costs of operations. \n\nAt the time of writing, the Render Network has processed up to 33m jobs (as frames rendered), and has grown up to 5600 total nodes since inception. Just under 60k RENDER has been burned, a process which takes place during the distribution of work credits to node operators. \n\nIO Net \n\nIo Net is launching a decentralized GPU network based on top of Solana, which will serve as a coordination layer between a vast supply of idle compute resources and a growing number of individuals and entities in need of the processing power these resources provide. Io Net’s unique selling proposition is that rather than directly competing with other DePINs on the market, it instead aggregates GPUs from a variety of sources including data centers, miners, and other DePINs including Render Network and Filecoin, while utilizing the Internet-of-GPUs (IoG), a proprietary DePIN, to coordinate operations and align incentives among market participants. Io Net clients are able to customize clusters for their workloads on the IO Cloud by selecting processor type, location, communication speeds, compliance, and duration of services. Conversely, anyone who owns a supported GPU model (12 GB RAM,256 GB SSD) can participate as an IO Worker, by lending out their idle compute to the network. While payments for services are currently settled in fiat and USDC, the network will soon support payments in the native $IO token as well. Prices paid for resources are algorithmically determined by their supply and demand, as well as various GPU specs and configurations.  Io Net’s end-goal is becoming the go-to GPU marketplace by offering lower costs and better quality of service than modern cloud service providers.\n\nThe multi-layered IO architecture can be mapped out as follows:\n\nUI Layer - Composed of the public website, customers area, and Workers area. \n\nSecurity Layer - This layer is composed of a Firewall for network protection, an Authentication Service for user validation, and a Logging Service for tracking activities.\n\nAPI Layer - This layer functions as a communication layer, and is composed of; a public API for the website, private APIs for Workers, and internal APIs for cluster management, analytics, and monitoring and reporting. \n\nBackend Layer - The backend layer manages Workers, Cluster/GPU operations, customer interactions, billing and usage monitoring, analytics, and Autoscaling. \n\nDatabase Layer - This layer is the system’s data repository, using Main storage for structured data and Caching for temporary data that can be frequently accessed. \n\nMessage Broker and Tasks Layer - This layer facilitates asynchronous communications and task management.\n\nInfrastructure Layer - This layer houses the GPU Pool, orchestration tools, and manages task deployment. \n\nCurrent Stats / Roadmap \n\nAt the time of writing;\n\nTotal Network Earnings - $1.08m  \n\nTotal Compute Hours Earned - 837.6k hours\n\nTotal Cluster-Ready GPUs - 20.4K\n\nTotal Cluster-Ready CPUs - 5.6k\n\nTotal On-chain Transactions - 1.67m \n\nTotal Inferences - 335.7k\n\nTotal Clusters Created - 15.1k\n\nData sourced from the Io Net explorer\n\nAethir \n\nAethir is a cloud computing DePIN which facilitates the sharing of high-performance computational resources for compute-intensive domains and applications. It utilizes resource pooling, to enable global GPU distribution at significantly reduced costs, and decentralized ownership through distributed resource possession. Aether was designed with a distributed GPU framework specifically tailored for high-performance workloads in industries like gaming and AI model training and inference. By unifying GPU clusters into a single network, Aethir’s design aims to increase cluster sizes, thereby improving overall performance and reliability of the services offered on its network. \n\nThe Aethir Network is a decentralized economy composed of miners, developers, users, token holders, and the Aethir DAO. Three key roles are involved in ensuring successful network operations - the container, the indexer, and the checker. Containers function as the powerhouses of the network, working as specialized nodes which fulfill critical operations in maintaining the liveness of the network, including validating transactions and rendering digital content in real time. Checkers function as quality assurance workers, continuously monitoring the performance and service quality of the Containers to ensure reliable and efficient operations suitable for the requirements of GPU consumers. Indexers function as matchmakers connecting users to the best available Container for their services. Underpinning this entire structure is the Arbitrum Layer 2 blockchain, which provides a decentralized settlement layer to facilitate the payment of goods and services on the Aethir network in the native $ATH token. \n\nProof of Rendering \n\nNodes in the Aethir network serve two key functions - Proof of Rendering Capacity, where a group of these workers is randomly chosen to validate transactions every 15 minutes, and Proof of Rendering Work, which closely monitors network performance to ensure that users get the best possible service, adjusting resources based on their demand and geographic location. Mining rewards are distributed to participants running nodes on the Aethir network, for the value they provide in the compute resources they lend out, in the native $ATH token. \n\nNosana \n\nNosana is a decentralized GPU network built on top of Solana. Nosana allows anyone to contribute idle compute resources and earn rewards in the form of the $NOS token for doing so. The DePIN facilitates the distribution of affordable and efficient GPUs, which can be used for running complex AI workloads without the overhead of traditional cloud solutions. Anyone can run a Nosana node by lending out idle GPUs, earning token rewards proportional to the GPU power they provide to the network.\n\nThe network connects two parties involved in the distribution of computing resources: users seeking to access compute and node operators who provide the compute. Important protocol decisions and upgrades are voted on by NOS token holders and governed by the Nosana DAO.\n\nNosana has laid out an extensive roadmap for its future plans - Galactica (v1.0 - H1/H2 2024) will launch the main grid, release the CLI and SDK, and focus on network scaling with a Container Node for consumer GPUs. Triangulum (v1.X - H2 2024) will integrate major machine learning protocols and connectors for PyTorch, HuggingFace, and TensorFlow. Whirlpool (v1.X - H1 2025) will expand support to diverse GPUs from AMD, Intel, and Apple Silicon. Sombrero (v1.X - H2 2025) will add support for medium and large businesses, fiat currency ramping, billing, and team functionalities. \n\nAkash \n\nThe Akash network is an open-source Proof-of-Stake network built on top of the Cosmos SDK, which enables a decentralized cloud compute marketplace that is permissionless to join and contribute to. The $AKT token is used to secure the network, facilitate payments for resources, and coordinate economically aligned behavior among network participants. The Akash network consists of several key components;\n\nThe Blockchain Layer, which provides consensus using the Tendermint Core and Cosmos SDK. \n\nThe Application Layer, which manages deployments and the allocation of resources. \n\nThe Provider Layer, which manages resources, bids, and user application deployments. \n\nThe User Layer, which enables users to interact with the Akash network, manage resources, and monitor application status using their CLI, Console, and Dashboard.\n\nInitially focusing on storage and CPU leasing services, the network has since expanded its offerings to the renting and distribution of GPUs with its AkashML platform, a response to the growing demand for these grown with the onset of AI training and inference workloads and their processing power requirements. AkashML utilizes a 'reverse auction' system, where customers, known as Tenants, submit their desired price for GPUs, and compute suppliers, known as Providers, compete to be the ones to supply the requested GPUs in turn. \n\nAt the time of writing, the Akash blockchain has seen over 12.9 million total transactions, over $535k has been spent to access computing resources, and over 189k unique deployments were leased out. \n\nHonorable Mentions \n\nThe compute DePIN sector is still developing, with lots of teams competing to bring innovative and efficient solutions to the market. Additional examples warranting further research; Hyperbolic is building a collaborative open-access platform for resource pooling for AI development, Exabits is building a distributed computing power network underpinned by computing miners, and Shaga is building a network that allows PC lending and monetization for server-side gaming on Solana.\n\nImportant Considerations & Future Outlook \n\nNow that we’ve gone through the fundamentals of compute DePINs and reviewed several supplemental case studies in action today, it's important to consider the implications of these decentralized networks, including the good and the bad. \n\nChallenges \n\nBuilding out distributed networks at scale can often require tradeoffs to be made around performance relative to security, resiliency etc. For instance, training AI models can be much less cost-effective and time-efficient on a network of globally distributed commodity hardware that isn't cost-effective or time-efficient. As we have alluded to previously, AI models and their workloads are becoming increasingly complex, requiring more high-performance GPUs than commodity ones. \n\nThis is why bigger corporations hoard high-performance GPUs en masse, and it is an inherent challenge to compute DePINs that aim to address the GPU shortage by establishing a permissionless market where anyone can lend idle supply (see this tweet for more on challenges with decentralized AI protocols). Protocols can address this in two key ways: by establishing baseline requirements for GPU providers looking to contribute to the network, and by pooling compute resources provided to the network to achieve a greater whole. Nonetheless, this model is inherently challenging to build relative to centralized service providers who can allocate more capital to make direct deals with hardware providers, such as Nvidia. This is something that DePINs should take into consideration moving forward. If a decentralized protocol has a large-enough treasury, the DAO can vote to allocate a portion of funds to purchase high-performance GPUs that can be managed in a decentralized way and lent out at a higher rate than commodity GPUs. \n\nAnother challenge specific to compute DePINs is managing the right amount of resource utilization. In their early stages, most compute DePINs will face a lack of structural demand, as many startups do today. Generally, DePINs face the challenge of building up enough supply early on to even attain a minimum viable product quality. Without supply, the network will fail to generate sustainable demand, nor will it be able to serve its customers during periods of peak demand. On the other side of this equation is the concern of excess supply. Beyond a certain threshold, more supply in a network is only helpful when its utilization is at or near full capacity. Otherwise, the DePIN runs the risk of overpaying for supply, which in turn leads to underutilization of resources, meaning suppliers’ earnings decrease unless the protocol raises token emissions to keep them around.\n\nIn the same way a mobile communications network isn’t useful without wide geographic coverage, a DePIN isn’t useful if it must pay people to supply resources over a prolonged period of time. While centralized service providers can predict demand for resources and manage supply efficiently, compute DePINs lack a central authority to manage this utilization. Therefore, it is particularly important for DePINs to establish resource utilization as strategically as possible. \n\nA bigger picture concern which arises for decentralized GPU marketplaces in particular, is that the GPU shortage may be coming to an end. Mark Zuckerberg has recently stated in an interview that he believes energy will be the new bottleneck, not compute resources, as businesses will now be scrambling to build out data centers en masse as opposed to hoarding compute resources the way they do now. Of course, this implies potentially reduced costs for GPUs from a relief in demand, but it also raises the question of how AI startups will be able to compete with conglomerates on performance and quality of goods and services offered, if building out proprietary data centers raises the overall standard of AI model performance to unprecedented levels. \n\nThe Case for Compute DePINs \n\nTo reiterate, there is a growing disparity between the complexity of AI models and their subsequent processing and compute demands and the number of high-performance GPUs and other computing resources available to meet this demand. \n\nCompute DePINs stand to be innovative disruptors in the field of compute marketplaces, which are dominated by major hardware manufacturers and cloud computing service providers today, on the basis of several key capabilities:\n\n1) Providing lower costs of goods and services.\n\n2) Offering stronger censorship-resistance and network resiliency guarantees.\n\n3) Benefiting from potential regulatory guidelines for AI which require that AI models are as open as possible to fine-tuning and training, and can be easily accessed by anyone anywhere.\n\nThe percentage of households with computers and internet access in the US has grown exponentially, getting closer to 100%. It has also grown significantly around many parts of the world. This indicates a potential abundance of compute resource providers (GPU owners) who would be willing to loan idle supply if there is sufficient monetary incentive to do so, and a seamless transactional process with minimal barriers to entry. Of course, this is a very, very rough estimate, but it speaks to the fact that the foundation for building out a sustainable sharing economy of compute resources may just be in place. \n\nThinking beyond AI, future demand for compute will come from many other industries as well, such as quantum computing. The quantum computing market size is projected to grow from $928.8 million in 2023 to $6,528.8 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 32.1%. The production of this industry will require different kinds of resources but it will be interesting to see if any quantum-computing DePINs launch and what those would look like. \n\n“A strong ecosystem of open models running on consumer hardware are an important hedge to protect against a future where value captured by AI is hyper-concentrated and most human thought becomes read and mediated by a few central servers controlled by a few people. Such models are also much lower in terms of doom risk than both corporate megalomania and militaries.” - Vitalik Buterin  \n\nMajor enterprises are likely not the target audience for DePINs nor will they be. Compute DePINs brings back the individual developer, the scrappy builder, the start-up with minimal capital and resources. They allow for the transformation of idle supply into innovative ideas and solutions enabled by a greater abundance of compute. AI will no doubt change the lives of billions of people. Instead of fearing that it will replace everyone’s jobs, we should encourage the idea that AI can empower individuals and self-entrepreneurs, start-ups, and the broader general public.\n\nDePINs do not guarantee a future world with fair access to AI development, but they provide one of the best opportunities to start building one.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAkash.

Over time, nearly every team and developer will want to own their economics and users and, even if this can be done on general-purpose execution environments like Solana, the application depends on the throughput of these environments, which has historically demonstrated to be unreliable at times. If we believe that a paradigm shift into blockchain technology is imminent, the logical next conclusion is hundreds of execution environments specialized for the applications that are building on it. We can already see this playing out today, with applications like dYdX, Hyperliquid, Frax, and other nascent projects becoming standalone app-chains and rollups. Furthermore, it is also likely that Layer 2 scaling solutions exist in tandem with Layer 1s, as a smaller set of nodes can communicate globally significantly faster than a larger set. This would allow L2s, like rollups, to scale to virtually no limit, while inheriting security from L1s and having a 1/N trust assumption (as opposed to having high quorums to reach consensus like L1s do). In essence, we envision a future with hundreds of L1s and L2s. \n\nHowever, even in the current state of having only a few dozen L1s and L2s, we’ve already seen concerns being voiced about substantial UX hurdles in this multi-chain present. A multi-chain future therefore has many problems to overcome including fragmented liquidity, complexity for end users with multiple bridges, RPC endpoints, different gas tokens and markets. Until now, there still hasn’t been a sufficient methodology for abstracting these UX complexities in a world with a few L1s and L2s. One can only imagine how unusable blockchains will be for end-users if the multi-chain ecosystem continues to grow without fixing these significant UX hurdles first. \n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nSubscribe\n\nThe internet didn’t get to where it is by having its users understand its core protocols like HTTP, TCP/IP, UDP. Instead, it abstracted away technical nuances and allowed the layman to use it. Over time, the exact same will be true for blockchains and blockchain-native applications. \n\nIn crypto, users need to deploy liquidity across multiple L1s and L2s, settle for a suboptimal UX by having on-chain liquidity sources fragmented across these L1s and L2s, and have an understanding of the technical nuances of these systems. It has come the time to abstract away everything from the average user – as far as they’re concerned, they don’t need to know they’re using blockchain rails, let alone how many L1s and L2s exist under the hood, for this is the only way the industry gains mass adoption. \n\nWhy Chain Abstraction Solves  Everything\n\nChain abstraction is a means through which we abstract the blockchain nuances and technical specifics for the average user to deliver a seamless user experience wherein they don’t even know they’re using the blockchain. It can be argued that this breakthrough in UX may be the missing piece from onboarding the next generation of businesses and users to blockchains and crypto-native ecosystems.\n\nDiving into the Components of Chain Abstraction\n\nBefore going over some of the projects building out infrastructure crucial to achieving a chain abstracted future, it’s prudent to go over some of the technological components powering chain abstraction.\n\nAccount Abstraction\n\nToday's wallets face many limitations. Apart from various security vulnerabilities, they only offer limited functionality unless they're used in tandem, i.e. interacting with other smart contracts. What if we reimagined this scenario to transform externally owned accounts (EOAs) into smart contract wallets (SCWs)? Unlike EOAs, SCWs can’t initiate transactions on their own — they require an EOA’s prompt. By merging the capabilities of both, we effectively turn EOAs into SCWs, empowering them to not only initiate transactions but also execute complex, arbitrary logic, the premise of smart contracts.\n\nThis could unlock a plethora of use cases. In this context, we will specifically focus on how this relates to chain abstraction.\n\nWhen you transform an EOA into a SCW, you effectively separate who executes a transaction and who signs it. This means that users don’t directly need to execute transactions but rather have sophisticated actors (called executors) do this on their behalf. It is important to note that during this process the user doesn’t give up the wallet’s custody as the user retains their private key. Having an executor comes with other benefits, like not needing gas balances on all the different blockchains you want to use, as transaction/gas fees can now also be abstracted away. Additionally, users can have bundles of transactions executed at the click of a button. For example, it is possible to approve a token for a DEX, swap it and then lend the proceeds into an Aave market. \n\nHaving an executor eliminates the need to interact with smart contracts directly, all while the user retains custody of user funds. Just imagine using any blockchain application you want through a Telegram bot – this dynamic becomes possible with account abstraction. \n\nFurthermore, account abstraction allows users to self-custody assets and open DeFi positions on many chains without needing different wallets, RPCs, or needing to worry about different signature types, all without even knowing that they’re using a different chain. You can see a demo of this here or continue reading as we cover projects leading exactly these kinds of account abstraction efforts. \n\nThat’s not all – account abstraction also obviates the need for users to hold their own private keys to secure their accounts without being managed by a third party. Users can choose the more traditional means of verification like 2FA and fingerprints in addition to social recovery to secure their wallets. Social recovery allows a lost wallet to be restored through, for example, the user’s family.\n\n \"The next billion users are not going to write 12 words on a piece of paper. Normal people don't do that. We need to give them better usability; they shouldn't need to think about crypto keys.\" - Yoav Weiss, EF\n\nAs wallets are the entry point into crypto and blockchains, account abstraction ultimately enables chain abstraction to blossom.\n\nFor more details on the inner working of account abstraction, refer to this thread by Jarrod Watts. Avocado Wallet by Instadapp is also taking significant strides in leveraging the power of account abstraction for end users. \n\nIntents \n\nIntents enable sophisticated actors or “solvers'' to execute transactions in the most optimal manner on the user’s behalf. It’s in the name – a user expresses their intent to perform an onchain action. A simple definition is expressing, off-chain, their desired on-chain action in the most optimal manner possible. For example, when you submit an order to CowSwap, you’re actually submitting an intent – an intent to swap said token for another, at the best possible price. By submitting this intent off-chain, it bypasses the public mempool and instead is directly routed to an encrypted private mempool where solvers compete to fill, or solve, your intent at the best possible price, either by using their own balance sheets, private orderflow, or using on-chain liquidity venues like Uniswap and Curve. In this way, the solver’s margins compress to zero, giving users the best execution, because there’s always another solver ready to step in to fill this intent.\n\nSo now that we have defined what intents are, how exactly can they help us achieve chain abstraction?\n\nThe answer comes back to delineation between signers and executors in an account abstracted world. If all users need to do is click a button to sign a transaction, they can outsource all their on-chain needs to sophisticated actors, who then take on the responsibility of finding the best execution. The sophisticated actors then bear the risks of interacting with all different applications across L1s and L2s, the associated gas fees in different tokens on different chains, reorganization risks (wherein there are two different versions of the chain), and other execution risks. By taking on these steps and risks, the solvers will price the fees charged to users accordingly. In this situation, users do not need to think about the various complexities and associated risks with using on-chain products and services, which are instead outsourced to sophisticated actors, who price users accordingly. Because of competition between solvers, the fees charged to users will compress to near-zero, as there is always another solver ready to undercut the one winning all the orderflow. It’s the magic of the free market – through the process of competition, users will have better quality services at lower prices. \n\nLet’s explore an example: I have $ETH on Ethereum and want $SOL on Solana and want this executed at the best price. Through a Request for Quote (RFQ) system, the intent marketplace passes on orderflow and in a matter of seconds, the user has $SOL on Solana. Notably, Ethereum has 12 second blocktimes, which means that even though solvers don’t have settlement assurance, by running their own node they can be fairly certain that the $USDC deposit transaction is valid and will go through. Further, by using their own balance sheets solvers can front the $SOL capital on Solana and essentially fulfill the intent before they get their capital. As the risks aren’t borne by users, but rather by the sophisticated actors, users can get their intents fulfilled at sub-second latencies and at the best prices, without knowing the bridges they’re using, the RPCs or the gas costs. \n\nIn this case, users still know which chains they’re using. This example acts to illustrate how intents are working in today’s landscape, not in a completely chain abstracted one. But intents don’t stop there – much more is possible.\n\nIt is easy to envision a future wherein intents work to meet all of the users’ needs. The user simply needs to specify what is to be done and it will be completed in the most efficient way possible. For example, a user may want to borrow $DAI against his/her $ETH and deposit the $DAI into a liquidity pool to earn $CRV rewards. In this example, an authorized solver compares all $DAI borrow rates against $ETH and takes out a loan on the lowest interest rate. The solver then deposits the $DAI in a Yearn-like vault to autocompound the yield from the highest yielding 100% $DAI-denominated LP into $CRV, which streams to the user’s wallet.\n\nHowever, an important caveat: risk is subjective and cannot be expressed in an intent, unlike other objective inputs like maximum price slippage for a trade. So which lending markets, liquidity pools, and chains are used to fulfill this intent? After all, each has different risk profiles and trust assumptions. That’s where the “authorized solvers” come in. Each authorized solver is, to some extent, trusted by the user to carry out the user’s intent with the user’s risk and trust preferences, which are expressed beforehand. For example, a user may specify no depositing into contracts that are “risky”. However, it is likely that only power users will specify a large set of subjective preferences to a network of solvers. Even more sophisticated players than power users (HFTs, MMs, VCs, etc.) will likely interface with the chain(s) directly to avoid any fees from solvers and tailor their risk and trust assumptions themselves. Users with a little understanding of blockchains will likely be able to choose from some set of presets (low, medium, or high risk for example) from which solvers can act upon. \n\nUtilizing a set of authorized solvers for the subjective needs of users enables competitive dynamics between the solvers, which incentivizes the fulfillment of user orders in the best possible manner without any hassle for the user. Furthermore, the fact that the user can “unauthorize” a solver by taking out their executor privileges at any time maintains a system of checks and balances. This way, solvers have an incentive to stay honest and follow the user’s preferences, as otherwise a different solver can prove they were acting maliciously to the user originating the orderflow.\n\nOf course, intents are still a work in progress, and the speculation of how intents can transform into a more sophisticated technology is just that – speculation. However, it would be no surprise to see intents evolve in this manner. We believe intents will play the most instrumental role in materializing a chain abstracted future.\n\nTwo projects tackling intents head-on are CowSwap and deBridge. We have already written about CoWSwap and the intent-based architecture it follows to deliver users a superior UX and execution here. Similar to CoWSwap, deBridge follows an intent-based architecture, but does so to enable lightning-fast cross-chain swaps (trading). DeBridge focuses on seamless UX as it relates to lightning fast trading speeds across chains, minimal fees, and great execution. Like most intent-based solutions, deBridge utilizes a solver network composed of MMs, HFTs, and other sophisticated actors that front capital through their own balance sheet on the destination chain before collecting the user’s capital on the source chain. Apart from having solvers compete with each other to give users the best execution possible, deBridge also differentiates itself by pushing risks, like reorg risks, and other inconveniences, like gas fees and a different RPC on the different involved chains, onto solvers.\n\nThe graphic below illustrates the deBridge model. In the example below, users with USD stablecoin on Solana want EUR stablecoin on Ethereum. They express their intent to the deBridge application, which propagates it to the solver network, allowing solvers, who have $ETH on Ethereum on their balance sheet, to swap their $ETH on Ethereum into $ethEUR, a EUR stablecoin on Ethereum. Soon after deBridge’s validator set verifies that the solver has fulfilled the user’s intent on the destination chain (in this case, give the user $ethEUR), it allows the user’s capital on the source chain (in this case Solana) to be unlocked to the solver. It is important that users don’t need to wait for the verification to happen before receiving their capital on the destination chain.\n\n\nTo better understand deBridge and its intent-based design, we recommend checking out this podcast episode.\n\nLiquidity Aggregation\n\nOne of the symptoms of an increasingly multi-chain future is extreme liquidity fragmentation. This can be hard to aggregate in a cohesive manner. In a world with hundreds of rollups, validiums, L1s, etc., each of which have their own liquidity hosted on their network, the UX gets increasingly worse for end users due to the fragmentation of the liquidity pool. \n\nIf only one centralized exchange (CEX) hosted the entire liquidity of the cryptocurrency markets, instead of the hundreds of CEXs that exist together with even more on-chain DEXs that all share the same pie of liquidity, the execution for end users for would be the best they possibly could be, censorship and overall centralization concerns aside. This is only a hypothetical, however, because this is not feasible in the real world where competition is rife and decentralizing forces exist. \n\nThe advent of DEX aggregators, which aggregate fragmented liquidity sources across a single network into a unified interface, has been an important step for the UX. However, as the inevitable multi-chain future started to play out, DEX aggregators would no longer cut it, as they could only aggregate liquidity on a single chain, not across many or even more than one chain. Furthermore, for blockchains like Ethereum, the associated gas costs required to route liquidity across multiple sources or chains, made the cost of using aggregators greater than that of direct liquidity sources. This model has demonstrated greater success on cheap,  low-latency networks like Solana, though the aggregators themselves are still restricted in the liquidity sources they are able to route trades from.\n\nIn a chain abstracted future, having technology to aggregate fragmented liquidity is crucial, as the ideal user experience will be a chain-agnostic one, and will likely rely on third-party solvers for their execution services. A few solutions that aim to push forward the defragmentation of multi-chain liquidity include Polygon AggLayer and Optimism Superchain. While these are the two that we will be touching on, there are plenty more teams working on such solutions. \n\nPolygon AggLayer\n\nAs the Polygon website states: “The AggLayer will be a decentralized protocol with two components: a common bridge, and the ZK-powered mechanism that provides a cryptographic guarantee of safety for seamless, cross-chain interoperability. With ZK proofs providing security, chains connected to the AggLayer can remain sovereign and modular while preserving the seamless UX of monolithic chains.” \n\nFundamentally, Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solutions, like rollups, have a canonical bridge with Ethereum. This means that all user funds that are bridged from Ethereum to an L2 reside in this bridge contract. However, this disrupts the interoperability among different L2s as well as the ability to seamlessly communicate data and transfer value between them. This is because if you want to, for example, go from Base to Zora (both Ethereum rollups), as seen below, you need to incur a 7 day withdrawal process to go from Base to Ethereum using the canonical Base bridge and then use the canonical Zora bridge to go from Ethereum to Zora. This is because, for optimistic rollups like Base, the time is needed to dispute the bridging transaction using a fault/fraud proof. Apart from the fact that this is a lengthy process, it is also expensive because you need to interact with the Ethereum main chain. \n\nPolygon’s AggLayer flips this process on its head. Instead of having a canonical bridge to Ethereum, where only one particular rollup user’s non-native assets sit, all chains share a bridge contract with other chains utilizing the AggLayer to have this hub of liquidity, as seen below. Through this process, developers will now be able to connect their chain to the AggLayer to allow users to enjoy unified liquidity.\n\n\n\n\nHow AggLayer Works \n\nAt its core, the AggLayer aggregates zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs from all the chains connected to it – this allows it to facilitate cross-chain transactions. The AggLayer is essentially a place where all its supported chains post ZK proofs to show that some action has taken place. For example, that 5 $USDC from Base has been withdrawn in order to unlock liquidity on some other side, like Zora. \n\nTo further illustrate this, consider how it works in practice. In this example, we are assuming all named chains are connected to the AggLayer.\n\nA solver detects a request, or intent, from a user who resides on Base. The user has $ETH and wants to purchase an NFT on Zora that costs 3000 $DAI. Since the solver doesn’t have $DAI on their balance sheet, they must quickly look for the best route to fulfill this intent. They realize that $DAI on Optimism is cheaper than market $DAI on Zora. Hence, the solver posts a proof to the AggLayer showing that the user has the $ETH on Base and wants a commensurate amount of $ETH on Optimism. Given that the bridge contract is shared, a ZK proof is all it takes to move said fungible asset residing on chain “X” in the same quantity to chain “Y”.\n\nAfter posting the ZK proof and unlocking a commensurate amount of $ETH on Optimism, the solver then swaps into $DAI and does the same process to get the same amount of $DAI on Zora to then finish buying the NFT. Behind the scenes, the AggLayer also settles these ZK proofs to Ethereum for stronger security guarantees for end-users and AggLayer-connected chains.\n\nHowever, in this case, the solver/user/other actor bears inventory risk. This comes in the form of the $DAI rate on Optimism being arbitraged, the cost of the NFT rising, the price of $ETH dropping, or any other risk between the time that the orderflow from the user is originated and filled, subsequently incurring losses to the respective party. Unlike DEX aggregators on a single chain, which have atomic composability, solvers that interact with different state machines aren’t privy to this same atomic composability. Atomic composability ensures that all operations are executed in a single, linear sequence and either all succeed or all fail together. This is because between different state machines always need at least a one block delay due to the potential risks of reorgs (on the destination chain). \n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean that the aforementioned use cases are not possible. There are not only long-tail events but also solvers and other sophisticated actors that can take on these risks and compensate for them by pricing them to users. For example, the solver can guarantee execution by covering the losses if they so occur or by filling the user’s intents using their own balance sheets.\n\nOptimism Superchain\n\nAnother example of aggregation liquidity is the Optimism Superchain initiative. The Superchain, defined by the Optimism documentation is “a network of chains that share bridging, decentralized governance, upgrades, a communication layer and more – all built on the OP Stack.” The project focuses on aggregating liquidity, similar to AggLayer. Optimism Superchain will have all chains that are a part of the Superchain utilize a shared bridge contract. This is the first step in having aggregated liquidity between chains in the Superchain. \n\nThe difference between the Superchain and the AggLayer is that the AggLayer relies on ZK-proofs for seamless, whereas the Superchain relies on a shared sequencer between chains opting into the Superchain. While this post won’t get into the details of shared sequencing, you can refer to this to understand how shared sequencing unlocks benefits in the realm of seamless cross-chain interoperability and, to some extent, atomic composability (the same problems elucidated above with cross-chain atomic composability apply here too). \n\nBecause the Superchain mandates that chains opting in have to use the shared sequencer, it could limit the execution environments that can be used for chains opting into the Superchain.  Other cumbersome challenges arise, such as having the chains lose access to the MEV their users create, in addition to other challenges outlined here. However, teams like Espresso are working on ways to redistribute MEV enabled by chains utilizing a shared sequencer. Furthermore, all chains connected to the Polygon AggLayer (and hence post ZK proofs to this AggLayer) need to use the same ZK circuits which could also limit the execution environments that can be used for chains connected to the AggLayer. \n\nChain Abstraction is a Piece of CAKE \n\nFrontier Research has developed the CAKE (Chain Abstraction Key Elements) framework, which can be seen above. This outlines the three layers (excluding the user-facing application layer) required to reach a state where:\n\n“In a chain abstracted world, a user goes to a dApp’s website, connects their wallet, signs the intended operation and waits for eventual settlement. All the complexity of acquiring the required assets to the target chain and the final settlement gets abstracted away from the user, happening in [the three] infrastructure layers of the CAKE.”\n\nThe framework identifies the three infrastructure layers of the CAKE as the permission layer, the solver layer, and the settlement layer. We have mostly touched on the solver and permission layers. The permission layer consists of account abstraction and policies - authorization as we’ve called it - and the settlement layer, which includes low-level technology like oracles, bridges, pre-confirmations, and other back-end features.\n\nAs such, the settlement layer is expected to be greatly beneficial for solvers and other sophisticated actors and user-facing applications, as components of settlement in this framework all work together to help solvers manage their risk and provide better execution for users. This further extends into other components like data availability and execution proofs. These are all requirements for chains to provide a safe building experience for application developers and provide security guarantees which are eventually passed onto end-users.\n\nThe CAKE framework encompasses many of the concepts mentioned in this post and provides a coherent way of looking at the various components of chain abstraction and their relation to each other. Those interested in the framework can read this introductory article. \n\nCase Studies for Chain Abstraction\n\nWhile we’ve already touched on a few projects spearheading the effort towards a chain abstracted future, here are a few other notable projects that are doing the same. \n\nParticle Network\n\nParticle Network is launching a modular L1 blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK, which will operate as a high-performance EVM-compatible execution environment. Originally, Particle debuted as an account abstraction service provider, enabling users to create smart contract wallets linked to their Web2 social accounts to then be used natively within dApp-embedded interfaces. Since then, the protocol has expanded its offerings, aiming to proliferate chain abstraction across the broader blockchain landscape through a suite of wallet, liquidity, and gas abstraction services on its L1. \n\nSimilar to other chain abstraction service providers, Particle envisions a future in which anyone will be able to easily transact across multiple chains through a single account, paying gas fees in any token they wish. As such, the underlying L1 will serve as a coordinator for the multi-chain ecosystem, unifying users and liquidity across EVM and non-EVM domains alike.\n\nLet’s see how it works. \n\nThe Particle Chain Abstraction Stack \n\nParticle offers a multi-faceted toolkit for chain abstraction services, each core technology playing a unique role as part of a greater whole. \n\nUniversal Accounts \n\nFrom the perspective of an end-user, Particle’s chain abstraction stack starts with first principles - creating an account. Universal Accounts on Particle function as ERC-4337 smart accounts attached to a pre-existing EOA (externally owned address), aggregating token balances across multiple chains into a single address by automatically routing and executing atomic cross-chain transactions. While a traditional crypto wallet can be used to create and manage an account, Particle’s WaaS enables users to use social logins for onboarding as well. \n\nTo abstract away various complexities of blockchain-native operations, a UA functions as a unified interface built on top of existing wallets, allowing users to deposit and use tokens across multiple blockchain environments as if it existed on a single chain. To maintain a synchronous state across UAs, account settings are stored on the Particle L1 to be used as a central source of truth across every instance. The network will then facilitate cross-chain messaging to either deploy a new instance(s) or update existing ones. \n\nAs such, the Particle L1 acts as a coordination and settlement layer for all cross-chain transactions processed through Particle’s UAs. \n\nUniversal Liquidity \n\nAnother key component of Particle’s chain abstraction services is the Universal Liquidity functionality. While UAs provide a means for users to express their transactional request through an interface, Universal Liquidity refers to the layer responsible for the automatic execution of these requests, which in turn enables a unification of balances across different networks. This feature is key to enabling cross-chain transfers which would otherwise be hindered by current barriers to entry, like purchasing the native gas token and creating a native wallet for a new network.\n\nFor instance, when a user wishes to purchase an asset on a blockchain they have never used before and don’t have any funds on, the liquidity needed for this purchase is automatically sourced from a user’s existing balances, which may likely be on a different chain and a different token. This is largely made possible through Particle’s Decentralized Messaging Network (DMN), which enables specialized services, known as Relayer Nodes, to monitor external chain events and the settlement of state events. To be more exact, relayers in the DMN use a Messaging Protocol for monitoring the status of UserOperations on external chains and then settling the final execution status to the Particle L1.\n\nUniversal Gas \n\nThe third pillar of Particle’s chain abstraction stack is the implementation of a Universal Gas Token - part of the network’s gas abstraction service. Accessed by interacting with Particle’s UAs, Universal Gas allows users to spend any token to pay for gas fees, meaning Bob can pay a transaction fee for a swap on Solana using his USDC on Base, while Alice pays a transaction fee for purchasing an NFT on Ethereum using her ARB token on Arbitrum. \n\nWhen a user wishes to execute a transaction through a Particle UA, the interface will prompt the user to select their gas token of choice, which is then automatically routed through Particle’s native Paymaster contract. All gas payments are settled to their respective source and destination chains, while a portion of the fee is swapped into Particle’s native $PARTI token to be settled on the Particle L1. \n\nRoadmap \n\nParticle builds on top of its existing account abstraction infrastructure, for which it has reported over 17m wallet activations and over 10m UserOperations to day. The addition of a Universal Liquidity layer, coupled with a Universal Gas token, aims to mark Particle’s expansion into providing chain abstraction services across a broader spectrum of users and participants. The Particle L1 is not meant to be another blockchain directly competing with today’s incumbents; rather it seeks to provide an interoperability layer to connect them all instead, working with key teams in the chain abstraction services sector, including the Near and Cake R&D teams. \n\nThe Particle Network L1 is currently in its testnet phase, allowing early participants to try out Universal Gas within an experimental UA implementation\n\nNear Protocol\n\nNear is a sharded Proof-of-Stake Layer 1 blockchain that serves as an full-stack application domain for developers building decentralized products and services. Much of Near’s core ethos revolves around bridging the gap between blockchain-native applications and mainstream audiences. A key to fulfilling this vision is abstracting away the blockchain from the end-user. Near approaches this with Account Aggregation - a multi-faceted architecture built to abstract away key pain points of using blockchain networks such as switching wallets, managing gas fees, bridging. It accomplishes this by funneling all operations to be run through a single account. \n\nLet’s dive deeper to better understand how this all works. \n\nThe Near Chain Abstraction Stack \nNear Accounts \n\nIn addition to the alphanumeric public key hash standard on most blockchains today, Near’s proprietary account model enables each account to be mapped to a human-readable account name, i.e. alice.near. Near accounts also utilize two types of access keys which are distinct in their nature and underlying functions, enabling accounts to be able to manage multiple keys across multiple blockchains, each key accounting for the various permissions and configurations that are unique to its domain:\n\nFull-Access Keys: These can be used to sign transactions doing virtually action on an account's behalf and should therefore never be shared. \n\nFunction-Call Keys: These keys are granted permissions to sign calls exclusively to a specific contract or set of contracts. \n\nFurther bolstering the abstraction of blockchains to the end-user is a simplified onboarding process with FastAuth, Near’s proprietary key management system. FastAuth enables users to sign up for a blockchain-native account with something as simple as their email address and uses passkeys, which replace passwords with biometrics, in place of long and complex seed phrases and passwords.  \n\nChain Signatures\n\nMulti-chain signatures are a key component of Near's abstraction of blockchains, allowing any NEAR account to have associated remote addresses on other chains and to sign messages and execute transactions from those addresses. To enable this, Chain Signatures use the NEAR MPC (multi-party computation) network as the signer for these remote addresses, eliminating the need for explicit private keys. This is enabled by a novel threshold signature protocol, which implements a form of key resharing that allows the MPC signer to maintain the same aggregate public key, even as key shares and nodes constantly change. \n\nMaking MPC signer nodes also part of the NEAR network allows smart contracts to start the signing process for an account. By using different combinations of a chain ID, a NEAR account ID, and a specific path, each account can create an unlimited number of remote addresses on any chain.\n\nMeta Transactions \n\nAnother key issue hindering the development of a seamless user experience across the universal blockchain landscape today is that each blockchain requires gas fees to be paid in its own native token, requiring users to acquire these tokens prior to being able to use the underlying network. \n\nNEP-366 introduced meta transactions to Near, a feature which allows for the execution of transactions on Near without owning any gas or tokens on the chain. This is made possible through Relayers, a third-party service provider which receives signed transactions and relays them to the network while attaching the tokens necessary to subsidize their gas fees. From a technical perspective, the end user creates and signs a SignedDelegateAction, which contains the data necessary to construct a Transaction, and sends it to the relayer service. The relayer signs a Transaction using this data, sends the SignedTransaction to the network via RPC call, and ensures the relayer pays the gas fees while the actions are executed on the user’s behalf.\n\nTo better illustrate what this may look like in practice, consider the following example: Alice wants to send Bob some of her $ALICE tokens, but lacks $NEAR tokens needed to cover gas fees. By using meta transactions, she creates a DelegateAction, signs it, and sends it to a relayer. The relayer, who pays the gas fees, wraps it in a transaction and forwards it on-chain, allowing the transfer to be completed successfully.\n\nRoadmap \n\nThe key to a successful implementation of a seamless user experience across multiple blockchain networks is the integration and support of those blockchains, even if they are competing businesses. Though Near functions as a competitive business of its own, their growth strategy revolves around growing the industry as a whole, granting their users access to many other blockchains in a seamless and secure manner.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nHere are some other teams building solutions for chain abstraction services worth keeping an eye on – this list is not necessarily exhaustive but instead provides a foundation for those interested in conducting further research into chain abstraction models.\n\nConnext\n\nConnext is a modular interoperability protocol which defined chain abstraction in their blog (May 2023) as a “pattern to improve dApp user experience by minimizing the need for users to care about the chain they’re on,” which accurately depicts the core principle chain abstraction service providers are building around today. Though Connext offers a set of smart contract modules for application developers through its Chain Abstraction Toolkit, its core feature is xCall, a primitive which enables smart contracts to interact with one another across different environments. The xCall function initiates a cross-chain transfer of funds, calldata, and/or various named properties, which the Chain Abstraction Toolkit wraps in simple logic for developers to utilize. From a developer perspective, this implies a relatively simple process:\n\nWrite an adapter for the function they wish to abstract.\n\nDeploy the necessary modules for the chains they wish to integrate.\n\nCall the function directly from their UI.\n\nSocket Protocol\n\nSocket provides infrastructure for application developers building interoperability-centric products and services with secure and efficient data and asset transfers across chains. Socket 2.0 marks a shift for the protocol from cross-chain to chain abstraction services, highlighted by its flagship Modular Order Flow Auction (MOFA) mechanism, which aims to enable a competitive mechanism for efficient chain abstracted markets. Traditional OFAs involve a network of various actors performing specialized tasks that compete to deliver the best possible outcome for an end-user request. Similarly, MOFA is designed to provide an open marketplace for execution agents, called Transmitters, and user intents. Within the MOFA, Transmitters compete to create and fulfill chain abstracted bundles, or ordered sequences of user-requests which require transfer of data and value across multiple blockchains. \n\nInfinex\n\nInfinex is building a single UX layer aimed at unifying decentralized applications and ecosystems. Its flagship product, Infinex Account, is a multi-layered service that functions as a platform for integrating any on-chain application into a simplified UX for the end-user. At its core, the Infinex Account is a set of cross-chain smart contracts that can be controlled, secured and recovered via standard web2 authentication.\n\nBrahma Console\n\nBrahma Finance is building its flagship Console product, an on-chain execution and custody environment aimed at enhancing user experience across DeFi, focusing specifically on the EVM blockchain ecosystem. Brahma uses batched and chained transactions to synchronize transactions across different chains, and Smart Accounts for interacting on-chain. The end result will reflect a user experience which enables seamless cross-chain interactions within a single UI.\n\nAgoric\n\nAgoric is a Cosmos-native Layer 1 blockchain for building cross-chain smart contracts in JavaScript. The Agoric platform is designed with an asynchronous, multi-block execution environment, and aims to be the go-to environment for developing cross-chain applications. Agoric utilizes the Cosmos InterBlockchain Communication (IBC) Protocol for interchain communications, while leveraging Axelar’s General Message Passing (GMP) for interactions beyond the Cosmos ecosystem. Agoric’s Orchestration API simplifies developer experience by abstracting the complexities involved in cross-chain communication and smart contract execution, while the end-user benefits from applications with inherent chain abstracted features. \n\nClosing Thoughts\n\nBy now, the advantages that chain abstraction unlock for end-users should be clear - the complexities of using blockchain-native applications are entirely abstracted away into a unified interface layer, creating a global and chain-agnostic point of contact for anyone who wants to participate. \n\nEqually as importantly, chain abstraction could unlock a huge benefit for blockchain applications. Currently, Web2 developers don’t “choose” where to deploy their application. For instance, Airbnb is available for anyone with an internet connection. However, in the Web3 landscape application developers need to choose where to deploy their application (for example, on Ethereum, Solana or Cosmos). Not only does this limit TAM, but also means that application developers are encumbered by needing to choose the “right” chain to deploy their application on. This is not only a hard decision to make but a crucial one. There have been a handful of applications that were extremely successful but struggled due to the underlying blockchain. Furthermore, with the continuous development and evolution of blockchains today, the “right” chain may constantly be changing. In a chain abstracted future, application developers are no longer encumbered by having to select a chain that their success is tied to.\n\nIt is evident that we are headed towards an increasingly multichain future. This inevitably will only compound UX issues that are one of the most critical barriers to mainstream adoption. We believe chain abstraction, with its various components, is a possible solution to many of crypto’s UX problems  today.\n\nReferences\n\nAkdeniz, M. (2024, February 5).

As users increasingly seek more financial flexibility, these trends present unique opportunities to leverage emerging technology to fulfill these needs.\n\nOver the last year, \"intents\" — user expressions for a desired goal — have sparked a wave of innovations across networks and applications, simplifying complex tasks such as trades and other on-chain actions. Intents abstract away the intricacies involved in on-chain operations, making decentralized finance (DeFi) more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nSubscribe\n\nThe meteoric rise in adoption of technologies like ChatGPT, a powerful large language model, adds a new tool for user complexity abstraction. These advancements offer revitalizing opportunities for protocols to couple user intents with LLMs like GPT, enhancing the user experience through natural language processing and contextual understanding. At the intersection of these technologies lies a unique opportunity to transform DeFi user experience (UX) as we know it today.\n\nState of DeFi UX Today \n\nUser Experience: Web3’s Achilles Heel\n\nThe rapid development of technology over the past several decades has brought about unprecedented shifts in efficiency and performance in people’s everyday lives. In today’s increasingly consumer-centric world, user experience can make or break a business. Prioritizing user experience is therefore crucial for the long-term success of businesses across virtually all domains today. A seamless and pleasant user experience not only attracts users but retains them over time. These are the kind of products and services people enjoy using because of their design and interaction elements, regardless of their essential function. On the other hand, a poor user experience will inevitably steer users away to a similar product or service which functions more efficiently. \n\nDecentralized finance (DeFi) applications have failed to gain traction outside of a relatively concentrated portion of crypto-native users, primarily due to a long history of poor user experience. DeFi imposes a myriad of security and financial risks, with unsuspecting retail users often bearing the brunt of these consequences. Today, a single misstep when conducting transactions on-chain can lead to unexpected financial losses. One of the common security issues arises from users inadvertently clicking on fraudulent links or falling victim to phishing scams. These malicious attacks trick individuals into connecting their wallets to harmful programs while performing routine tasks like claiming an eligible airdrop. \n\nConversely, many of the financial risks in DeFi are often obfuscated by technical complexities which are poorly communicated to users, emerging during activities such as rebalancing weighted portfolios or a position in a liquidity pool. Sophisticated entities engage in value extraction tactics like frontrunning or sandwich attacks to exploit trades, resulting in poor execution outcomes for end-users. Additionally, transacting across various blockchains using third-party bridges introduces another layer of risk; with reported hacks causing over $2.8 billion worth of stolen assets highlighting this vulnerability issue within DeFi systems.\n\nThe rise of LLMs like Chat-GPT have introduced new consumer-facing solutions to help automate many tedious and complex tasks, from making grocery lists to lecture plans for teachers. This technology ultimately stands to improve many quality-of-life aspects of people’s everyday lives. Therefore, considering the poor state of DeFi UX today, we ask - why should navigating DeFi be any different from typing a prompt into chatGPT?\n\nIt’s The Intent That Counts \n\nTo formally define an intent;\n\n“Signed messages which allow for a set of state transitions from a given starting state, a special case of which is a transaction which allows for a unique transition.” - Paradigm \n\nAn intent is an abstract operation description of a user’s desired outcome from an on-chain interaction, i.e., the execution of a transaction which purchases asset X at price Y, which delegates the execution to smart contracts or third parties for enhanced user experience. \n\nAn intent goes beyond a mere transaction request, however; it's a holistic representation of the user's desired outcome on the blockchain. It comprises 4 key facets: \n\nDomain: Where the intent executes.\n\nObjective: The user's articulated goal.\n\nConstraints: Conditions for successful execution.\n\nPreferences: User-specified priorities or processing options.\n\nAre all intents equal? \nThe short answer is no. \n\nFor starters, protocols may choose to implement different types of intents using different methods. Our previous article, MEV Protection: DEX & Aggregator Anti-MEV Mechanisms outlines how DEX aggregators like CoW Swap and 1inch might lead users to the same outcome, that is to swap token A -> token B, though they use different algorithms and intent-based models to perform the desired action. \n\nIntents can be very app-specific, i.e. an application which restricts intents to perform a specific function, such as performing a DEX swap, or they can be more generalized in which they serve as a framework for building applications on top of. They can be constrained to a specific domain which they are specialized in, or they can function across multiple domains to capture a larger base of users. \n\nThe Intents Infrastructure Landscape Today\nFigure 1. Intent Landscape. Source. Delphi Digital.\nAnoma \n\nAnoma Network is building the “universal intent machine on Ethereum”, to proliferate the development of intent-centric applications. Key to Anoma’s composability is that intents and applications written with Anoma can be ordered, solved, and settled anywhere - on Ethereum, on EVM and non-EVM rollups, on Eigenlayer AVSs, on Cosmos chains, Solana, and any sufficiently programmable state machine.\n\nUsers express intents, which must be created by the user interfaces, understood by intent gossip nodes, matched by Solvers, and validated by the application’s validity predicates. \n\nSolver algorithms instruct a solver how to match an application’s intents and form valid transactions. Anoma user interfaces present a graphical or textual view of and controller for the application in question.\n\nSuave (Single Unifying Auction for Value Expression)\n\nFlashbots is building SUAVE, a modular blockchain network which offers an easily-adaptable mempool and decentralized block builder for any blockchain. Its key value proposition lies in the separation of the mempool and block builder roles from existing chains to offer a highly specialized plug-and-play alternative.\n\nAt the core of SUAVE are intents, or ‘preferences’, which are the native transaction type on SUAVE. They can either contain a payload instructing a specific blockchain to be executed on, or instead leave the optimal routing to the Solvers, referred to as ‘executors’. Once a user has submitted their intent, it is passed to the Execution Market, in which executors compete in an auction to provide users with the best execution possible. Finally, a decentralized block building network gathers the collected preferences and turns them into blocks across all supported blockchains. The decentralized block-building market maximizes MEV for builders and validators while allowing the builder itself to become decentralized.\n\nEssential\n\nEssential is building the first declarative blockchain, that is, a blockchain which leverages constraints to achieve state updates without the need for execution. At a high level, Essential is an intent-centric layer-2 blockchain, deployed as an optimistic rollup on Ethereum. Optimizing for state updates without execution means that no state transition may be included if it does not satisfy the user’s intent. In other words, users get what they want or they get nothing at all. This approach aims to bypass a common bottleneck in today’s blockchains which leads to various performance issues and irregular spikes in transaction costs. \n\nUser intents submitted to the Essential network declaratively outline a set of variables, as well as constraints on those variables, narrowing down the set of feasible execution routes. Users can also specify an objective utility function to represent their preferences and preference ordering. Solvers then attempt to maximize the user’s request with respect to their objective function. \n\nTradeoffs with Intents Today \nTrust Assumptions for Solvers \n\nUsers cannot choose where the intents settle themselves. This means intents may be settled on any blockchain or even a centralized server. Solvers are in charge of executing the intents of the user, a key design in abstracting away friction in the user experience. However, this delegation of execution rights adds a new layer of trust assumptions in the overall process, wherein the user must now trust that the Solvers is acting in their best interest, though Solvers may choose to utilize off-chain resources (i.e personal inventory held on a CEX) which reduce the overall transparency of the protocol. More broadly, this has raised questions about the necessity of these new layers, a common criticism being that introducing new middlemen only hurts the user over time, whether due to additional incurred service fees, malintent on Solvers’ behalf (i.e. colluding with block builders for MEV operations), and the centralization forces which may arise due to restrictive barriers to entry for running Solvers. \n\nDoes DeFi really need more middlemen? (c/o Orderflow.art) \n\nThat said, though Solvers are often centralized entities today, i.e. market maker firms, the emergence of decentralized models such as PropellerSolver presents a compelling opportunity moving forward. PropellerSolver itself is an advanced network of swap Solvers – across EVM and non-EVM chains - which accesses a wide network of liquidity sources, including market makers and protocol-native paths, to secure competitive prices for trades across EVM and non-EVM chains. It uses a custom routing algorithm and gas-optimized contracts to find the most optimal liquidity routes on users’ behalf, and uses private transaction routing to offer MEV-protection for users. \n\nSingle-Use Functionality \n\nAnother key limitation which arises is that intents are still constrained in their functions, as they are designed to be executed at a single point in time. This poses a challenge to the efficient fulfillment of various on-chain operations, such as managing an LP position over a specific period of time, or executing a trade without losing money due to being front run or sandwiched. \n\nMerging AI and Intents\n\nAI presents a unique application for streamlining end users' intents. By leveraging intents, protocols can handle multistep intent criteria and fill input requirements using a chatbox interface. This means that users can explain their desires in plain language, and the flexible interface can capture multistep intents and process them to Solvers. The more complex an intent-based application or protocol is, the more time it may take to fulfill the minimum requirements to execute the intent. In theory, the process of intent declaration can be fluid, while the nuances and specifications are worked out using machine learning data, which are then passed on to the Solver. Intents in other spoken languages are trivial, as machine learning can properly translate the desired outcome to Solvers.\n\nIntent Data Collection and Refining Intents\n\nPossible intent outcomes are generally constrained by UX limitations created by the protocol, where the user can perform only designated operations. If a specified intent outcome does not exist, protocols may leverage LLM input data to refine the intent path at a later date, essentially creating a product feedback loop. Similar to how LLM models train and improve based on inputs, intent data can be used to refine users' intents.\n\nFor example, let's say a DEX uses intent-based swaps leveraging a chatbot. The LLM operator notices an increased number of exotic requests to open a long position on a perps DEX after a swap. This request data can be used to iterate on the intent paths and prompting to improve the UX.\n\nCase Study: Aperture Finance\n\nAperture Finance is a DeFi protocol offering liquidity management services, which aims to transform the state of DeFi UX by building an intent based protocol with a GPT-like chatbox UX, enabling users to state their goals in natural language. A network of third-party participants, called Solvers, will then execute requests on behalf of users. Solvers are in charge of optimizing the process, allowing the intent/request to be processed efficiently and at a low cost. Aperture acts as a general-purpose DeFi protocol with a range of practical applications. \n\nAperture’s Architecture \n\nFrom a technical perspective, Aperture is building a novel Layer 2 that accommodates intents on both Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and non-EVM chains by taking advantage of the latest advances in LLMs.\n\nFigure 2. Aperture’s System Architecture\n\nThere are four key actors in Aperture’s architecture:\n\n\nOrchestrator: The orchestrator efficiently disseminates and processes user intents. This includes the intent mempool, the blockchain storage layer, and the execution environment where the smart contracts derived from user intents are executed.\n\nSolver: The Solver provides solutions in exchange for economic incentives from the intent poster. Solvers handle the system's complexity. They can be public and transparent Solvers, processing standard intents in a transparent manner suitable for general transactions. Alternatively, they could be privileged Solvers, handling privacy-sensitive intents with special trust credentials. \n\nSequencer: Sequencers are tasked with ordering and processing intents on Aperture’s L2 chain. Then compressing the processed intents and transactions and pushing them to the designated Layer 1.\n\nFulfiller: The fulfiller is responsible for pushing the solutions devised by Solvers to the target chain and monitoring their execution status. Their role is to ensure that the Solver properly solves intents. \n\nIntent Lifecycle on Aperture \n\nThe flow of an intent on Aperture, from the end-user to the designated blockchain starts with users defining their intents and submitting them for processing by solvers. The intents are then processed with privacy mechanisms like zero-knowledge proofs, verified with trust scoring and ZKPs, and finally fulfilled with oversight from the Fulfiller to ensure secure and reliable transaction execution.\n\nIntent Definition -  The user defines their intent, including the domain, objective, constraints, and preferences for the desired outcome within the blockchain environment, i.e. ‘Buy 10 ETH at a price of $3000 per token on Arbitrum’. \n\nIntent Submission - The intents are submitted to a network of Solvers, responsible for processing and fulfillment of the intents. The Solver then submits the intent, solution, and corresponding proof to the Intent Mempool for storage. \n\nIntent Processing - Intents in the Intent Mempool are then processed via ZK-Processor to ensure privacy and security are maintained, and that user intents are executed faithfully and in alignment with predefined end-state criteria.\n\nSolution Verification - The ZK Processor then generates Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for historical on-chain data to validate Solvers' outputs without revealing confidential data. This is later used as input for Aperture’s Dynamic Trust Scoring methodology, which assigns trust scores to Solvers based on historical performance and adherence to network protocols. \n\nSolution Fulfillment - The Fulfiller is then responsible for pushing the solutions devised by intent Solvers to the target chain and monitoring their execution status, enforcing accountability and penalizing any malicious behavior. \n\nThe Aperture Intents DSL \n\nKey to Aperture’s value proposition is the ability for users to articulate their transactional goals and preferences with greater ease. Modern LLMs utilize natural language processing to interpret user prompts and emit an appropriate output based on its training data. Given that imperative blockchain architectures do not natively support the processing of intents, the need for interpretive solutions arises. \n\nAperture utilizes a proprietary intents-centric programming language, the Intents DSL, to enhance the expressibility of user Intents. A Domain Specific Language, or DSL, refers to a programming language specialized to a particular application domain, tailored to fulfill specific tasks. Common examples include SQL, HTML, CSS, to name a few. The purpose of these specialized languages is to enable the expression of logic within a specific domain in a more efficient manner than existing solutions, thereby enhancing the overall developer experience, and consequently the user experience of the applications built on top of said DSL. \n\nAperture’s Intents DSL enables users to express their intent using natural language, which gets then interpreted and processed into logic which expresses the fulfillment of that intent as an event on the blockchain. The Intent Interface, the chatbot-like frontend through which the user interacts, facilitates the entire process to 1) translate and mirror the intent back to user to be verified, and 2) interpret and deliver the intent as a valid expression of onchain logic to the Intent Clearing House, the following layer involved in the fulfillment of an intent. \n\nTo further illustrate this concept, consider an example of what a user ‘conversation’ may look like;\n\nUser Input - “Rebalance my ETH-USDC positions on Arbitrum and Base so that ¾ of my funds are in the top-performing pools and the remaining ¼ are distributed evenly across any other pools.”\n\nUI - “Sure, here are the details of your request: \n\nEligible Assets: ETH-GMX pairs on Mainnet, Arbitrum, and Avalanche\n\nPermitted Actions: Bridge, Remove liquidity, Swap ETH or GMX, Add Liquidity\n\nPrimary Objective: Reallocate 80% of eligible asset capital to the pool with the highest spot APR according to data from APY Vision.\n\nSecondary Objective: Distribute the remaining 20% of eligible asset capital evenly across the other pools not included in the primary objective.\n\nConfirmation: Sign Intent declaration if correct.” \n\nAt this point, the user confirms the DSL interpretation is valid by signing the intent to be submitted to the clearing house. \n\nIntents Clearing House \n\nFunctioning similarly to the public mempool on Ethereum, the Intents Clearing House serves as a waiting room for intents. This stage is responsible for organizing these intents to be  processed and fulfilled on the designated blockchain, ranking intents and their corresponding solutions by quality of execution on user’s behalf, as well as accounting for any additional  conditional requirements, i.e. time-sensitive orders. The fulfillment of user intents is enforced onchain through the use of Verification Smart Contracts, wherein each type of intent use case will require a smart contract to simulate, verify, and police the proposed solution.\n\nThe Use of ZKPs in The Aperture Protocol \n\nThrough a partnership with Brevis, a novel ZK coprocessor, Aperture introduces an autonomous, intent-centric framework that allows users to specify intentions over an extended period, reacting to specific conditions, addressing a common limitation discussed earlier, wherein user intents can only be expressed at a single point in time. For instance, with Brevis, users can set an instruction to rebalance an ETH-USDC Uniswap V3 position when there is 15% price movement, continuing until they decide to stop.\n\nMaintaining Solver Integrity \n\nIn addition to extending the functionality of intents, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are also employed to enforce protocol standards. Aperture maintains the integrity of its Solvers by employing a dynamic trust scoring system to evaluate Solvers based on their historical performance and accuracy. This is enabled through the use of the Brevis ZK coprocessor, which enables smart contracts to access and use full historical on-chain data from any blockchain to validate the accuracy of solutions without exposing private data. \n\nUse Cases & Applications \n\nData from Aperture’s Intents dashboard indicate that the protocol has handled over $2.3b in Intents volume, spanning across over 2.7m intents in total. Looking closer by intent type, the most common intents today revolve around rebalancing, that is, redistributing assets in a liquidity pool to optimize performance which can be based on predefined criteria, and reinvesting, or reallocating any earned fees or rewards back into the liquidity pool to maximize returns. \n\nAutomated Liquidity Management \n\nFirst, consider Liquidity Managers or Automated Liquidity Managers (ALM). That is, protocols that actively manage liquidity pool positions on users’ behalf. Concentrated liquidity market makers (CLMMs) like Uniswap V3 offer extensive flexibility in liquidity provision but are more complex for users, increasing Impermanent Loss (IL) risk when providing liquidity within narrow price ranges. Aperture has already built out a suite of liquidity management tools, offering automated position rebalancing, automated position closure based on pricing, pool ratio, and time and auto-compounding of fees. For instance, in an ETH/USDC pool, the LP position could be rebalanced with every 5% price movement to minimize IL. After 3 months, the strategy can be exited by swapping all capital to USDC.\n\nWith the advent of Aperture’s AI-powered intents, users can express how they would like to customize and set up their LP position strategy using natural language, mitigating risks around performance after implementation. Today, the Total Value Locked (TVL) on ALMs on all different chains is $584m, presenting a compelling opportunity to enhance the performance of a service which has been proven its product-market fit in the broader DeFi landscape, using AI-powered intents. \n\nClaiming an Eligible Airdrop \n\nAirdrops enable blockchain protocols to distribute their native tokens to addresses which have met required criteria, typically aligning with the interests of community members and early adopters. However, a common issue which arises during these events is an abundance of malicious links which get sent around by actors impersonating team or team member accounts, targeting unsuspecting users to connect their wallets to then be drained.\n\n Aperture’s intent-centric architecture enables users to avoid these risks while easily expressing their request through natural language. To further illustrate, let’s consider a user who wishes to claim all of their eligible airdrops across several different chains they have been proactively using. To start, they would type “Claim all eligible airdrops on my behalf across Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism” into the Aperture chatbot-UX, which processes and submits the request to be fulfilled by the Solver network. Any Solver which comes across the request can now view the user’s provided wallet address and cross-reference it with any claimable airdrops or rewards that are eligible for said address, ensuring that only the appropriate links and contract addresses are accessed. The proposed solutions would then be simulated by Aperture’s smart contract to verify the proposed outcome, and subsequently all verified solutions would be ranked and executed on the user’s behalf. Users receive the tokens they are eligible for in their designated wallet, without needing to stress about the verification of links and social media profiles. \n\nMEV-Protection \n\nMaximal Extracted Value (MEV) is captured by validators within a network through reorganizing transactions in a new block, including or excluding them during block production. MEV capture comes in the form of CDP-position liquidations or arbitrage, though the former occurs much more frequently. \n\nA particularly common malicious arbitrage strategy is sandwiching. In this scenario, a sophisticated entity may observe a significant token purchase waiting to be executed as a pending transaction in the public mempool. Using specialized software known as a MEV-bot, they can then place a buy order to be executed before that large order and a sell order immediately after, ensuring priority block inclusion by paying a higher validator tip. By doing so, the MEV-bot is effectively engaging in both frontrunning and backrunning, respectively, of the transaction. \n\nRoughly 5% to 10% of all DEX volumes are sandwiched on the Ethereum mainnet, according to Hildobby from DragonFly Ventures. \n\nJust in the past 7 days, $41 billion was traded on DeFi (DeFiLlama).\n\nSince solvers are sophisticated actors, we expect them to implement MEV protection tools such as private transaction routing, order batching, and the utilization of off-chain capital to ensure users receive the lowest competitive price on their desired trade. \n\nFuture Outlook - AI Enhances DeFi UX\n\nAs digital asset adoption continues to soar, driven by global economic shifts, AI holds the promise to refine user intents continuously while also guiding users in formulating better, more precise intents. The integration of AI with user intents allows for significant UX improvements and valuable data collection, further optimizing DeFi protocols. In the future,  crypto could be abstracted down to a seamless, user-friendly interface where the desired fulfillment of outcomes is expressed in natural language, simplifying complex transaction operations which are delegated to be executed by a competitive network of Solvers whose integrity is maintained through cryptographic measures. \n\nAperture’s Role \n\nWhile there are a number of exciting projects focused on blockchain networks and AI, few protocols lie at the intersection of AI, user-centric intents, and core DeFi primitives. Aperture aims to play a critical role in reshaping the future of user experiences onchain, by leveraging a myriad of evolving technical developments centered around efficiency and security. By utilizing a proprietary DSL, Aperture enables users to write intents using natural language, greatly simplifying the expression of these requests. By delegating the complexity of execution to Solvers, Aperture ensures that users can interact with DeFi protocols safely and effectively, fulfilling their requests exactly as they envision. By leveraging ZKPs, Aperture ensures that the Solvers responsible for executing user intents are acting in good faith and being appropriately rewarded for their services. \n\nWrapping up\n\nAs nascent as DeFi is, it's very clear it is here to stay as new technology is injected into the ecosystem. Not only does it improve operations for sophisticated actors but we can see the potential for these technologies to create a more accessible, user-friendly, and secure DeFi environment for even beginner and retail users. \n\nReferences\n\nDeFiLlama.

The concept of a blockchain was first put into writing in Satoshi Nakomoto’s infamous Bitcoin whitepaper in 2008, as the core infrastructure enabling cryptographically secured peer-to-peer payments in Bitcoin. Transactions are to blockchains what logs are to social media and internet companies; they serve as records of activity for that particular network, the key difference being that transactions on a blockchain are immutable and often publicly observable. \n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nSubscribe\n\nBut what exactly is a transaction? \n\nTransactions on blockchains involve the transfer of digital assets from one address on the distributed ledger to another, secured by the use of public key cryptography. Transactions can be used for decentralized peer to peer transfers, or for various authentication and verification processes as well. \n\nAn example of a transaction which anyone can observe on a blockchain explorer like SeiTrace\n\n1.1 How Blockchain Transactions Work \n\nWhen a transaction is initiated, i.e. Bob sends some tokens to Alice, Bob’s transaction is broadcast to the underlying blockchain network. Subsequently, clusters of specialized nodes on the network get to work verifying and validating the transaction as legitimate. Once enough of these nodes have verified the contents of the transaction, the transaction gets added to a block along with other user transactions. Once a block is full, it then gets added to the chain, hence the name ‘blockchain'. Bob’s transaction is now part of a secure and transparent ledger, and he and Alice can both verify the contents. \n\nBroadly speaking, all blockchain transactions contain metadata that helps the nodes operating and securing the network identify and execute a given set of instructions and parameters. Every transaction will have high-level data input by the original sender, such as the amount to be transferred, the destination address, and the digital signature to confirm the transaction, as well as various low-level data that is created and attached automatically, though this data varies by network and design.\n\nUltimately, however, the processes involved behind the scenes at the networking layer prior to transaction execution vary by the design of the blockchain. \n\n1.1.1 Mempool \n\nA memory pool, or mempool, is a common feat of blockchain designs, implemented by traditional blockchain networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Mempools are simply buffer zones, or ‘waiting rooms’, for pending transactions which are yet to be added to a block and executed. \n\nTo better understand, we can lay out the lifecycle of a transaction on a blockchain which uses a mempool;\n\nThe user initiates and signs a transaction.  \n\nSpecialized nodes participating in the blockchain network verify the contents of the transaction to be legitimate and contain appropriate parameters. \n\nOnce verified, the transaction is routed to the public mempool alongside other pending transactions. \n\nEventually, depending on the gas fee paid for the transaction relative to other transactions in the mempool, our user’s pending transaction is selected with a cluster of other pending transactions to form the next block on the blockchain. At this stage, our transaction status will read “Successful”. \n\nAfter a certain time or block-based threshold has passed, the block itself is finalized and the transaction becomes an immutable log recorded on the blockchain, which could only be compromised in the event of a 51% attack, an extremely difficult task to perform otherwise. \n\n1.1.2. No Mempool (Solana)\n\nIt’s important to note that some blockchains, such as Solana, do not employ a mempool, and may instead forward transactions directly to the block producer as a means of enabling high speed and throughput through continuous block production. \n\nLet’s walk through the lifecycle of a transaction on a non-mempool blockchain:\n\nUser initiates and signs a transaction for an application they are using.  \n\nThe application routes the transaction info to the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) server. \n\nThe RPC provider sends the transaction to the current designated block producer, and the next three producers; this is a precautionary step in the event that the current leader cannot execute the transaction in time. Solana employs a slot leader schedule which helps RPCs route the transactions easier. \n\nThe block producer then sends the signed transaction to consensus nodes for verification. \n\nConsensus nodes vote to verify the contents of the transaction, and once completed, the transaction status is then routed back to RPC > application > user as either ‘success’ or ‘failed’. \n\nSimilar to mempool-based blockchains, the block itself is finalized after a certain time or block-based threshold has passed. \n\n1.2  Sequential Execution  \n\nOlder blockchains, namely Bitcoin and Ethereum, utilize a sequential execution mechanism for transactions. Every transaction added to the blockchain invokes a change in the network’s state, and the VM is structured to only process one state change at a time for security purposes. \n\nThis has led to significant bottlenecks for the throughput of the underlying network, as the number of transactions that can be added to the block gets limited, leading to longer wait times and unprecedented spikes in transaction costs which can render the network unusable at times. Furthermore, sequential execution models utilize hardware components rather inefficiently, and thus do not benefit from breakthroughs in computing, i.e. multiple processor cores. \n\nParallel Execution \n2.0 What is Parallel Execution? \n\nParallel computing is a key component of computer architecture whose origins can be traced back as far back as the late 1950s, though its ideation and theory has even been traced back to 1837.  By definition, parallel computing refers to the act of utilizing multiple processing elements simultaneously to solve an operation, wherein a larger and more complex task is divided into smaller ones to be completed more efficiently than in a serial manner. \n\nOriginally only implemented in high performance computing systems, parallel computing has evolved to become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture today, as demand for compute has exponentially increased in the internet era, exacerbated by the limitations of frequency scaling in prior decades. \n\nThis architectural standard applies to blockchains in much the same way, only that the primary task which computers solve is the processing and execution of transactions, or the transfer of value from smart contract A to smart contract B, hence the term parallel execution. \n\nParallel execution means that instead of processing transactions serially, a blockchain can process multiple non-conflicting transactions simultaneously. This can greatly increase the throughput of a blockchain network, making it more scalable and efficient to handle higher loads of activity and demand for blockspace. \n\nFor a simpler analogy. consider the efficiency of a grocery store with multiple lanes for shoppers to check out. vs just one for everyone. \n\nWhy is Parallel Execution important?\n\nParallel execution in blockchains is designed to unlock efficiencies in the speed and performance of a network, especially as the network sees higher traffic and resource demand. In the context of crypto ecosystems, parallel execution means that if Bob wants to mint the latest popular NFT collection, and Alice wants to buy her favorite memecoin, the network will serve both users without compromising any quality in performance and thus user experience. \n\nWhile this may come across as simply an intuitive quality-of-life feature, the unlocks in network performance enabled by parallel execution gives way to the development of new and innovative use cases and applications which can leverage low-latency and high volumes, which in itself lays the groundwork for onboarding the next mass cohort of users to crypto ecosystems. \n\nHow Does Parallel Execution Work? \n\nAlthough the premise of parallel execution is relatively straightforward, nuances in the designs of the underlying blockchains affect how the process of parallel execution itself plays out. The most relevant feature to designing blockchains with parallel execution is the transactions’ ability to access the state of its underlying network, including account balances, storage, and smart contracts. \n\nParallel execution on blockchains can be categorized as either deterministic or optimistic. Deterministic parallel execution, employed by blockchains like Solana, inherently requires transactions to declare all memory dependencies upfront, i.e. which parts of the global state they wish to access upfront. While this step creates additional overhead for developers, more broadly it allows the network to sort and identify non-conflicting transactions prior to execution, creating an optimized system that is predictable and efficient. Conversely, optimistic parallel execution is structured to process all transactions in parallel, operating under the inherent assumption there are no conflicts. This enables the underlying blockchain to deliver faster transaction execution, though at the cost of potential re-execution afterward in the event of a conflict. If two conflicting transactions are found to be submitted, the system can then re-process and re-execute them either in parallel or sequentially. \n\nIn order to better understand the implications of these design intricacies, it can be helpful to analyze parallel execution through the lens of teams pushing the frontier of parallel execution today. \n\nState of Parallel Execution Today \n\nIn order to better understand the implications of these design intricacies, it can be helpful to analyze parallel execution through the lens of teams pushing the frontier of parallel execution today. \n\n3.1 Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)\n\nSolana was the first blockchain network to be designed around parallel execution, inspired by founder Anatoly Yakovenko’s previous experience in the telecommunications industry. Solana aims to provide a developer platform which runs as fast as physics allows, therefore the speed and efficiency unlocked by parallel computing was a simple and intuitive design choice.  \n\nA critical component to enabling Solana’s fast speeds and high throughput is Sealevel, the network’s parallel smart contracts runtime environment. Unlike EVM and WASM-based environments, Sealevel employs a multi-threaded architecture, meaning it can process multiple transactions simultaneously to the extent of the validator core’s capacity. \n\nThe key to enabling Solana’s parallel execution is that when a transaction is enabled, the network will assign a list of instructions for that transaction to be executed, specifically which accounts and state to access and what changes to make - this is key to determining which transactions are non-conflicting and can execute simultaneously, as well as enabling transactions which are attempting to access the same state to do so concurrently.\n\nConsider the efficiency that labels provide to checked baggage systems at airports. \n\nSolana also utilizes Cloudbreak, its own custom accountsDB, for storing and managing state data to enable concurrent reads and writes of transactions. Cloudbreak, optimized for parallel execution, scales horizontally to distribute and manage state data across multiple nodes. \n\nThanks to its parallel architecture, Solana can handle a large number of transactions and still execute quickly, giving transactions near-instant finality. Solana handles between 2,000 and 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) on average today. Furthermore, use cases for the SVM are slowly but surely expanding, as teams like Eclipse are rolling out Layer 2 infrastructure which aims to take advantage of the SVM as an execution environment. \n\n3.2 Parallel EVM \n\nThe Parallel EVM describes a new execution environment for blockchains which aims to bring the “best of both worlds” from Solana and Ethereum’s designs, with the speed and performance of Solana, and the security and liquidity of Ethereum. By processing transactions in parallel rather than sequentially as per the traditional EVM design, parallel EVMs enable developers to build applications on a highly performant network while being able to leverage connections to EVM liquidity and developer tooling. \n\n3.2.1 Sei Network\n\nSei Network is an EVM-compatible, open source Layer 1 blockchain which hosts a variety of decentralized applications built around high performance. Sei was built around delivering fast speeds at low costs for users and developers, and parallel execution is a key component of enabling this performance and UX. Currently, Sei delivers 390ms block confirmation times and has processed over 1.9B transactions on its pacific mainnet. \n\nOriginally, Sei employed a deterministic parallel execution model, wherein smart contacts declare their required state access ahead of time in order for the system to run non-conflicting transactions simultaneously. With the onset of their V2 upgrade, Sei is transitioning to an optimistic parallel model instead, meaning all transactions will be processed in parallel upon being submitted to the network (the execution stage), and then will be reviewed for conflicting information with previous transactions (the validation stage). In the event of two or more conflicting transactions, i.e. transactions attempting to access the same network state, Sei identifies this point of conflict and then re-runs the transactions either in parallel or sequentially depending on the nature of the conflict. \n\nIn order to store and maintain transaction data, Sei will also introduce SeiDB, a custom database which aims to improve upon shortcomings in v1 by optimizing for parallel execution. SeiDB aims to bring down the overhead of storing redundant data and maintaining efficient disk usage for better network performance. V2 reduces the amount of metadata needed for tracking and storage purposes, and enables a write-ahead log to aid with data recovery in the event of a crash. \n\nLastly, Sei has also recently announced the launch of its Parallel Stack, an open-source framework for enabling Layer 2 scaling solutions, i.e. rollups, to utilize and benefit from parallel execution. \n\n3.2.2 Monad \n\nMonad is an upcoming parallel-EVM Layer 1 blockchain bringing full bytecode and RPC compatibility for Ethereum applications and infrastructure. Through a number of innovative technical implementations, Monad aims to deliver more interactive experiences than existing blockchains while maintaining lower transaction costs by optimizing for performance and portability, with 1 second block times and finality with up to 10,000 TPS. \n\nMonad  implements parallel execution and superscalar pipelining to optimize the speed and throughput of transactions. Similar to Sei v2, Monad will employ an optimistic execution model, meaning the network starts executing all incoming transactions simultaneously, and then analyzes and validates the transactions to look for conflicts and re-execute accordingly, with the end goal being that the outcome would be identical had the transactions been executed sequentially. \n\nIt’s important to note that in maintaining synchronicity with Ethereum, Monad orders transactions in a block in linear order, with each transaction updated sequentially. \n\nIn order to maintain and access blockchain data more efficiently than the current state of Ethereum clients offers, Monad created its own custom MonadDB, built natively for blockchains. Monad DB leverages advanced Linux kernel features for efficient asynchronous disk operations, eliminating the constraints of synchronous input/output access. MonadDB offers asynchronous input/output (async I/O) access, a key feature in enabling parallel execution, wherein the system can start processing the next transaction while waiting to read state for a prior transaction. \n\nFor a simple analogy, consider cooking a multi-faceted meal (spaghetti with meatballs). The steps involved are 1) preparing a sauce, 2) cooking the meatballs, and c) cooking the pasta. An efficient chef would start by boiling water for the pasta, then preparing ingredients for the sauce, then tossing the pasta in the now-boiling water, then cooking the sauce, and finally the meatballs, as opposed to doing each step one at a time, completing one task in its entirety before moving on. \n\n3.3 Move \n\nMove is a programming language originally developed by the Facebook team in 2019 for its now-defunct Diem project. Move was designed to handle smart contract and transaction data in a secure manner, eliminating attack vectors native to other languages such as reentrancy attacks. \n\nThe MoveVM serves as the native execution environment for Move-based blockchains, taking advantage of parallelization to deliver faster transaction execution speeds and greater overall efficiency. \n\n3.3.1 Aptos \n\nAptos is a Move-based Layer 1 blockchain developed by members of the former Diem project, which implements parallel execution to deliver a high performance environment for application developers. Aptos utilizes Block-STM, a modified implementation of the Software Transactional Memory (STM) concurrency control mechanism. \n\nBlock-STM is a multi-threaded parallel execution engine which enables for optimistic parallel execution. Transactions are pre-ordered and strategically sequenced inside of blocks, which is key to efficiently resolving conflicts and re-executing those transactions. Research conducted by Aptos has found that up to 160K TPS can be theoretically supported using Block-STM’s parallelization. \n\n3.3.2 Sui \n\nSimilar to Aptos, Sui is a layer 1 blockchain developed by former members of the Diem project, which utilizes the Move language. However, Sui utilizes a custom implementation of Move which changes the storage model and asset permissions from the original Diem design. In particular, this allows Sui to utilize a state storage model to represent independent transactions as objects. Each object has a unique ID within Sui’s execution environment, and in doing so, this allows the system to easily identify non-conflicting transactions and process them in parallel.  \n\nSimilar to Solana, Sui implements deterministic parallel execution, which requires transactions to state which accounts they need to access ahead of time. \n\n3.3.3 Movement Labs\n\nWhat is Movement? \n\nMovement is building a suite of developer tooling and blockchain infrastructure services for enabling developers to easily access the benefits of building on Move. Operating as an AWS-like execution-as-a-service provider for Move developers, Movement implements parallelization as a core design feature for enabling higher throughput and greater overall network efficiency. The MoveVM is a modular execution environment which enables blockchain networks to expand and adjust their transaction processing capabilities as needed to be able to support an increasing volume of transactions, bolstering their abilities to process and execute transactions in parallel. \n\nMoveVM Architecture\n\nMovement will also be launching M2, a ZK-rollup which will be interoperable with EVM and Move clients alike. M2 will inherit the Block-STM parallelization engine, and is expected to deliver tens of thousands of TPS as a result. \n\nClosing Thoughts \n4.1 Challenges For Parallel Systems Today \n\nSome important questions and considerations to be pondered upon regarding the development of parallel blockchains;\n\nWhat tradeoffs is the network making to enable better performance through parallel execution? \n\nLess validators securing the network enables faster verification and execution speeds, but does this compromise the security of the blockchain in that it becomes easier for validators to collude against the network? \n\nIs there a significant number of validators colocated? This is a common strategy for minimizing latency in both crypto and non-crypto systems alike, but what happens to the network in the event of that particular data center being compromised? \n\nFor optimistic parallel systems, does the process of re-executing invalid transactions create a bottleneck as the network scales? How is this efficiency being tested and evaluated? \n\nAt a high level, parallel blockchains face the risk of ledger inconsistencies, i.e. double spending and changes in the order of transactions (indeed, this is the key benefit of sequential execution). Deterministic parallelization addresses this by creating an internal labeling system for transactions on the underlying blockchain. Blockchains implementing optimistic processing must ensure the mechanisms they use to validate and re-execute transactions is secure and functional, and the tradeoffs made for performance can be reasonably implemented.\n\n4.2 Future Outlook / Opportunities \n\nThe history of computers has taught us that parallel systems tend to be more efficient and scalable over time than sequential systems. The rise of post-Solana parallel blockchains emphasizes that this notion applies to crypto infrastructure as well. Even Vitalik has alluded to parallelization as a one of the potential key solutions for improving the scalability of EVM rollups recently. Broadly speaking, crypto/blockchain adoption growth calls for systems that are more optimal than what is available today, including parallel blockchains. Solana’s recent network struggles have highlighted that there is plenty of room for improvement in the development of parallel blockchains. As more teams seek to push the boundaries of the onchain frontier and onboard the next mass cohort of users and adoption to blockchain-native applications and ecosystems, parallel execution models provide an intuitive framework for building systems that can efficiently handle magnitudes of network activity at a scale which matches that of Web2 companies with ease. \n\nWorks Cited\n\nDixon, C.

However, the common thread that brings all stakeholders in crypto together is trading. Almost every user partakes in trading, whether it involves long or short positions on exchanges, asset swapping in liquidity pools, or the exchange of non-fungible tokens on NFT marketplaces. Interestingly, even illiquid assets are traded in the crypto space, primarily through a peer-to-peer (P2P) process.\n\nDue to the absence of a liquid market for illiquid assets, the trading of items like crypto points, airdrop allocations, and whitelists typically occurs in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. In this scenario, individuals engage in conversations and negotiate deals with one another regarding the trading process. However, a significant challenge arises in the form of trust among participants. Trust is pivotal as one must rely on the certainty that a specific user possesses the designated assets and will deliver them after the proposed deal. This introduces the possibility of malicious activities and poses a risk.\n\nWhat if we could establish a trustless third party that enables secure trading for both parties, providing security and preventing fraudulent activities? This is precisely what Whales Market aims to accomplish.\n\nAirdrops 101\n\nAs most of us know, an airdrop is the process of sending free tokens to selected wallet addresses or users who meet certain criteria (who have done certain activities during a certain period of time). But how did it all start?\n\nThe first crypto airdrop occurred in March 2014 when Iceland launched Auroracoin. Each citizen received free coins, starting with 31.8 AUR and increasing to 636 coins. The purpose of these airdrops was to create a market for the token and generate awareness. However, it's important to note that sending tokens required payment for gas, which became expensive as gas prices and ETH's price rose.\n\nThen airdrops shifted to free token claims. Recipients could claim tokens for free but had to pay transaction gas. The cost of gas is usually small compared to the token value, so it's generally not an issue. However, as projects evolved, they realized giving away tokens to random users who might just sell them was detrimental. Initially, launching tokens early allowed projects to gauge interest and secure funds. But later, after significant investment, it became clear that giving away tokens to random users was not beneficial and could harm the projects.\n\nIn September 2020, Uniswap made a significant impact by airdropping $UNI tokens to over 250k addresses. These addresses were eligible because they had interacted with the platform before September 1st, 2020, and were granted at least 400 $UNI tokens. The airdropped $UNI tokens provided voting power, which remains their primary utility, allowing users to vote on protocol changes and proposals.\n\nThis led to the emergence of a new user group known as airdrop farmers. They would farm transactions that didn't contribute much to the protocol's value but allowed them to rank higher in airdrop rewards. For instance, if the airdrop was based on the number of transactions a wallet made, they would create numerous transactions by repeatedly moving the same amount, even if it incurred costs.\n\nIn response to airdrop farming, projects have implemented more advanced strategies and mechanisms. The Optimism L2 platform introduced a two-tiered airdrop, where users had to actively participate in the protocol's governance to qualify for the second tier, which occurred nine months later. The Blur NFT marketplace implemented a multi-tier airdrop mechanism to gain market share from OpenSea. They required users who listed their NFTs on other platforms to also list them on Blur at a lower or equal price, and utilize certain protocol features like NFT collection bids. In the latest airdrop tier, users are even required to delist their NFTs from other marketplaces to receive the maximum $BLUR airdrop.\n\nPoints 101\n\nProjects are adopting a \"points system\" in which users earn points for their contributions to the community. Founders are increasingly incorporating offchain points programs into their applications, as seen in various examples such as:\n\nRainbow wallet rewarding Ethereum usage with points\n\nFriend.tech basing its engagement loop on points\n\nBlur introducing L2 Blast Points as incentives for fund bridging (with over $800 million TVL since November).\n\nThis trend emerges as part of a wider exploration for product-market compatibility in the cryptocurrency industry and strategies to engage users during a downturn in the market.\n\nThere are discussions among users regarding the possibility that these accumulated points will be converted into the project's token, following a trend observed in recent notable airdrops.\n\nTrading Illiquid Crypto Markets\n\nThere are lots of things in crypto that have no decentralized exchange to trade on. Such things include whitelists, airdrop allocations before the TGE, points, P2P trading of tokens and NFTs, and so on. \n\nFor a long time, trading of those things has been commonly done through social groups, private messages, and centralized platforms. However, these methods often lack security measures, which puts traders at risk of scams where fraudsters fail to deliver the tokens they promised.\n\nThe primary reason for this is that these trades do not necessitate commitment from the involved parties, as the trading routes between them are isolated and predominantly rely on the trading routes between both parties.\n\nWhile there is currently no decentralized market for it, the existence of such a market could improve liquidity and benefit both buyers and sellers. In order to achieve this, a solution is needed to integrate a trustless system that can prevent malicious actions.\n\nIntroducing Whales Market\n\nWhales market was made specially to address the issues described in the previous section - make trading of illiquid assets more secure, trustless, and accessible for everyone.\n\nWhales Market tackles this by consolidating OTC trading on a unified platform. Here, both buyers and sellers can engage in on-chain transactions that are mutually agreed upon. Funds are secured in smart contracts and are only disbursed to the involved parties upon completion of a successful transaction. This feature not only simplifies the trading process but also notably minimizes the potential for financial losses stemming from fraudulent activities.\n\nWhales Market was developed by the same team behind LootBot. This protocol was created during the summer of 2023, during the popularity of Telegram Bots. The concept was straightforward yet practical: a Telegram bot designed to streamline the majority of laborious tasks involved in airdrop farming.\n\nLeveraging the team's success with LootBot, they decided to build a more ambitious and complex product – Whales Market.\n\nProduct Overview\n\nWhales Market supports 3 main types of the markets: Pre-Launch Market, OTC Market, Points Market. Let’s explore the details of all of them.\n\nSupported Markets\n\nThe core system powering pre-market token trading on Whales Market relies on collateral. Sellers lock up assets as collateral, assuring buyers they'll receive the tokens once officially released by the foundation. Should a seller fail to fulfill their order, their collateral goes to the buyer as compensation.\n\nHowever, this system isn't without its potential drawbacks, particularly when dealing with points systems. Let's delve deeper into these risks in the following sections.\n\nPre Market\n\nWe have written previously about Perpetual Pre-Launch Futures and how perpetual futures exchanges enable traders to leverage trade assets that have not yet been launched.\n\nHowever, Whales Pre Market is different, in that it allows buying pre-TGE token allocations. As most of you know, that is the common thing among different private communities and some centralized platforms. These methods often fall short in terms of security, leaving traders vulnerable to scams and non-delivery of promised tokens. Whales Market transforms this process by using smart contracts, enabling on-chain transactions agreed upon by both buyers and sellers to prevent the fraud activities.\n\nThere are 2 ways to buy & sell tokens:\n\nCreate your own offer to buy or sell\n\nFill others’ offer to buy or sell\n\nBoth sellers and buyers are required to wait for the Token Generation Event (TGE) before they are able to settle or cancel orders. When TGE happens and the tokens are released by the foundation, the settlement between buyers and sellers will countdown for 24 hours. If sellers fail to settle in time, they will lose their collateral funds. Those funds will be transferred to the buyer, if they decide to cancel the order.\n\nOTC Market\n\nTraditionally, OTC Markets facilitated P2P trading of tokens and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) through various informal mediums like chat rooms, social media sites, and direct messaging. \n\nWhile such methods are convenient, they lack stringent security measures, making traders susceptible to fraud and scams. Similar to the Pre-Launch Market, Whales Market uses smart contracts to address vulnerabilities to reduce the risk of potential losses.\n\nIn order to guarantee user safety, Whales Market upholds a list of tokens approved for OTC Markets trading. This list is carefully assembled from tokens that have achieved a minimum liquidity pool of $300,000 in their largest pool on a DEX.\n\nUsers can also trade tokens that are not the list, but the platform will display a warning sign, prompting users to verify their mint address before proceeding with the trade. \n\nTo maintain the privacy of creators’ offers, Whales Market has implemented a new functionality. This feature allows them to share the offer access link exclusively with the individuals they are negotiating deals with. As a result, private offers are not visible on the public marketplace and can only be accessed through the unique offer link provided by the creators.\n\nScreenshot taken from Whales Market UI.\nPoints Market\n\nSimilar to OTC Market, Points Market allows secure P2P trading of points. The amount of projects using “points system” grows every day, and as most us know, with growth comes the room for speculation. Whales Market utilizes smart contracts to allow the mutually agreed on-chain transactions between buyer and seller.\n\nOnce the foundation releases the tokens, a 24-hour settlement countdown will begin. Following the token release, Whales Market will automatically convert points into the corresponding tokens based on the foundation's announcement.\n\nRisks Involved\n\nOrders for points have to be set in advance, but the final conversion ratio into tokens isn't revealed until the TGE. This can lead to situations where the seller's points end up significantly exceeding the value of the tokens they receive, potentially creating an unfavorable outcome for the seller.\n\nCurrently, Whales Market allows trading points of Friend.tech. In the future, they’re planning to add these features for such protocols as MarginFi, Kamino, EigenLayer, and Rainbow.\n\nTokenomics\n\nThe whole ecosystem of Whales Market is centered around its native token - $WHALES. Main utility features of $WHALES token include:\n\nRevenue-sharing: 60% of the fees collected is redistributed to $WHALES token stakers\n\nDevelopment expenses: 20% is allocated to cover ongoing development expenses\n\nBuyback and Burn: 10% is used to buy back and burn tokens, creating deflationary mechanism\n\n$LOOT revenue-sharing: 10% is shared to $LOOT stakers and $xLOOT holders.\n\nTo ensure that emissions contribute to the growth of the protocol, token emissions are linked to specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to trading volume.  $WHALES holders have the ability to participate in voting for these KPIs.\n\nThe Whales Market team demonstrates their long-term commitment to the growth of the protocol through a cliff period of 9 months and a vesting period of 36 months allocating only 9.5% of the total supply to themselves.\n\nStaking\n\nWhales Market earns revenue by collecting fees from OTC markets, and 60% of these fees are distributed to $WHALES stakers. When users stake $WHALES, they are rewarded with $xWHALES, which serves two purposes: receiving a share of the revenue and acting as collateral in all OTC markets.\n\nThe staking mechanism works as following:\n\nThe staking contract includes a pool that consists of two types of tokens: $WHALES and $xWHALES.\n\nParticipants stake their $WHALES tokens and receive $xWHALES tokens in return.\n\nHolding $xWHALES tokens entitles stakers to an increasing amount of $WHALES rewards.\n\nTo achieve this, the contract continuously purchases $WHALES tokens using generated revenue, which are then added to the staking pool.\n\nThe conversion rate of $xWHALES to $WHALES increases, benefiting the stakers.\n\nThis mechanism also prevents dumping of $WHALES tokens after claiming rewards, as the rewards are distributed gradually over time. \n\nRewards Distribution\n\nDepending on the blockchain (EVM, SOL, etc.) and the specific market, fees are gathered in different assets. In order to simplify the process of claiming rewards, the protocol converts these collected tokens into $WHALES tokens at regular intervals. \n\nThese transactions can be easily observed on the protocol's dashboard. The distributed $WHALES tokens are then evenly shared among the stakers as rewards.\n\nStakers have the flexibility to withdraw their $xWHALES tokens at any time and convert them back into $WHALES tokens.\n\nRevenues\nWhales incurred daily fees.\n\nAs we mentioned in the Tokenomics section, Whales Market earns revenue by collecting fees from their markets: Pre Market, OTC market, and Points Market. Let’s explore the fees they’re charging and which actions require a fee.\n\nIn the Pre Market, certain actions such as closing an offer, settling an order, buying a token, and canceling an order are subject to fee charges. If you choose to close an offer, a platform fee of 0.5% is required. For settling an order (buying), a platform fee of 2.5% applies. When you make an offer to buy or fill another user's offer to sell, there is also a 2.5% platform fee on the total tokens purchased. If you cancel a buy token order due to the seller ghosting you, a platform fee of 2.5% will be incurred.\n\nIn the OTC Market, Whales Market only charges fees for listing and selling. Whenever you create an offer, regardless of whether it is for buying or selling, a fee of 0.1% is applied and included in your overall deposit. When you fulfill a buy offer by selling tokens, a fee of 0.1% is applicable and deducted from the amount you receive.\n\nIn the Points Market, users are charged a fee for closing an offer (buy or sell), settling and canceling an order, as well as buying points. If you choose to close an offer, the platform fee is 0.5%. For all other cases, the fee amount required is 2.5%.\n\nValuation\n\nIn order to determine a fair valuation for the Whales Market, we will conduct a comparative analysis using three key metrics:\n\nEarnings to TVL ratio\n\nMarket Cap to TVL ratio\n\nStaked assets to Market Cap ratio\n\nThese metrics will be compared against two primary competitors: Uniswap and Blur. Uniswap is selected as the most popular decentralized exchange (DEX) currently, while Blur is chosen for its position as the most popular non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace with its own points system, which notably surpassed OpenSea.\n\nBy comparing these metrics, we aim to gain insights into the relative valuation of Whales Market in relation to established players in the blockchain space.\n\nEarning to TVL ratio\n\nThe current earnings to TVL ratio is as follows:\n\nWhales Market: 0.02\n\nBlur Marketplace: 0.36\n\nThe fees have been generated since the launch of the protocols. Although Blur appears to have a much better ratio, it is worth noting that Blur is significantly older than Whales Market, which only launched at the beginning of January 2023. \n\nHowever, when we examine the statistics of the past two months and compare the earnings to TVL during this period, we obtain noticeably different results:\n\nWhales Market: 0.02\n\nBlur Marketplace: 0.02\n\nIt is evident that they currently share equal ratios, indicating that they generate fee percentages at almost identical levels. The current FDV of Blur stands at $2.26 billion, while the current valuation of Whales Market is $264.33 million, implying a significant discrepancy of almost tenfold between the two.\n\nMarket Cap to TVL ratio\n\nNow, let’s compare the Market Cap to TVL ratio among Whales Market, Blur, and Uniswap:\n\nWhales Market – 1.35\n\nUniswap – 1.13\n\nBlur – 5.94\n\nAs we can see, Blur has the highest ratio here, indicating that the valuation may be a little bit overrated compared to Uniswap and Whales Market.\n\nIt’s important to mention that TVL in Market Cap is slightly different and is called Total Value Escrowed (TVE) in the case of Whales Market, which serves as an escrow between two parties. The mechanism in Uniswap and other DEXes is slightly different.\n\nStaked assets to Market Cap ratio\n\nThis metric is only applicable to Blur and Whales Market. So let’s explore the current Staked assets to Market Cap ratio between those protocols:\n\nWhales Market – 35%\n\nBlur Marketplace – 30%\n\nBasically, what it means is Whales Market still has a lot of room for growth in terms of staked assets in the protocol, the ratios of those protocols are pretty close, but we should also remember that Whales Market is only 3 months old.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Whales Market offers a comprehensive solution for illiquid and decentralized cryptocurrency markets. With its product overview, it provides support for various markets including OTC, pre-launch, and points market. Additionally, the tokenomics, staking options, and revenue streams ensure a sustainable and profitable ecosystem. Overall, the Whales Market presents a promising platform that addresses the challenges faced by P2P traders in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nNot financial or tax advice. The purpose of this newsletter is purely educational and should not be considered as investment advice, legal advice, a request to buy or sell any assets, or a suggestion to make any financial decisions.

Released in the first half of 2021 after the fervor of DeFi summer, a period marked by the explosive growth of yield farming, Fuse quickly gained traction. This platform, a brainchild of Rari Capital, revolutionized the DeFi space by enabling users to create and manage their own permissionless lending pools, aligning with the burgeoning trend of yield optimization.\n\nDuring its rise, Rari Capital embraced the (9,9) narrative, which was popularized by Olympus DAO, a strategy aimed at leveraging OHM yields. This period of growth and community-building was further amplified by Rari Capital's merger with Fei Protocol. The merger between Rari Capital and Fei Protocol in November 2021 was centered around a specific vision: to build a comprehensive DeFi platform that integrated Rari's lending protocols with Fei's stablecoin mechanisms. \n\nHowever, everything came tumbling down in April of 2022 when Fuse fell victim to a reentrancy attack that led to a staggering loss of funds, estimated to be around $80 million. The incident led to intense scrutiny of Rari Capital's security practices and raised broader concerns about the vulnerability of DeFi platforms to such exploits. In the wake of this crisis, Tribe DAO, the governing body formed after the merger of Rari Capital and Fei Protocol, faced tough decisions. The pressure and challenges stemming from the hack eventually led to the shutdown of Tribe DAO and Rari Capital later in the year. This closure marked a significant moment in the DeFi space, highlighting the fragility of even the most innovative platforms in the face of security threats and the critical importance of robust, foolproof protocols in decentralized finance.\n\nRevitalization of Permissionless Lending\n\nIn the wake of the Rari Capital hack in April 2022, and the significant Euler hack in 2023, where $200 million was compromised, the DeFi sector faced heightened skepticism, especially regarding security. Euler, known for its innovative permissionless lending protocol that allows users to lend and borrow a wide range of crypto assets, became another stark reminder of the vulnerabilities in the DeFi ecosystem. These major security breaches fueled a broader sense of pessimism across the industry, raising serious concerns about the safety and reliability of decentralized finance platforms.\n\nHowever, the latter half of 2023 marked a quiet resurgence in the DeFi lending sector, beginning with the launch of Ajna in mid-July. This revival continued with the announcement of Morpho Blue on October 10, 2023. What distinguished these emerging protocols in the revitalized DeFi lending landscape was their shift in narrative from purely \"permissionless\" to emphatically \"modular.\" Instead of solely focusing on the unrestricted access that permissionless systems offer, platforms like Ajna and Morpho Blue began to emphasize their \"modular\" nature. This approach presented them as base layer technologies, upon which third-party developers could build and customize lending use cases. This pivot towards modularity highlighted the flexibility and adaptability of these platforms, encouraging innovation and specialization in lending solutions. Alongside this modular narrative, there was also a strong emphasis on security. Ajna, for instance, differentiated itself by being oracle-less, eliminating reliance on external price feeds and thereby reducing points of vulnerability. Morpho Blue introduced the concept of \"permissionless risk management\" delegating the responsibility to 3rd parties to pick and choose the lending markets with the most risk-adjusted return. \n\nState of Affairs Today': DeFi Liquidity is Back\n\nAs we enter 2024, there’s a noticeable buzz within crypto at large and DeFi. This resurgence is often attributed to new mechanisms of token distribution, a theory popularized by Tushar from Multicoin. His theory is that each crypto bull market is sparked by innovative token distribution methods. In this current market, the concept of 'points' has become a significant driver, with platforms like Eigenlayer leading the charge through their restaking ecosystem. This method is not only drawing renewed interest but is also shaping the dynamics of the market. Concurrently, the diversity of on-chain asset types is expanding, which adds depth to the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nWith all that said, it is imperative that we have the necessary lending systems and infrastructure in place as institutions and degens alike will seek on-chain leverage. While established protocols like Compound and Aave have facilitated billions of dollars in transactions, their limited capacity to accommodate diverse collateral types necessitates the emergence of alternative on-chain lending platforms. Over the past 1-2 years, the landscape has witnessed the rise of new lending protocols such as Morpho, Ajna, and Euler, each vying for a share of the on-chain lending market. Furthermore, we’ve witnessed the surge of NFT lending protocols like Metastreet and Blur. This essay aims to explore the narratives and functionalities of these projects, providing readers with insights into their respective differences and contributions as we look ahead.\n\nMorpho Protocol\n\nMorpho’s Origins\n\nMorpho's origin story and the decision to develop Morpho Blue are rooted in the protocol's initial success and a deep understanding of the limitations within the DeFi lending space. Launched by Paul Frambot and his team at Morpho Labs, Morpho quickly rose to prominence, becoming the third-largest lending platform on Ethereum with over $1 billion in deposited assets within a year. This impressive growth was driven by Morpho Optimizer, which operated on top of existing protocols like Compound and Aave, enhancing their interest rate model efficiency. However, Morpho's growth was eventually constrained by the design limitations of these underlying lending pools.\n\nThese realizations led to a rethinking of decentralized lending from the ground up. The Morpho team, with their extensive experience, recognized the need to evolve beyond the existing model to achieve a new level of autonomy and efficiency in DeFi lending. This evolution gave birth to Morpho Blue. Morpho Blue was envisioned to address several key issues in DeFi lending:\n\nTrust Assumptions: The protocol reduces trust assumptions by allowing more decentralized and dynamic risk management. This addresses the issue of numerous risk parameters that need constant monitoring and adjustment, which can be a primary cause of security breaches.\n\nScalability and Efficiency: By moving away from the DAO-style management model, Morpho Blue aims to enhance scalability and efficiency. This includes addressing capital efficiency and rate optimization issues inherent in current decentralized lending models.\n\nDecentralized Risk Management: Morpho Blue focuses on permissionless risk management, enabling a more transparent and effective approach to handling risks in lending platforms.\n\nThe development of Morpho Blue represents a significant shift towards building more unopinionated and trustless lending primitives in DeFi. This shift is complemented by the potential for building abstraction layers on top of these primitives, allowing for a more resilient, efficient, and open DeFi ecosystem at its core.\n\nMorpho Blue (& MetaMorpho) - Protocol Analysis\n\nThe Morpho protocol operates on two distinct layers: Morpho Blue and MetaMorpho, each serving a unique function within the ecosystem.\n\nMorpho Blue is designed to allow anyone to permissionlessly deploy and manage their own lending market. A key characteristic of each Morpho Blue Market is its simplicity and specificity: it supports only one collateral asset and one loan asset, along with a defined loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and a specified oracle for price feeds. This framework ensures that each market is straightforward and focused, making it accessible for a wide range of users. Morpho Blue is also governance-minimized, featuring a concise and efficient codebase with just 650 lines of Solidity, enhancing its security and reliability. Additionally, Morpho Blue includes a fee switch, governed by $MORPHO token holders, which adds a layer of community-driven oversight to the protocol.\n\nMetaMorpho, on the other hand, introduces the concept of lending vaults, which are managed by third-party 'risk experts.' In this layer, lenders deposit their funds into a vault, and the vault manager is responsible for allocating this liquidity across various Morpho Blue markets. This approach allows for a more sophisticated and dynamic management of funds, leveraging the expertise of specialized managers to optimize returns and manage risks. The core innovation of MetaMorpho lies in its product standpoint and developer-friendliness. It creates a platform where third-party developers can build on top of Morpho Blue infrastructure, adding an additional layer of versatility and innovation to the Morpho ecosystem.\n\nSteakhouse Financial Case Study\n\nSteakhouse Financial, led by Sebventures, stands as a prime example of how the Morpho Blue ecosystem can be leveraged effectively. This crypto-native financial advisory for DAOs has made significant strides in the DeFi space with its innovative approach to lending. Since January 3, Steakhouse Financial has been managing a USDC MetaMorpho vault with a TVL of $12.8M. This vault is focused on primarily stETH and wBTC. In the future, Steakhouse has expressed interest in supporting Real-World Assets (RWAs) collateral.\n\nThe Four Actors in Morpho’s Ecosystem\n\nThere are four primary factors in the Morpho Ecosystem given its current development: MetaMorpho lenders, Morpho Blue Lenders, borrowers, MetaMorpho vault managers, and Morpho governance / Morpho labs (kinda the same rn… i think)\n\nBelow is an updated visual of the complete Morpho protocol architecture , annotating the actors and their objectives / thought process\n\nMorpho Growth Playbook\n\nMorpho has distinguished itself through a blend of powerful branding and business development execution excellence. While other lending projects have come about, including Ajna, Midas, Frax Lend, and Silo Finance, Morpho has risen to the top in terms of TVL traction. The protocol, while inherently permissionless, is abstracted away with a permissioned Morpho UI. This curated user interface is a testament to the team’s commitment to maintaining a brand synonymous with trust, by selectively showcasing only the best lending markets and partners. This nuanced approach - selling the allure of a permissionless protocol while effectively gating its frontend to highly reputable entities - ensures that Morpho Blue is a beacon for quality and reliability within a DeFi space that can seem risky and unstable. \n\nBuilding upon the previous points, Morpho has invested a great amount of time and energy in the end user experience. Morpho has developed a clean and intuitive UI/UX, streamlining the interaction for end users and lending operators alike. This is not the case for many DeFi lending protocols that still give off a gimmicky vibe. Furthermore the development of abstraction layers such as MetaMorpho,  simplifies the appeal. Morpho Blue's nuanced strategy of balancing permissionless innovation with a permissioned, brand-centric frontend is impressive. This approach not only underlines the adaptability and flexibility of Morpho as a platform but also positions it as a leader in fostering specialized and secure lending solutions in the DeFi arena.\n\nWhat has Morpho done well? What needs improvement?\n\nGood: Strong personal branding of team members such as Paul and Merlin, enhancing credibility and visibility.\n\nGood: Effective ecosystem building by selling the simplicity, building abstraction layers like MetaMorpho and locking in 3rd party lending operators like Steakhouse, B Protocol, Block Analitica, and Re7 and locking in token incentives (e.g stETH) for select lending markets.\n\nGood: Strong existing product and branding from its optimizer product, which provides great leverage for Morpho Blue to succeed.\n\nNeeds Improvement: Unit economics for 3rd party risk managers needs improvement. Block Analitica at $45M AUM yields a $70k revenue, without taking into engineering costs, legal costs, and risk management costs.\n\nAjna, Oracle-Free Markets\n\nAjna’s Origins\n\nAjna was founded by several ex-MakerDAO team members who recognized the scalability and risk issues in previous generation borrowing and lending protocols. Oracle dependency and Governance were both limiting factors for growth and major sources of risk. The key idea was to outsource the Oracle functionality to the lenders and liquidators themselves. The vision was to create the Uniswap of borrowing and lending, an immutable protocol that can scalably support virtually all assets, including long tail assets and NFTs. The original and innovative design came about as a result of over two years of development that included over ten code audits.\n\nThe origin story of Ajna Finance is deeply intertwined with the broader desire for security and robustness within the DeFi ecosystem in 2023. This is highlighted by Dan Elizter’s article on the need for oracle-free protocols in DeFi (read here). Elitzer, founder of Nascent VC and a prominent figure in the DeFi community, outlines the persistent security challenges plaguing DeFi and the billions lost to hacks, stressing the necessity for a fundamental rethinking of DeFi protocol design and security. \n\nThe Ajna Protocol emerges as a compelling solution in this context. Launched in mid-July of 2023, Ajna’s design philosophy aligns with Elitzer’s vision of what he describes as a true DeFi primitive: a protocol that operates with zero dependencies such that it is trustless, including the absence of governance, upgradeability and oracles. This type of approach reduces the theoretical attack surface and inherent risks within a protocol. \n\nAjna - Protocol Analysis\n\nAjna stands out in the DeFi landscape for its unique approach to lending and borrowing. It is a non-custodial, permissionless system that operates without the need for oracles or governance, ensuring a high degree of decentralization and autonomy. Ajna allows for the creation of markets with a specific collateral and loan asset, simplifying the process and enhancing user accessibility. The platform supports a wide array of assets, including both fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), thereby expanding the scope of collateral types beyond what is typically seen in DeFi. Ajna’s distinctive features include the facilitation of unique borrowing cases like NFT borrowing and shorting markets, without the common limitations of other platforms. \n\nThe Three Actors in Ajna’s Ecosystem\n\nThere are three primary factors in the Morpho Ecosystem given its current development: Ajna lenders, Ajna borrowers, Ajna governance / tokenholders.\n\nAjna Growth Playbook\n\nFollowing a significant security bug in the latter half of 2023, Ajna took a clear hit in its security-oriented brand. Following the relaunch, the project has returned with the pursuit of complete decentralization, severing any ties with a centralized labs company. Now, they are a fully decentralized DAO and protocol. \n\nRebooting DeFi protocols is tough, and it’s never a good look. While Ajna has experienced a setback, they’ve come back with a re-audited (5x) protocol that has two clear selling points: fully decentralized and oracle-less. Ajna’s playbook is leaning completely into the DeFi-native brand.\n\nNow, the longer term questions are the following:\n\nWhat lending use cases does Ajna uniquely unlock that allows it to be differentiated from Morpho and other competitors?\n\nHow effective will decentralized DAO coordination work out for Ajna as they try to execute their growth and BD playbook?\n\nEuler, Rising From The Shadows\n\nEuler’s Origins\n\nThe Euler Protocol, emerging as a next-generation DeFi lending platform, represents a significant evolution from first-generation protocols like Compound and Aave. Established as a decentralized service, Euler addresses a critical gap in the DeFi market: the lack of support for non-mainstream tokens in lending and borrowing services. Recognizing the unmet demand for borrowing and lending long-tail crypto assets, Euler offers a permissionless platform where almost any token can be listed, as long as it is paired with WETH on Uniswap v3.\n\nThe Euler Protocol distinguishes itself in the DeFi lending space through several key innovations:\n\nIt employs a unique risk assessment approach that considers both collateral and borrow factors for assets, enhancing the accuracy of risk evaluation.\n\nEuler also integrates Uniswap v3’s decentralized TWAP oracles for asset valuation, supporting its permissionless ethos by enabling diverse asset listings.\n\nFurthermore, the protocol introduces a novel liquidation mechanism resistant to MEV attacks and a reactive interest rate model that adjusts autonomously to market conditions.\n\nThese features, along with the implementation of sub-accounts for user convenience, position Euler as a sophisticated and adaptable platform in DeFi lending.\n\nUnfortunately, on March 13 of 2023, Euler Finance would experience one of the largest DeFi hacks ever. The March 13 flash loan attack led to losses exceeding $195 million and triggered a contagion effect, impacting numerous decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Beyond Euler, at least 11 other protocols suffered losses as a result of the attack.\n\nPost-hack: Euler V2\n\nAfter a silent year, Euler returned with its v2 as of February 22, 2024. Euler v2 is a modular lending platform with two primary components: Euler Vault Kit (EVK) and Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC). The EVK enables developers to create their own customized lending vaults; it can be described as a vault development kit that makes it easier to spin up vaults with Euler’s opinionated tech framework. The EVC is an interoperability protocol that enables vault creators to connect their vaults together such that they developers can more efficiently chain vaults together to pass information and interact with one another. Together, these two technologies act as base layer lending infrastructure.\n\nThere will be two primary types of Euler vaults\n\nCore: Governed lending markets similar to Euler v1, managed by the DAO\n\nEdge: Permissionless lending markets with greater flexibility of parameters. Pooled lending experience rather than 1:1 like Morpho Blue or Ajna\n\nEuler’s Branding Strategy\n\nSimilar to Ajna and Morpo, Euler is leaning heavily into the “modular” lending narrative, seeking to build a permissionless base layer lending protocol that 3rd parties can come and utilize. However, Euler differs significantly in its public-facing marketing and branding. Unlike Morpho, which has taken an incredibly abstracted and simplified approach, Euler leans heavily into its feature-rich technology as key selling points of the brand and technology. Some of the features that it highlights are advanced risk management tools like sub-accounts, PnL simulators, limit order types, new liquidation mechanisms (fee flow), and more. \n\nWho is Euler’s end user and what is their end product? \n\nEuler offers an incredibly powerful feature set and novel features that surpasses Morpho Blue (e.g sub-accounts, Fee Flow, PnL simulators, and more). The question remains: is Euler selling its lending infrastructure to 3rd party lending operators or are they spinning out their own lending markets? These are two very different opportunities with a different set of customers. If Euler is competing with Morpho to attract 3rd party lending operators, how easy is it to build abstractions on top of Euler v2? Euler misses the notion of a \"pool manager\" abstraction primitive equivalent to MetaMorpho, yet they seem to want to replicate what Morpho is doing with 3rd party pool operators.\n\nIs the 1% protocol fee a good idea at launch?\n\nAt launch, Euler is enforcing a minimum 1% protocol fee derived from the vault governor. This can be a significant mental blocker, as fees are killers in a growth phase. On the other hand, Morpho has a pact where their business source license terms are connected to the fee mechanism: if the fee is charged the code becomes open source (and therefore free to fork). \n\nMoving Forward\n\nAs the lending landscape seems to achieve maturity relative to other more novel aspects of DeFi like liquid staking and retaking, one is likely to question where the innovation lies and what might lie ahead for one of DeFi’s more established sectors. However, to argue that lending is one of the only areas in DeFi that has achieved true product market fit in a way that has (for the most part) avoided ponzi-nomics would be a fair argument to make. This is to say that the innovation will almost inevitably follow where the product-market-fit lies, so if the past can be any indicator of the future, lending in DeFi is sure to see evolution in the coming cycles.\n\nThroughout this paper, we have discussed multiple new primitives in the lending space from companies including Ajna, Morpho, and Euler. The overarching theme of all three of these new lending primitives is not only permissionless market creation but also permissionless market creation in a user-friendly, user-centric way. Yes, prior to these three protocols, one could spin up one’s own lending pool/protocol, but it was not user-friendly. In this next cycle of DeFi lending, we are keeping an eye not only on the permissionless side (which seems to be the obvious direction that protocols are trending) but also the user-experience side. Companies like Summer.fi are creating new lending experiences (and DeFi experiences at large) to allow for a simpler DeFi experience. These will likely continue to gain traction as their integrations increase, and their experience becomes simpler than going directly to the frontends hosted by the creators of various lending protocols. As the focused on intent-based protocols rise, intent-based lending or borrowing (in a similar way to how Morpho aggregates between Aave and Compound) could prove to be another future primitive in lending: just input what you want to borrow, and this new primitive will find the best, risk-adjusted opportunity. \n\nIn a similar vein, creating a market in a permissionless manner is sure to become simpler as well. Currently, Morpho is engaging with three sophisticated parties (B Protocol, Block Analitica, and Steakhouse Finance) to operate their new permissionless markets, but soon this, too, like the lending experience itself, which is already permissionless, will become more user-friendly for any user to accomplish. This ability for any user to create a market will allow for a Cambrian explosion of innovation in lending with everything from new asset types as collateral (assets like LRTs, RWAs, etc) to new structured products focused on various yield opportunities. Many of these markets will surely fail, but the robust nature of the underlying protocols will eliminate cross-contamination, allowing the market to determine winning and losing markets.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://docs.morpho.org/\n\nhttps://faqs.ajna.finance/getting-started/welcome\n\nhttps://docs.euler.finance/\n\nNot financial or tax advice. The purpose of this newsletter is purely educational and should not be considered as investment advice, legal advice, a request to buy or sell any assets, or a suggestion to make any financial decisions.

In a world where we have one monolithic blockchain, all value accrues to this blockchain’s ecosystem — but that’s not the case with modular blockchains.\n\nThis is due to the inherent design of these modular blockchains. Modularity as it relates to core blockchain components (data availability and consensus; why there’s a grouping of these two will be touched upon later in this post; execution, and settlement) is different layers specialize (do what they’re best at), and the best layers for data availability and consensus, settlement, and execution are coupled into one blockchain, which when presented to the end user, allows them to get a better product at a lower price. Elaborating on this, the modular stack’s main benefit materializes with users being able to access cheaper blockspace and better blockspace (better in the sense that this specialization allows for total blockspace to expand exponentially; more on this below; as more blockchains proliferate, unlocking applications that we haven’t even thought of yet — much like how broadband unlocked social media for us), as well as better security guarantees. Developers of applications also need to worry less about the ideal stack for them; they can just plug and play, subsequently deploying their app. So when the functions of all these core components are carried out by different blockchains, where exactly does value accrue?\n\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

One reason the modular blockchain narrative is going to be instrumental for the paradigm shift into blockchain technology and Web 3.0, in general, is that it allows us to scale bandwidth without compromising on the whole reasons blockchains are so interesting — their properties of censorship resistance, liveness, and credible neutrality.\n\nScalability with Modular Blockchains\n\nIn essence, with modular blockchains, we can try to make the best trade-offs on the blockchain trilemma (as seen above) by scaling in layers. Take Ethereum as an example. With modular blockchains, Ethereum can be used as a settlement layer as it has the most amount of validators and the most geographically distributed set of validators (as well as a lot of solo stakers and overall less cloud concentration, see here), as well as being secured by, objectively, the best crypto money after bitcoin, Ether. But, effectively, Ethereum is well suited to be a settlement layer, which would make it a place to have the canonical bridge, as well as have dispute resolution (like for fraud/fault proofs). \n\nNow, with regard to scalability, we do this on layers built on top of Ethereum, much like we do in TradFi (for example, Stripe or something like PayPal is built on top of many financial layers, and usually banks, say every week or so, settle up on the base layer using Fedwire, i.e., the Federal Reserve settlement system) — Nic Carter, in this episode with Lex Fridman, breaks it down well (it is worth noting that TradFi is at an advantage since TradFi utilizes centralized databases to record transfers, etc., while blockchains are distributed ledgers that require cooperation of thousands of nodes to append and verify). This takes the form of rollups (and other scaling solutions, rollups being the predominant one), which solely specialize in execution (execution is basically just running code in an execution environment, which takes the form of the EVM for Ethereum and Ethereum rollups), and can hence make some trade-offs when it comes to decentralization and security (this is also another post in and of itself). Rollups also need data availability (primer here) and, by extension, consensus in order to function, and while those can be done by Ethereum, it can be outsourced (tradeoffs here, too) also to blockchains like Celestia, which specialize in it (this video gives you a high-level overview of Celestia)\n\nA nice example of a project embracing modularity is Eclipse, which uses Ethereum as a settlement layer and Celestia as a DA+consensus layer and does execution by itself using the SVM (Solana virtual machine) as its execution environment. The SVM is creating a lot of buzz right now for being one of the only multithreaded virtual machines, allowing for parallelization (basically transactions to be processed in parallel to each other), unlike the Ethereum virtual machine, which is single-threaded; hence, sequential transactions are the norm and parallelization is not possible.\n\n\nModular or Monolithic?\n\n\nLet me caveat all this by saying that Ethereum in and of itself is not a modular blockchain, in the sense that it can do everything (data availability, consensus, execution, and settlement) by itself, but it can be used by other blockchains and layers of the modular stack (for example, execution layers like rollups) for functions like settlement, which then makes Ethereum a component of another project’s modular stack. This is where this meme from Jon Charb, who has done some amazing writing on Ethereum’s roadmap and Ethereum rollups, comes from. The way this meme can be understood is that everything is a modular blockchain, and everything is a monolithic blockchain (doing all the functions on the base layer, like Solana), depending on how you look at it. For example, if I built a rollup on Solana, is Solana itself a monolithic blockchain or a modular one? Likewise, for Ethereum. Even Celestia can do execution and settlement too, but if it’s only utilized for data availability and consensus, then it's a modular blockchain — you get the point.\n\nBy embracing modular blockchains, you can have different blockchains that specialize in what they do to fulfill the requirements to have an “optimized” blockchain, as I’ve elucidated above.\n\nBut that begs the question, which one of these layers (data availability/DA for short, consensus, settlement, execution) will capture the most amount of value (have the most value accrual)?\n\n\nThis post was provoked after discovering this Tweet\n\nand these are the conclusions and frameworks that I have drawn from it (spoiler alert - I disagree with the Tweet).\n\nTo formalize my thinking more concisely:\n\n1) For a DA layer to work, you need some kind of ordering on that layer (hence, DA layers come with their own consensus, i.e., ordering protocols), so in this modular stack, consensus and DA are not two separate things — just imagine using data available on one chain in order to create proofs but this data (because it's on a blockchain) is ordered in some other way by another chain — it’s just a mess.\n\n2) Execution layers like Arbitrum have pricing (discrimination) power, whilst DA layers like Celestia do not. This is because Celestia provides a homogeneous service (data availability), while Arbitrum (and other rollups like Optimism; I’m just taking Arbitrum as a main example) provides an execution environment for some of the best crypto apps not found elsewhere — this in itself is the reason why Arbitrum makes a significant amount of revenue (somethings hundreds of thousands of dollars a day) while Celestia makes negligible fees, less than $100 per day at the time of writing, as seen below (but this is also a function of Celestia’s nascency). Arbitrum is also closer to the end user due to the monopoly on sequencing they have (the foundation runs the only sequencer), and while this will change in the future (like for example with the adoption of shared sequencing), the Arbitrum protocol (sequencer, builder, searcher) will still be the only ones to receive user fees, and most importantly, MEV and some part of the fees will trickle down to DA layer as the rollup/execution environment will still write the data to Celestia, etc.! And remember, if DA layers captured most of the value, then rollups today would be charging lower fees to users than cost to post/write data to the DA layer (i.e., operating at a loss, which is not the case today).\n\nAnatoly Yakovenko (the founder of Solana) explains this phenomena in-depth on the Lightspeed podcast.\n\n3) Settlement layers are more valuable than DA+consensus layers (and I’d argue execution layers) simply because of the fact that the settlement layer will be secured by the most money/money-like crypto asset, as in the case of the most credibly neutral settlement layer today, Ethereum, being secured by $ETH. DA+consensus layers will inevitably have more activity/volume flowing through it relative to the settlement layer (which will only be used for bridging and dispute resolution, so occasionally, block headers will be posted to it from the DA+consensus layer), but the settlement layer’s asset will still be more valuable albeit the settlement layer “doing less.” Just look at $TRX vs. $ETH; the former’s blockchain does more volume and burns more of its native token than Ethereum has volume and burns its native token, yet its valued magnitudes less than $ETH — what gives? Exactly. Monetary premiums.\n\nSimply put, the monetary premium is a multiple an asset trades at relative to its fundamentals/fundamental utility due to its “moneyness.” Gold is a good example, wherein it's really not so used in the economy for production processes, and yes, it also looks good, but most of its value comes from its hard money trait — case in point. H/T to Polynya for this point, who puts it better than I do, as seen below.\n\nSo where does that leave us? \n\nThis is what I think: the most valuable part of the stack is settlement, then execution, and then DA+consensus, for all the reasons mentioned above (and why I’m not delineating between DA and consensus). \n\nMy argument can be summed up as follows: settlement layer is the most valuable because of monetary premiums, and execution is much more valuable than DA+consensus because the latter provides a homogenous service where competition is fierce, and costs (and hence revenue for the DA+consensus layer) will trend to 0 (slightly unrelated, but this talk by Peter Thiel is great and talks about why these sorts of businesses don’t make sense to pursue), whilst the former (execution) can build network effects at a much greater rate and solidify them with mass liquidity! They’re also much closer to the users and do not compete on fees!\n\nLet me explain this point a little more. Right now, rollups like Optimism and Arbitrum pay more than 90% of their costs (which are actually paid by users) for DA costs (this Bell Curve episode expands on what I’m saying), and want to minimize this. So they might switch to Celestia for DA (and hence consensus), and hence lower the cost (and therefore their revenue) drastically (right now, data on Celestia costs pennies for rollups; if Arbitrum wrote as much data as it did today to Ethereum to Celestia, it would only pay a few thousand dollars — Dan Smith has done good research on this). But users don’t care about small fee increments between rollups! I don’t care if I’m paying $0.01 for a swap on rollup A when I could be paying $0.007 for a swap on rollup B, simply because I don’t swap that much, and bridging my assets is a hurdle and entails security risks! But for a rollup, which is, after all, a business posting thousands of megabytes of data to the DA layer, these “increments” in cost matter a lot because they add up. Basically, rollups are price elastic, like very price elastic. But rollup users aren’t, to a large degree.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom fat protocols to fat applications, modeling value accrual in the blockchain landscape is not a new endeavor. The advent of modularity introduces new components to the public blockchain landscape, and thus new economic and value dynamics as well. Modular blockchains represent a paradigm shift in the blockchain stack - from building a complete integrated network that can serve all 4 blockchain functions on the base layer, to building networks which use specialized layers for fulfilling these functions as optimally as possible.\n\nTo reiterate, I believe that the settlement layer is the most valuable component of the stack, underpinned by the monetary premiums associated with the underlying asset. execution layers follow closely behind. In contrast though, DA+consensus layers, despite providing essential functions, face growing competition and diminishing revenue potential due to their semblance to commodities.\n\nIn short, the order of value accrual in the modular stack:\n\nSettlement > Execution > DA + Consensus\n\nNot financial or tax advice. The purpose of this newsletter is purely educational and should not be considered as investment advice, legal advice, a request to buy or sell any assets, or a suggestion to make any financial decisions.

The primary point of contention has always revolved around whether individuals are drawn to technology and innovations or to memes and speculation. However, now both groups can coexist and find value within the Berachain Blockchain.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nSubscribe\n\nOn one hand, Berachain offers a novel consensus mechanism that optimizes liquidity performance while remaining EVM-compatible. This is achieved through the Polaris modular EVM framework, providing the execution environment for smart contracts on Berachain. On the other hand, the project's anonymous developer team, creators of a bear-themed project, has successfully raised $420 million at its latest valuation. This, in itself, is an exciting feat fueled by memetic appeal. While most memes merely serve as fodder for speculation, Berachain strives to bridge the gap between hype and substance, offering the best of both worlds: memes and technology.\n\nIn this article, we will delve deeper into the Berachain Ecosystem, exploring the unique culture it has fostered, its history, and the technology powering this innovative narrative.\n\nChain Ethos\n\nIt is no secret that the Berachain community is one of the most recognizable and enthusiastic among all communities. You won't find as many people on Twitter being avid fans of Bera, its updates, memes, and more. But how did it become this way?\n\nThe answer lies in the concept of a cult. In medieval times, cults played crucial roles in power struggles. Originally, \"cult\" referred to those who glorified a saint, but now it signifies ancient or primitive religious practices. There's a narrative suggesting that cults thrive in bear markets. The Link (Chainlink) marines, with their frog pfps, memes, and low entry barriers, exemplify this. In the Berachain ecosystem, cult dynamics extend beyond JPEG prices, contributing to its growth.\n\nCore contributors of Bera drive collaborative intelligence, while the larger community contributes vital collective intelligence through ideas, comments, memes, and unique creativity. This fusion historically makes open source communities vibrant. All cult (community) members benefit from the success of the cult; moreover, they are all a financial part of the cult. The key thing is that cultists don't have a single portrait—whether you are the smartest developer in the world or a GM poster, you're still a part of the cult.\n\nBecause Bera drives the memetic culture, everything not related to the technology is considered a meme. So even if FUD starts, Bera can still benefit from that.\n\nDespite debates over technical merit, the crypto space tends to favor meme coins. BERA, a coin with real use cases and various benefits, enters this landscape with a distinctive presence.\n\nLabeling Berachain merely as a meme with a cult following would significantly underestimate its significance. Consider the narratives that Crypto Twitter likes – well, Berachain has them all. Now, let's delve into the various technical innovations taking place within the Berachain ecosystem.\n\nTechnology behind Berachain\n\nBerachain stands as a high-performance blockchain compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), employing the innovative Proof-of-Liquidity consensus mechanism. This novel approach in consensus aims to align network incentives, fostering synergy between Berachain validators and the ecosystem of projects. The technological foundation of Berachain is established on Polaris, a cutting-edge blockchain framework designed for constructing EVM-compatible chains, leveraging the CometBFT consensus engine.\n\nBerachain is built on top of the Cosmos-SDK, which encompasses identical tooling and operations. Moreover, it incorporates additional functionalities embedded within the chain, specifically tailored to optimize for proof-of-liquidity. Furthermore, Berachain utilizes Polaris EVM, which was specifically designed by the team themselves to easily separate the EVM runtime layer to develop stateful precompiles and custom modules that can be used to create more efficient smart contracts.\n\nPrecompiles\n\nPrecompiles, also known as precompiled contracts, constitute a distinctive class of smart contracts with functionalities directly integrated into the EVM, rather than executing as bytecode. Each precompile is assigned a specific address, and the associated gas fees for executing these contracts are predetermined. In the context of Berachain, this mechanism is primarily employed to facilitate enhanced functionality on the chain, enabling direct interaction with various Cosmos modules that would otherwise be inaccessible outside the EVM. Berachain's precompiles incorporate certain EVM precompile contracts from Polaris, with some additional ones to enhance functionality further.\n\nProof-of-Liquidity\n\nThe economic model of Berachain represents an innovative approach to blockchain governance, seeking to address the pivotal challenges encountered by decentralized networks. This model centers around three objectives:\n\nLiquidity Building\n\nStake Decentralization\n\nAligning protocols and validators\n\nProof of Liquidity builds on top of the classic Proof of Stake mechanism to address the problems usually associated with PoS Networks: stake centralization, almost no opportunity to improve the security of the chain, and little incentives for validators. Let's walk through it.\n\nUsers can earn BGT, the Bera Governance Token used for Proof of Liquidity delegation, by supplying liquidity to the BEX liquidity pools. Subsequently, users delegate their BGT to validators. With block production determined by the proportionate weight of BGT delegated to them, validators generate rewards for both delegators and themselves from the chain. Furthermore, validators participate in voting on future BGT inflation across various liquidity pools, and any bribes are distributed from validators to their delegators (if created by the validator).\n\nFrom the chart above and the architecture of Berachain, we can describe how PoL solves the problems of PoS blockchains.\n\nProof of Liquidity tackles the initial challenge of Proof of Stake through two key mechanisms:\n\nSeparating the delegation token (BGT) from the chain's gas token (BERA).\n\nRestricting the acquisition of new BGT to provide liquidity to the BEX.\n\nThis implies that the staking token is distinct from the token utilized for various on-chain activities. Moreover, the exclusive method for earning new governance tokens involves contributing to liquidity, thereby incentivizing additional liquidity provision.\n\nProof of Liquidity effectively addresses the second issue associated with Proof of Stake by distributing newly minted BGT to liquidity providers. Unlike traditional Proof of Stake networks where stakers directly receive the new stake, Proof of Liquidity allocates it to separate market participants engaged in common on-chain actions. This results in a more equitable distribution of token inflation.\n\nLastly, Proof of Liquidity encourages protocols and validators to collaborate. This collaboration is incentivized to have validators promote a protocol's LP pool through BGT and enable protocols to assist validators in accumulating BGT stake through bribes.\n\nTri-token Model\n\nThe Berachain Token Model consists of 3 tokens: $BERA, $BGT, $HONEY.\n\nBERA: native token of Berachain a.k.a. Gas token\n\nBGT: governance token\n\nHONEY: native stablecoin\n\nWhile $BERA and $HONEY serve rather intuitive roles, BGT is not nearly as straightforward. Why is there a need separate tokens for gas and governance after all?\n\nBGT Management\n\nBGT is non-transferrable and can only be acquired through three ways:\n\nProviding liquidity to the native BEX (Berachain DEX) for an LP pair that receives BGT emissions\n\nBorrowing HONEY on Bend (Berachain Lending)\n\nProviding HONEY in the bHONEY vault for Berps (Berachain Perps)\n\nUpon obtaining BGT, users proceed to delegate it to validators within the network. The stake weight of a validator's BGT is instrumental in determining two key aspects:\n\nThe proportion of blocks a validator is responsible for producing among all validators\n\nThe percentage of future BGT emissions that they can influence through their voting\n\nWhen BGT is delegated to a validator, it becomes eligible for initiating and voting on governance proposals. These proposals may include decisions on the allocation of BGT emissions to specific LP pools. Delegating BGT also triggers the commencement of various rewards from the network.\n\nAdditionally, BGT has the option to be burned at a 1:1 ratio for BERA. It's essential to note that this process is unidirectional, and BERA cannot be converted back into BGT.\n\nThe amount of BGT inflation a validator has control over is determined by the amount of BGT delegated to them. Let's consider a scenario where you function as a validator with 10% of the entire staked BGT delegated to you. With a 10% stake of BGT assigned to you, you effectively manage influence over the direction of 10% of forthcoming BGT inflation. Specifically, this BGT inflation is directed toward the native BEX liquidity pools, allowing you to determine which LP pools are incentivized for users to deposit tokens. This typically results in increased liquidity within those pools.\n\nProtocol Rewards\n\nProof of Liquidity produces rewards for holders of BGT. These rewards stem from diverse on-chain activities and are allocated to BGT holders in accordance with the amount of BGT they have delegated. There are three types of rewards: BGT Inflation, Block Captured Value, and Gas Fees.\n\nNew BGT is generated in every block, determined by Berachain's inflation rate. These newly created BGT units are allocated to the liquidity providers in specific BEX pools. The distribution is based on the total amount of new BGT emissions voted upon by validators during the current epoch.\n\nBlock Captured Value is the fees from Berachain's native DApps, namely BEX, Honey, and Perps. Transactions within each of these DApps may trigger fees, which are designated as the Block Captured Value (BCV). Whenever a validator incorporates a transaction in their block that incurs a fee, they receive that fee as a reward. Validators receive a percentage of the BCV as a commission, and the remaining portion is distributed to BGT delegators.\n\nHistory and Fundraising\n\nThe story of Berachain's origins is quite unique and involves a journey from meme-fueled NFTs to potentially one of the most unique Layer 1s. It all began with an NFT collection called BongBears, launched in August 2021 by three pseudonymous co-founders: Dev Bear, Papa Bear, and Smokey the Bera. The Bong Bears mint on August 27th, 2021, featured 100 Beras, priced at 0.069 ETH each. The mint process was unique, allowing buyers to view and choose specific bears on OpenSea before purchase.\n\nDuring that period, the team drew inspiration from the emerging rebasing protocol, OlympusDAO, which was quickly gaining popularity in the crypto community. Taking notes from OlympusDAO, Bong Bears pioneered the creation of a unique collection of rebasing NFTs, paving the way for subsequent collections. These \"zooted\" cartoon bears quickly gained traction in the crypto community. The BongBears project wasn't just about art; it served as the first stage in a series of bear-themed NFT collections, including Bond Bears, Boo Bears, Baby Bears, Band Bears, and Bit Bears. Each iteration is built upon the previous one.\n\nOn October 16th, 2021, OG Bong Bear holders received an airdrop of a rebasing NFT, the Bond Bear, making Bong Bears the first rebasing NFTs ever. \n\nOn October 29, 2021, The Boo Bears rebase brought 271 festive bears celebrating Halloween in style. Notably, some bears featured costumes representing popular protocols like TempleDAO and Rome.\n\nThe Baby Bears collection, dropping on December 16, 2021, just in time for the holidays, introduced 571 babies. Many featured Christmas and holiday themes, adding to the festive spirit. However, a hidden twist awaited – each bera from previous collections had a corresponding baby version, creating a quest for owners to reunite \"families.\"\n\nThe Band Bears, a delightful collection of 1,175 beras released on April 20, 2022. Each musical bera was styled after a musician, providing a compelling incentive for users to trade for beras that suited their taste. Wild OTC trades, like Johnny Cash for Bob Dylan or Future for George Michael, became common. Both OG and baby versions were available for each artist, allowing collectors to pursue both variants.\n\nThe next rebera, the stealth drop of 2,355 Bit Bears by Berachain on August 24, 2022, surprised the community. This batch featured a distinct art style, swapping Papa Bear's designs for pixelated little beras by PixelBera.\n\nSource\n\nFew NFT projects venture into L1, seed an ecosystem with a dedicated community, and achieve this without marketing expenses.It’s hard to  imagine that an anonymous team starting from an NFT collection at the end of 2021 would raise a round with an incredible valuation of $420M 2 years later,  led by one of the top funds in the industry in Polychain. Other investors included Shima Capital, dao5, Hack VC, Robot Ventures, Tribe Capital, GoldenTree Asset Management, and others.\n\nSome of the most notable angels include Mustafa Al-Bassam (co-founder of Celestia), Zaki Manian (co-founder of Tendermint), Georgios Vlachos (co-founder of Axelar), and others.\n\nEcosystem\n\nBerachain is a relatively new entrant in the blockchain world, and, of course, it cannot be directly compared to well-established ecosystems like Ethereum or Layer 2 Protocols. However, some of its projects play a foundational role in ensuring the proper implementation of the Proof-of-Liquidity Consensus Mechanism. Let's explore three of the most promising ones.\n\nInfrared\n\nInfrared is a liquid staking solution built on top of  Proof-of-Liquidity within the Berachain ecosystem. The user experience enabled by Infrared stands out by introducing BGT liquidity, simplifying the bribe and validator layer, and streamlining the distribution of BGT.\n\nInfrared makes accessing the Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) ecosystem easy and open for everyone. With a focus on user-friendliness, it provides a straightforward platform for liquidity providers to earn iBGT — Infrared’s liquid version of BGT. \n\nLiquidity providers on Berachain native DApps and other BGT-eligible venues can earn trading fees, native emissions, and claim liquid iBGT . Infrared has no deposit or withdrawal fees and a minimal performance fee, distributed among $IRED holders. Through iBGT, Infrared aims to pioneer use cases for BGT that previously weren’t possible on Berachain. They're Supported by the Berachain Foundation and the Build-a-Bera incubator program, aiming to become the leading network of validators.\n\nKodiak\n\nKodiak is a liquidity hub on Berachain that brings concentrated liquidity and automated liquidity management to the ecosystem. It is suitable for both traders and LPs. To have a better understanding of Kodiak, it's essential to know that its architecture allows vertical integration of different DEX Layers. Let's explore all of them.\n\nSource\n\nKodiak DEX, a decentralized exchange, offers users a non-custodial and highly capital-efficient trading and liquidity provision experience utilizing both concentrated and full-range AMMs.\n\nKodiak Islands, automated concentrated liquidity strategy vaults, are primarily used to attract liquidity in the Berachain Ecosystem. Kodiak Islands automate LP strategies with concentrated liquidity provision. User deposits create a concentrated liquidity range that automatically rebalances to stay 'in-range' with price movements. Kodiak Island LP positions qualify for PoL BGT rewards and use BEX liquidity for rebalancing.\n\nSweetened Islands, an Integrated Incentive Layer, leverages Berachain's Proof of Liquidity (PoL) mechanism to provide sustainable incentives for liquidity on Kodiak Islands.\n\nPanda Factory, the No-Code Token Deployer Factory, streamlines the permissionless creation of new tokens, such as memecoins, and their initial liquidity on the Kodiak full-range AMM. This is particularly suitable for highly volatile assets with yet-to-be-discovered price characteristics.\n\nMoreover, Kodiak is the only DEX supported by Berachain's Build-a-Bera program. Working closely with the Berachain Foundation, Kodiak Islands are compatible with Berachain’s Proof-of-Liquidity, ensuring a flow of BGT as PoL matures.\n\nBeradrome\n\nBeradrome serves as an ecosystem incentive coordinator for Berachain, providing a unique approach to yield farming, token management, and on-chain governance. The platform introduces a tri-token structure: BERO, hiBERO, and oBERO, each offering users distinct advantages. The supply of BERO tokens is algorithmically controlled through a bonding curve mechanism, ensuring stability and market-driven liquidity.\n\nBeradrome draws inspiration from the Solidly system in its approaches to liquidity provision, rewards, and token emissions. Solidly focuses on its AMM LP tokens, deriving revenue mainly from swap fees and incentivizing veSOLID holders who vote for specific gauges to earn those fees. In contrast, Beradrome, an inclusive version of Solidly, supports any yield-bearing asset, allowing for diverse revenue streams like token emissions, swap fees, interest, or game revenue.\n\nBeradrome's main features include:\n\nBonding curve mechanism\n\nCall option emissions\n\nToken-owned Liquidity\n\nSingle-sided liquidity provisions (eliminating impermanent loss)\n\nDeep liquidity with low slippage\n\nRisk-free borrowing against hiBERO\n\nBeradrome also created an NFT collection called \"Tour de Berance.\" It is a collection of 6,900 distinctive Beras on bikes racing for liquidity on Arbitrum.\n\nSource\n\nThe Tour de Berance NFTs will provide exclusive functionality on Beradrome within the Berachain ecosystem, such as:\n\nSecuring more hiBERO allocation through NFT ownership\n\nPrivileged entry to events within the Berachain ecosystem\n\nAn NFT rebase once Berachain goes live\n\nPriority access to token sales on the Berage launchpad through whitelist inclusion\n\nAccess to the upcoming Beradrome video game\n\nTestnet Launch\n\nOn January 11, 2023, Berachain announced that its public testnet, \"Artio,\" is now live. Developers and users can interact with the faucet to receive $BERA tokens while engaging with the network and its applications. Network participants can utilize the AMM DEX, stablecoin, perpetuals exchange, and money market.\n\nCurrently, there are mainly 5 types of activities you can do on Artio Testnet:\n\nSwap tokens on BEX\n\nMint $HONEY, Berachain’s native stablecoin on Honey\n\nLend or borrow tokens on BEND\n\nTrade perpetuals on BERPS\n\nDelegate $BGT to BGT Station\n\nBerachain managed to attract 300k+ users and 1M+ transactions within the first 48 hours of launching the testnet.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this article, we delved deep into Berachain, beginning with the technology behind it and concluding with one of the most recognizable communities in crypto. Who could have imagined that the NFT collection of Bong Bears would essentially lead to the creation of Layer 1 with a novel consensus mechanism, raising a round at a $420M valuation? Currently, we are witnessing a multitude of protocols beginning development on Berachain, along with impressive statistics from the testnet launch. Berachain accomplishes two remarkable feats: establishing a strong community that supports \"beras'' and implementing a well-designed and proposed architecture for the protocol. The combination of these two factors makes Berachain one of the most unique Layer 1 projects in the current crypto market.\n\nSources\n\nA Deep Dive into Berachain\n\nhttps://medium.com/@itsdevbear/introducing-berachain-4f7dc3032c17\n\nBerachain\n\nBerachain Docs\n\nhttps://twitter.com/miguelrare/status/1745886186080485862\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dylanxvfeth/status/1745176859728560131?s=52&t=txFAbiSPTdLLDlAYj9X_AA\n\n[Research] Introducing Berachain\n\nBerachain Unleashed: Liquidity Redefined\n\nBerachain, Cults and the Dawn of The Honey Jar\n\nHoney Jar Ponzinomics\n\nIntroducing Kodiak: Berachain’s Native Liquidity Hub\n\nBeradrome Docs\n\nIntroducing: Infrared.

Not a priest” \n\nRestaking \n\nFollowing the Shapella upgrade which enabled withdrawals for ETH stakers, we have witnessed the rise of the liquid staking ecosystem, worth $48B today and the largest active sector in crypto today. Liquid staking tokens offer stakers opportunities to earn additional yield on their native assets, e.g. ETH, by minting a derivative asset known as a Liquid Staking Token (LST), which can be deployed across various DeFi applications to earn additional yield. \n\nRestaking is simply the process of staking an asset again after it has already been staked- the idea is to extend Ethereum’s pooled security (staked ETH) as a way to bootstrap security for new networks. It is important to distinguish between native and liquid restaking - native restaking involves staking $ETH and creating an “EigenPod“ which sets a withdrawal credential to an EigenLayer smart contract. This lets the EigenLayer system recognize your restaked amount, and one can then opt into new services written into a service contract. Liquid restaking enables LST holders to “stake their stake” and receive a derivative token to represent their restaking position called an LRT. For a comprehensive overview of the liquid restaking frontier, see Shoal’s research report. \n\nOverall, restaking introduces a new layer of yield for the asset holder, more security for the underlying network in theory, and certainly more risk depending on who you ask. Excitement around this new development is growing as there is currently over $8.9B in deposits in Eigenlayer and over $4.6B in liquid restaking protocols. \n\nThere are important risks to consider; many liquid restaking platforms have not enabled withdrawals yet, so exercise caution as you are depositing into a one-way contract at the time. Read the latest Shoal report for a comprehensive overview of the risks of current liquid restaking platforms. Furthermore, it will be important to ensure the restaking strategy marketplace does not converge to create a new layer of centralization risk at the staking operator level. \n\nThat said, with a healthy dose of caution, we expect restaking protocols to perform well in 2024. \n\nEigenlayer - Having pioneered restaking, Eigenlayer is the key layer to enabling restaking strategies. The protocol has already accrued more deposits (TVL) than Uniswap and could easily overthrow Aave and Maker (#3 and #2 respectively) by the end of the year if not within the next few months. There is an airdrop coming, so it will be interesting to see how user retention and outflows normalize following the release of the token. While a decline in TVL and users is expected, the question is to which extent and for how long, as this will provide valuable insight for forming long-term convictions around the potential for Eigenlayer and the restaking ecosystem.\n\nEtherfi  -  Etherfi enables users to deposit ETH to be natively restaked with Eigenlayer. The protocol has the highest value of deposits among all liquid restaking protocols ($1.1B) and is one of the few restaking protocols to have enabled withdrawals for users. Stakers retain custody of their ETH while delegating stake, and Etherfi mints an NFT for every validator launched through the protocol.\n\nPicasso Network ($PICA) - While restaking is native to Ethereum, it is still a young and untapped sector for which a multi-chain future seems inevitable. As restaking becomes more crowded on Ethereum, teams will explore other ecosystems and blockchains to tap into. This is already underway on Solana, which has a $1.9B liquid staking market today ripe for growth.  Picasso is a new DeFi interoperability layer from the Composable Finance team that is native to the Polkadot and Kusama network, supporting communication across multiple ecosystems via the Composable IBC module. The Solana <> IBC connection is the first AVS in the Picasso restaking layer, enabling users to stake SOL or any supported Solana LST. This unlocks a new sector of cross-chain applications and use cases between Solana and IBC-enabled chains, as other ecosystems will be able to take advantage of Solana’s speed, low fees, and growing user base and liquidity. \n\nSolana 2.0\n\nSlowly and then all at once following the FTX collapse, Solana went parabolic across all metrics in Q4 2023 around the time of the JTO airdrop and annual Breakpoint conference. We believe this is only the start. With more excitement around upcoming airdrops spurring ecosystem activity, critical infrastructure and network developments on the horizon, and continued recognition across mainstream media picking up, Solana is well-poised to do be a strong performer in the coming year and beyond. The long standing thesis is simple and contingent on Moore’s Law, as well as the notion that user-facing performance specs, like high throughput and low costs, have set up Solana to be the consumer-chain of the future. \n\nSolana recently faced a temporary network outage (2/6) after having perfect uptime for over a year. The root cause was identified to be a bug that was already fixed in testnet but still needed to be implemented on mainnet-beta. Though it is evident that outages inflict damage on Solana’s public perception, the fact is that network ultimately managed to go back up within an hour and will only become more resilient in these situations moving forward, especially with the rise of validator client diversity in the ecosystem.\n\nJupiter Exchange ($JUP) (see our thesis) \n\nFiredancer - A high performance validator client from Jump Crypto, which is expected to bring significant improvements in performance and throughput, and more importantly strengthens Solana’s validator client diversity. Read this introduction from Helius for a comprehensive introduction. \n\nKamino Finance - Simply put, Kamino aims to be the liquidity powerhouse for Solana DeFi. Users can supply/borrow with leverage, earn as an LP with automated CLMM vaults, and even long/short tokens and trade with leverage. A one-stop shop similar to Jupiter which could evolve into a competitive relationship over time as well. Furthermore, Points are live, with an airdrop expected in Q2. \n\nDePIN \n\nComputing power is a resource constantly growing in demand in today’s day and age, as the world becomes further digitized and the sheer amount of data produced continues to grow exponentially, only further accelerated with the rise of LLMs and consumer/business-centric AI. \n\nAs compute becomes an increasingly scarce resource, it becomes that much more important to optimize its distribution and availability. Decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) unlock more efficient compute markets through disintermediation of distribution and value accrual. DePIN provides a tangible and exciting use case for crypto; one that sees crypto and blockchain technology as critical components of a greater whole rather than a novel stand-alone tech with new tacky buzzwords. \n\nWhile the scope of growth for DePIN goes far beyond 2024, the sector has particularly surged in popularity in recent times. It’s important to distinguish between hype and fundamentals, but it is exciting to have a combination of the two. \n\nRender ($RNDR) - An OG GPU marketplace since 2017, connecting 3D artists to the resources they need to graphically render virtual scenes for games or movies. The platform recently migrated to Solana to join a number of leading DePIN platforms like Helium and Hivemapper. \n\nAkash ($AKASH) - The GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS?) is projected to reach over $25B by 2030, implying an inevitable strain on supply and distribution methods.  Akash is a decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplace for renting GPUs that launched as a Cosmos chain in September 2020 - think of Akash as the airbnb for GPU compute. Akash employs a hybrid architecture which handles coordination and settlement onchain, and execution off-chain. A more critical value proposition - Akash offers highly competitive rates on Nvidia A100 compared to leading providers like AWS, Azure, and more. \n\nHelium ($HNT) - Helium is a decentralized network servicing long-range, low-power communication for IoT devices like sensors, trackers, etc. Helium enables individuals to host Hotspots (mini-towers which to amplify broadband for the network) in exchange for earning rewards in Helium tokens (HNT) for their services. \n\nHivemapper ($HONEY) Decentralized Google Maps - users purchase a webcam which they then use to drive and record their surroundings, earning $HONEY tokens for contributing to building Hivemapper’s decentralized mapping system.\n\nTeleport  - TLDR; Teleport is a new decentralized ride sharing protocol. You remember the outsized returns Uber delivered its early investors. Now get this - Uber, on the blockchain. \n\nSubscribe\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

OpenAI just launched Sora, a new text > video AI model, further reminding everyone about the many capabilities of this new tech that we have yet to see. \n\nAs Lucas Tcheyan of Galaxy Research frames it - “Innovation in the two industries is unlocking new use cases that could accelerate adoption of both in the coming years.” Blockchains introduce breakthroughs in settlement, data storage, and system design (back-end) , while artificial intelligence is a revolution in computation, analysis, and content delivery (front-end). VanEck AI estimates the Crypto x AI sector could generate up to $10.2B in revenue by 2030. However, it is worth noting directly integrating AI models on blockchains is not very practical, given the limited computational capacity today. It’s entirely possible 10 years from now this may look different, but this is placing a big bet on the scalability of blockchains. \n\nHow Crypto benefits AI: \n\nCrypto provides AI with a permissionless, trustless, and composable settlement layer. \n\nUse cases include decentralized compute markets (which are already live), building AI agents programmed to execute various complex financial strategies, and developing identity and privacy solutions to combat negative externalities of AI like sybil attacks. \n\nHow AI benefits crypto: \n\nEnhanced user experience (UX) for both users and developers thanks to large-language models (i.e., specially trained versions of ChatGPT and Copilot) \n\nPotential to significantly improve smart contract functionality and automation. \n\nAccelxr of 1kx wrote a fantastic report about the different emergent areas of Crypto x AI, including creative development, anti-sybil mechanisms, infrastructure development, augmented governance, agent economies, and more. The point is, there’s a lot of potential to tap into here - but as anyone familiar with the history of the dot com bubble would say - be cautious about the trends and consequent reversals surrounding new and innovative tech that is still unproven. \n\nProjects on our watchlist \n\nBittensor ($TAO) : An open-source, decentralized blockchain network facilitating a peer-to-peer marketplace for machine intelligence. In short, Bittensor enables participants to submit AI models that can then be purchased by those who need it, e.g. app-developers and other researchers. As participants contribute their AI models and training to the Bittensor network, they are compensated in TAO tokens - given the cost inefficiencies of machine learning R&D today, one could imagine Google or IBM tapping into Bittensor’s network in the future. \n\nBittensor has 95K accounts, facilitated 292K transfers, and produced 2.3M blocks. \n\n$TAO has a market cap of roughly $4B with 89% of supply staked, and has a 21m max supply similar to Bitcoin. \n\nData from TAO explorer \n\nGet Grass - Get Grass is a protocol which aims to democratize the availability of training data for AI models, to build “the data layer for AI”. To get started, users can simply download their chrome extension to start earning points - the idea is to compensate everyday internet users for the data that is collected and sold on behalf of their digital footprint. The team has put together a data repository curated for training LLMs - something which typically comes at high costs for developers today - with the vision of empowering even everyday people to develop new applications with AI models one day, not just shady corporate overlords. Additionally, the idea of compensating people for their online data feels inevitable, and is a use case that crypto can serve perfectly as true digital-native currency.  \n\nStatistics are not currently available but are expected to come soon. \n\nNosana ($NOS) - Nosana is building a decentralized GPU marketplace for AI applications, connecting a network of user-sourced GPUs to AI developers, similar to Bittensor. Anyone with an idle consumer GPU can become a node on the Nosana network, and anyone can access Nosana’s in-house AI model for different needs. \n\nSince November 2022, Nosana has completed 180K inferences on its network, which refer to completed tasks that have been submitted to the network queue. \n\n$NOS is used for staking collateral for nodes and a medium of exchange on the Nosana network, and currently has a $370M FDV. \n\nIntents\n\nIntents have become a buzzword in crypto, and some have questioned using the term “intent” itself, but the idea is quite simple - intents are signed transactions which outsource the trade’s execution route on a user’s behalf, for the purpose of better price settlement. Whether you wish to call this mechanism an intent is up to you, but in the context of our attention economy, we believe “intents” sell. \n\nA key feature of intent-based trading protocols is outsourcing trade execution to a subset of competing searchers (these vary by name, eg. ‘solvers’, ‘fillers’ etc) which compete in an auction to find the optimal price route for users’ trades. In addition to a variety of onchain liquidity sources (liquidity pools on DEXs), these searchers are often able to tap into offchain inventory like CEX liquidity to front capital for the user’s trade. The benefits of using off-chain liquidity includes cost savings on gas fees, and deeper liquidity. That said, a shift towards becoming increasingly dependent on off-chain components has alarming implications on a greater scale. \n\nPrivate mempools, which offer users a “fast-pass” connection directly to the block builder, are becoming more widely adopted by both users and applications integrating various MEV-protection services such as MEV-Blocker, which now has over 600K unique users.\n\nInfrastructure -  A number of teams are working on core infrastructure for building intents-based applications. The most important developments we believe to be: \n\nSUAVE - Flashbots building a side chain which will serve as a developer toolbox for building auction-based models with intents.\n\nAnoma - The Anoma team is building out an entire network for enabling intent-based applications with privacy and security in mind. \n\nEssential - Building various models and standards for intents applications, including a DSL for intents, intent-centric account abstraction, and a modular intent layer. \n\nApplications \n\nCoWSwap ($COW): Not all intents-based protocols are equal: Flashbots research on Ethereum’s order flow markets revealed that CoWSwap solvers were the only competitive model in practice. Comparatively, 1inch Fusion’s resolver market and UniswapX’s filler market is significantly centralized. The Cow DAO recently voted to turn on the fee switch for CoWSwap creating an organic revenue stream for the protocol moving forward. There are plenty of other innovative features  -  TWAP orders, programmable orders - which can be used to help prevent people from getting liquidated on loans , “CoW Hook” transactions -  which allow users to combine multiple transactions into a single one , and most recently, the CoW AMM - an LVR-capturing AMM built with LPs in mind. \n\nAcross ($ACX): Across implements an intent-based execution model for Eth L1 <> L2 , L2 <> Eth L1, L2 <> bridging, in which solvers front liquidity to fulfill user trades and are reimbursed afterwards. With over $5B in total volume, 357k users, and $101m in TVL , Across is one of the most successful organic 3rd party bridges in DeFi today. It inherits the security properties of the UMA optimistic oracle, which enables solvers to take on the inherent risk when fronting capital to users knowing they will be reimbursed, and in turn provide faster bridging execution for users. \n\nIntentX: Unlike most other intent-based protocols which are swap aggregators, IntentX introduces perpetuals trading to the intents landscape. Having just launched in Q4 ‘23 , IntentX has already received $2.5M in deposits, facilitated $707m in volume, and generated $630k in revenue(!) on Base. As the intent-centric landscape continues to evolve, we’re keeping an eye on IntentX and its novel intent mechanism for perps trading. \n\nDeSoc \n\nAs Chris Dixon highlights in his new book “Read,Write,Own” : \n\n“Search and social ranking algorithms can change lives, make or break businesses, and even influence elections, yet the code that powers them is controlled by unaccountable corporate management teams largely hidden from public scrutiny” \n\nSocial networks are the essence of human connection and coordination, yet the overwhelming majority of revenue generated from content created on these networks funnels back to the platforms and not the users, entrepreneurs, and content creators themselves. The creator economy is in need of an overhaul, and decentralized social media (DeSoc) can help. \n\nDeSoc and crypto-native social networks offers new opportunities for monetizing creator <> fan relationships - once again a new unlock arises from disintermediation of rent-seeking middlemen. The idea is a good one - but the execution has not been there yet. Lens has continued to show some promise but hasn’t quite had a breakthrough moment yet. Friendtech died as quickly as it rose to fame. And, well, R.I.P. Stars Arena. \n\nFriendtech demonstrated that a PVP-style social application with financial incentives is not a sustainable growth model, nor will it capture a significant audience outside of crypto natives. \n\nOnboarding remains a critical hurdle - not only is it challenging/near impossible to switch to a new social network due to moving your followers/audience, imagine having to set up a self-custody wallet for the first time in your life as well. \n\nTo quote Antonio Garcia Martinez, a former Facebook PM: \n\n“Web3 needs to enable cool functionality not previously possible in Web2, and make the user largely unaware they are on the blockchain.” \n\nThis is why Farcaster is exciting. Although it broke new ATHs in users and activity recently, Farcaster is not just the latest hype train. Led by Dan Romero and Varun Srinivasan, the ex-Coinbase team has been working on their craft for some time now. Farcaster is not one particular app - rather it is the platform, the decentralized architecture which enables new applications to be built on top of it. Farcaster uses a hybrid back-end architecture, in which everything crypto/blockchain is abstracted away off-chain, while identity management is stored in smart contracts onchain.\n\nWarpcast, a client built by the core Farcaster team, offers a slick web2 social experience. Warpcast has a feed similar to that of Twitter’s, as well as specific channels which are similar to subreddits, allowing users to join communities and curate the content they wish to see. Sign up and follow Shoal on Warpcast today - tag us and we’ll follow back! \n\nFrames, which warrant an entire article of its own, offers new opportunities for developers to build embedded experiences directly into one shared interface. In other words, do more cool things without leaving the application you’re using. To honor internet culture, one of the core engineers put Doom in a frame. That said, there are many other exciting possibilities - imagine reading an article about the newest AI token, and being able to purchase the token without leaving the article (folks, a reminder to always do your due diligence).  Or getting all the latest news and updates from your favorite research telegram in one interface. Betting on a sports game directly from a live stream in your feed. \n\nThe connectivity of experiences will in turn grow the quality of the experiences and consequently their value. This is what Facebook tried to do but ultimately failed with the Open Graph protocol, largely due to technical and multi-party coordination problems that blockchains stand to solve. \n\nThe coolest thing about Farcaster is that these are only two clients - anyone can spin up clients custom-built for a user or enterprise’s needs. A16z has a repo with a bunch of clients available for anyone to get started building on today. We look forward to more innovation in this sector and are eager to work with teams building in the DeSOC space - reach out to Shoal! \n\nTelegram Bots \n\nTelegram bots are another exciting and unique way to interact with crypto. They are a premier example of a headless marketplace - where global demand and users meet local distribution venues (i.e. wherever a user’s wallet already is). \n\nTelegram bots abstract away many of the onboarding hurdles with crypto today - wallets are created on users’ behalf, and funds can can deposited to/withdrawn from an associated CEX address (i.e. Coinbase). Considering Telegram has 800M monthly active users today, this seems like a lucrative user base to tap into. \n\nThe rapid growth and adoption of telegram bots supports this notion - though it is important to pick out a select few quality picks among the 100s of bots launching nowadays. \n\nBanana Gun bot ($BANANA) - Supports Ethereum and Solana. In its lifetime, Banana Gun has done $1.4B in total volume and facilitated over 3B trades across 87K traders. Get up to speed with Shoal’s report on Banana Gun. \n\nBonkBot (TBD): Bonkbot was launched by a separate team from the BONK token. It the most performant TG bot on Solana, and has facilitated more trading volume than any other bot with $1.8B in trading volume across 24M trades and 158K traders. Bonkbot’s trades are automatically routed through Jupiter, creating a synergistic relationship with one of the top projects on Solana. \n\nUnibot ($UNIBOT) - Supports trading on Ethereum and Solana. Kicked off the TG bot mania in 2023. In its lifetime, Unibot has facilitated 731K trades with $479M in total volume and $4.7M in total fees. Get up to speed with Shoal’s Unibot report. \n\nFor someone who wants to get exposure to trading assets only available onchain but doesn’t want to deal with the hassle of creating a new wallet and navigating across 100s of trading venues (with the implied smart contract risk), telegram bots make perfect sense. After all, If you only want to trade memecoins, why would you care much for the intricacies of self custody? This can likely be applied to various other use cases beyond trading, i.e. borrow/lend on Aave through a telegram bot, mint NFTs, make payments, etc. \n\nParallel-Execution L1s\n\nThe rapid growth of the Solana ecosystem in H2 2023, continuing upwards in Q1 2024, has brought more recognition to the benefits of parallel-execution in transaction processing on blockchains. Though there will always be inherent value in the security of Ethereum, which processes transactions sequentially, the fact is that demand for low-latency and high throughput infrastructure will naturally outpace it as more users come to crypto and/or more enterprises seek to implement blockchain technology to solve real-world business tasks. \n\nThe key idea behind parallel execution is to allow non-conflicting transactions simultaneously, unlocking faster execution speeds and higher overall throughput. On Solana, accounts are required to declare which particular network state they need to access in each transaction, which is what allows for concurrent execution. Bob swapping 100 USDC > SOL on Jupiter does not conflict with Alice borrowing 1000 JUP on Kamino. \n\nThere is an emerging trend of “Alt-Parallel L1s” , which are relatively young networks (<= 1year) that process transactions in parallel, similar to Solana. \n\nA key distinction to make in parallel processing is deterministic vs optimistic processing. Deterministic processing, as seen on Solana, all nodes execute an agreed-upon set of transactions simultaneously in lock-step. Optimistic processing, for instance Sei’s design, processes transactions concurrently across multiple nodes, later verifying that the submitted transactions are valid. Therefore, it is possible for optimistic parallel-processing chains like Sei to have faster execution speeds than Solana, but this comes at the cost of potential rollbacks later on in the case of fraudulent activity. \n\nSei ($Sei) - Sei is an L1 built on the Cosmos SDK specialized for trading and financial services. V2, which is set to launch in H1 2024, introduces upgrades to several key features including smart contracts, parallel processing, and state storage. Sei currently has $23M in TVL, and $Sei is trading near a $2B market cap. \n\nSui ($Sui) - Sui is an L1 from Mysten Labs built on the MoveVM, which uses a parallel processing model for transactions to offer, you guessed it, high TPS and low fees. Sui currently has $649M in TVL, 10th most among all chains. Interestingly, $Sui is trading near a $2B market cap similar to Sei, despite having over 20x the TVL.\n\nMonad (TBD) - Monad is an EVM L1 which aims to deliver 10K+ TPS through optimistic parallel execution and “superscalar pipelining”. Monad is built by former Jump Trading employees with lots of experience in HFT, and has a very strong community (Gmonad). Monad is also going to use its own database MonadDB for data storage, eliminating a scaling constraint for previous EVM blockchains. \n\nData sourced from DeFi Llama \n\nModular Money\n\nModular blockchains are specialized chains built to serve a particular purpose while seamlessly connecting with other specialized chains. Blockchains perform 4 critical functions - Consensus, Execution, Settlement, and Data Availability.  While monolithic, or “integrated”, blockchains run all 4 functions on the base layer, modular blockchains adopt a “plug and play” approach where networks can opt to use specialized infrastructure to perform their critical functions. \n\nFor a simple analogy, consider putting together an outfit - you can get dressed head-to-toe in clothes all from one brand (monolithic), or you can wear a shirt from Hanes, jeans from Levi’s, and a jacket from Carharrt (modular). \n\nCelestia ($TIA) - Celestia co-founder Mustafa Al-Bassam wrote the Lazy Ledger research paper back in 2019 , which laid out the fundamental concept of a specialized system that helps other networks scale - what we call a modular blockchain today. Celestia functions as a specialized DA layer, offering a low-cost alternative for L2s to post their data.\n\nEclipse: New L2 which uses SVM for execution, Celestia for DA, Ethereum for settlement, and RISC ZERO for zk fraud proofs - doesn’t get more modular than that! We are excited to see new use-cases for the SVM especially with the rise of modular blockchains. There is some uncertainty around how Eclipse will actually perform given it resembles a bit of a Frankenstein-like experiment, but the team is strong and expectations are high for the novel L2. \n\nRollups-as-a-Service \n\nDevelopers building dApps have several options for deployment, including existing blockchains, Layer 2 solutions (L2), custom appchains, and rollups. Rollups can offer a sweet spot between customization, performance, and development effort, particularly with the simplified setup offered by Rollups-as-a-Service (RaaS) providers. These providers offer tools and services, ranging from rollup management to no-code deployment, enabling easy creation and maintenance of custom rollups.\n\nImagine running a busy restaurant (traditional blockchain): you handle everything from cooking to deliveries. RaaS is like hiring a delivery service (RaaS provider): they manage deliveries, freeing you to focus on cooking (development) and providing a smooth experience for customers (users).\n\nConduit: This platform empowers anyone to launch their own rollup quickly and easily, without needing to write any code. The self-serve platform takes care of everything, from infrastructure to security, so you can focus on what matters - building the product. Leading companies like Zora and Gitcoin trust Conduit to handle the technical complexities\n\nDymension ($DYM): Dymension leverages a modular blockchain architecture. Users interact with RollApps (front-end), while Dymension (back-end) coordinates the ecosystem and facilitates communication. Data Availability Networks (decentralized databases) provide temporary data storage.\n\nCartesi: Cartesi provides a dedicated CPU and rollup for your dApp, preserving decentralization, security, and censorship resistance while enhancing computational scalability. It utilizes the Cartesi Virtual Machine, allowing you to use familiar libraries, languages, and tooling, moving beyond the EVM.  \n\nGaming \n\nCrypto participants have long awaited \"the\" AAA Web3 game. In the last crypto cycle, Axie Infinity, Sandbox, Decentraland, and Enjin were among the core talking points as new gaming companies realized Web3 could be a new place to test out concepts. In the last cycle, we found many games that resembled \"DeFi with lore,\" which were focused more on interactions of farming/yield generation strategies instead of the actual games.\n\nFor many of these games, much of the feedback revolved around the actual fun of the games being the core gaming applications. Although these games performed well in the bull market, the sentiment wore off due to unstable tokenomics or their incentive mechanisms breaking despite substantial price increases.  \n\nRonin ($RON) - Ronin, developed by Sky Mavis, is an EVM-compatible blockchain tailored for gaming, most notably hosting the successful Web3 game Axie Infinity. Ronin focuses on near-instant transactions and minimal fees, while also enabling stands out for enabling vast numbers of in-game transactions.\n\nBeam ($BEAM) - Beam network is a gaming-centric ecosystem incubated by the Merit Circle DAO. It offers the Beam SDK to developers, allowing for the integration of blockchain elements into games. As the network's gas token, $BEAM is essential for transaction payments and smart contract interactions within the Beam ecosystem. \n\nEchelon Prime ($PRIME) - Echelon Prime is a gaming platform, focusing on development and distribution of tools designed to foster new gaming models and economic systems. Its token, $PRIME, has been notably integrated into Parallel, a sci-fi trading card game, marking its first application. Through $PRIME, Echelon Prime aims to facilitate and promote the expansion of cutting-edge gaming experiences and economies including AI and AR gaming.\n\nClosing Note\n\nWe are eager to engage with teams and founders pushing the boundaries of innovation in blockchain infrastructure and the on-chain economy. The digital asset landscape is filled with opportunities, as well as noise, and sifting through the haystack to find gem-like needles requires continuous research and refinement of our thesis. Shoal Research is dedicated to uncovering value within the DeFi and infrastructure ecosystem, as well as tracking trending narratives that intersect with our interests.\n\nSources \n\nData used in this report was mostly taken from DeFi Llama, Dune Analytics, and mentioned protocol docs.  \n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

The rapid growth in volume data has led developers to view CEXs as a profitable and sustainable business. Many protocols are forks of first mover exchanges, GMX and DYDX, with ongoing innovation in minor areas such as the choice of price feeds, the structure of trading fees, and methods of incentivizing user onboarding.\n\nJust like with DEXs, each DeFi sector features a multitude of forks. The reason the surplus of forks in the perpetual protocol arena intensifies competition is due to a simplistic business structure. Currently, there's a missed opportunity in not utilizing liquidity from perpetual protocols for creating DeFi Legos.\n\nIntroduction to Drift Protocol\n\nDrift is building a decentralized perpetual protocol using the dynamic vAMM (DAMM) mechanism on Solana. Drift V2 was launched mid 2022 and, due to its new hybrid liquidity solution, has grown as the top 5 perp in terms of TVL. Drift stands out as it successfully operated as a protocol for 2 years without a native token. Drift protocol offers many types of derivative market including perps, spot, lending, etc.\n\nDrift v1 and Problems\nvAMM\n\nIn most cases, automated market makers (AMMs) are used for swaps, known as spot trading. Traditionally, AMMs price assets using a Constant Product x * y=k  formula, in which x and y represent the reserve balances of two assets in a liquidity pool, and k represents the total liquidity available. The key concept here is that k remains constant throughout the course of trade, due to automatic rebalancing.  \n\nPerpetual Protocol, another perp exchange, building upon the foundation of AMMs, initially proposed the virtual automated market maker, or vAMM solution. Unlike traditional AMMs, transactions with vAMMs do not rely on underlying assets. Though the same x * y=k  formula is used, it is important to note that k is pre-determined and fixed in a vAMM model, as all trades occur within this virtual pool. \n\nFor example, if users want to leverage 5x on SOL using 1000 USDC, they need to send 1000 USDT to a vault. In return, the protocol credits 5000 vUSDC into the vAMM for purchasing SOL and then they have corresponding SOL exposure.\n\nDrift V1 was built on top of this concept, with two innovations: re-pegging and adjusting liquidity. Re-pegging means effectively updating the quoted assets price in accordance with the oracle price (asset price), making trades happen in the deeper liquidity region. By being in the deeper liquidity region, trades are executed better. The oracle feeds price data to the vAMM and sets it as the latest 'terminal (start) price', then the collected fees are added to the pool to meet the price adjustment, ensuring sufficient liquidity within the active price range after adjustment . In the initial vAMM model, parameter ‘k’ is set when a pool is created. However, in Drift V1, ‘k’ can be adjusted many times. Put simply, to further deepen liquidity, the accrued trading fees are injected into the vAMM pool similarly to adding liquidity to Uniswap V2, then resulting in an increase on ’k’. \n\nThe Problem\n\nIn traditional spot-AMM or Peer-to-Pool models, there is always one party acting as the passive liquidity provider (LP), with traders' profits coming from these passive LPs. However, in the case of a vAMM without passive LPs, traders act as ‘LP’ for each other, meaning that for one trader to profit, there must be another trader as the counterparty. Therefore, no one wants to be the last trader left. As a result, most people prefer to strategically open and close positions to execute arbitrage strategies, ultimately creating a player versus player (PVP) market.\n\nIf there are always a large number of traders, such a PVP market can continue to operate normally. However, the problem arises that the market may collapse when arbitrageurs are unable to obtain sufficient profits. The pre-set 'k' sets the start price. When the current price is higher than the start price, positions are net long and vice versa. In most cases, the fair price is driven by CEXs, so the vAMM pool needs to repeg using collected trading fees as the fair price deviates from the start price. But at the same time, funding fees are paid by collected trading fees. When deviation gets larger, the cost for repegging and k-adjustment will increase as well. Although the funding fee is capped, the cost of repegging & k-adjustment could drain the Insurance Fund, then arbitrageurs gain less. \n\nArbitrageurs are going to leave if the yield is not attractive anymore for them, most of the collected fees are used to provide a ‘better’ price for retailers. The problem is: no arbitrageurs, no volume, no fees.\n\nDue to vAMM's asymmetric trading model, funds could be drained by price manipulation if there is poor leverage management. A manipulator can be allowed to open two high-leverage positions one after the other, pushing the price to a point where the profit from one position could cover the loss from the other; this profit is derived from the funds of other users. Furthermore, the disparity between positive and negative PnL could potentially result in insolvency.\n\nDrift v2 Core Design\n\nDrift V2 introduces a hybrid liquidity solution, aiming to provide more collateral and lower the risk of vAMM itself. For Drift V2, there are 3 types liquidity guarantee the best price for traders when an order is executed:\n\nJust-in-Time (JIT) Liquidity\n\nvAMM Liquidity\n\nDecentralized Orderbook (DLOB) Liquidity\n\nJIT Liquidity\n\nWhen a market order is submitted by a trader, it is broadcasted to a network of market makers composed of Keepers and initiates a Dutch auction. By default, the Dutch auction lasts for 5 seconds (20 slots), and the starting price is determined by the oracle price and the inventory status of the vAMM. During this process, market makers continuously front-run in a race, with the price changing from best to worst for the taker. JIT auction gives traders the opportunity to experience zero slippage in their trading activities.\n\nvAMM Liquidity\n\nIn Drift V2, vAMM will act as the backstop liquidity if no MMs execute market orders. Drift v2 AMM features in-built bid/ask spread and Drift Liquidity Provider (DLP). DLP is a passive liquidity provider with active functions, opening opposing positions against vAMM. Users could add liquidity to the specific pool and acquire a share of its taker fees. In-built bid/ask spread makes the Drift vAMM wider liquidity rather than just fills at current oracle price in the auction process. Through this process, the long/short imbalance with a higher cost is eased. \n\nRegardless of if it is vAMM or oracle-based, perpetual markets are always zero-sum traders that make profit from others’ loss. This contrasts V1s, where traders have ‘real’ liquidity as their PnL, which is significant as more collateral is provided. After integrating DLP into DAMM, liquidity depth will be improved by increasing ‘k’, and the 80% trading fee will be distributed to DLP as a reward.\n\nDrift V2 also introduces a new oracle-based pricing mechanism, which optimizes the process of repegging and the setting of spreads by considering factors such as the volatility and inventory. This ensures that arbitrageurs engage in activities to balance long and short positions efficiently. The price movement in V2 relies on oracle feeds instead of the long/short imbalance. The chart below shows that net open interest (OI) could strike a balance at some times.\n\nDecentralized Orderbook (DLOB) Liquidity\n\nDrift V2 provides a decentralized orderbook network. The mechanism behind it is very simple - a network of bots called Keepers are responsible for recording, storing, and matching and filling submitted  limit orders. Every Keeper bot has its own off-chain orderbook. Orders are sorted by price, age, and position size. When one order meets the trigger price, the keepers will submit to trade against DAMM. In return, keepers  receive a proportion of the trading fee determined by a mathematical formula, which is further explained here . It's worth noting that if there are buy and sell orders with exactly the same parameters (i.e. buy 1 SOL for 110 USDC <> sell 1 SOL for 110 USDC), Keepers can directly match them without going through vAMM, which can improve efficiency.\n\nOverall, to address the solvency, Drift V2 decentralizes order execution to real liquidity sources such as JIT, DLP, and direct order-matching in DLOB (which also means more collateral). \n\nOther features\nSpot\n\nDrift V2 provides spot trading and spot margin trading. In contrast to perpetual trading, all types of spot trading are based on real underlying assets. For example, the liquidity of spot trading comes from OpenBook DEX. Additionally, spot and margin trading allows users to leverage their spot by borrowing assets on Drift V2. The aim of two methods are primarily to hedge perpetual position.\n\nSwap\n\nSwap on Drift relies on Jupiter routing to provide the best price for users. However, the liquidity source comes from Drift V2 itself. Users are also able to leverage swap using flash loan.\n\nLend/Borrow\n\nDrift lending module is similar to Aave in that it uses an overcollateral mechanism. When you deposit your assets to Drift, the assets will generate yield automatically.\n\nGrowth Catalyst\nIncentive expection\n\nDrift launched its V1 in 2021. Until now, Drift hasn't had its own native token, missing an opportunity to incentivize user onboarding for the protocol. Despite this, Drift V2 has already achieved over 5 billion in total trading volume and nearly 100,000 users. \n\nOn January 24, 2024, Drift announced that it would also become a member of the points-meta, launching its own points system for a duration of three months. Drift has a strong team and a history of rapidly iterating products. We believe that after the launch of the points system, the Drift protocol will gain a larger market share and trading volume.\n\nSolana fundamental thesis\n\nThe resurgence of Solana in 2023 was exciting, particularly towards the end of the year.\n\nHigh-quality projects such as Jito brought more liquidity to Solana. \n\nThe meme trend also saw a boom due to Solana's technical advantages, with Bonkbot earning $10M fees in December and BananaGun launching its own Solana version. \n\nDepin and RWA narrative brought more exposure to Solana.\n\nThe increase in TVL, users, and on-chain activities brought about by the thriving Solana ecosystem will be the fundamental driving force behind the growth of the Drift protocol. Drift will have more opportunities to capture the yields generated by DeFi protocols and the launch of active assets will bring about demand for leveraged trading.\n\nPotential opportunity\n\nWe’ve observed many perpetual DEX’s growing with different stategies. One of Drift’s biggest advantages is its leader position in Solana ecosystem. Since the meme season began, more and more long-tail assets emerged with large volume and good liquidity. If Drift could work like HyperLiquid and list more popular tokens, Drift could become a main degen hub on Solana. \n\nThe TVL of Drift V2 currently sits at $171 million, ranking 5th in the derivatives category on DeFiLlama. Out of Drift V2's TVL, DLP accounts for approximately $16 million. Market Maker Vault represents $16 million and Insurance Fund Vault $10 million. The remaining TVL is composed of depositors' assets. Drift currently serves 133k users and has facilitated over 9.4M trades, indicatig t Drift V2 has a sufficient asset and user base. \n\nAlthough the daily trading volume is between $50 million to $100 million which is , it lags significantly behind competitors in other ecosystems. At the same time, there is a lack of trading intent and the yields generated by sub-products are not very attractive to users. We believe that trading will improve with the launch of Drift's incentive plan. As a series A product, it is worth noting that a higher profit growth brought by token incentives could enhance the underlying yield for depositors, thereby creating a flywheel effect.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom V1 to V2, we can see a very clear trend of improvement in Drift's vAMM solution, which is the continuous addition of real liquidity and the strengthening of the oracle's intervention in pricing. Although it seems to negate the original design concept of vAMM, in reality, the combination of real liquidity and vAMM can provide users with a better experience when trading long-tail assets. With its token and points system, Drift will become increasingly profitable.\n\nHowever, Drift also has apparent shortcomings. Thanks to the high performance of Solana, the hybrid liquidity solution also turns the transactions on Drift into a sort of order flow mode. So Keepers and DLP, serving as liquidity providers, cannot achieve equal status in executing transactions so that the attraction of DLP is not strong enough. We believe that the upcoming token may bring more possibilities for improvements to Drift.\n\nReference\n\nhttps://docs.drift.trade\n\nhttps://blog.perp.fi/a-deep-dive-into-our-virtual-amm-vamm-40345c522eeb\n\nhttps://driftprotocol.medium.com/deep-dive-into-drifts-dynamic-vamm-part-1-3-c2121fbce3c4\n\nhttps://medium.com/@ragetrade/the-perpetual-pvp-ponzi-beaff4a0c662\n\nNot financial or tax advice. The purpose of this newsletter is purely educational and should not be considered as investment advice, legal advice, a request to buy or sell any assets, or a suggestion to make any financial decisions.

    "publication_date": "2023-11-20T14:10:24.716Z",
    "content": "Discover more from Shoal Research\nCrypto Research and Insights\nOver 1,000 subscribers\nBy subscribing, I agree to Substack's Terms of Use, and acknowledge its Information Collection Notice and Privacy Policy.\nSubscribe\nContinue reading\nSign in\nUnderwriting LRTs: Balancing High Yield with Novel Risks\nUnderwriting the risk of Eigenlayer liquid restaking tokens within the DeFi ecosystem\nDUCK, ETHAN LIPPMAN, AND GABE TRAMBLE\nFEB 14, 2024\n8\n2\nShare\n\nIntroducing Liquid Restaking Tokens\n\nThe advent of Eigenlayer gives rise to a novel exotic collateral type: liquid restaking tokens (LRTs). LRTs are to restaking what liquid staking tokens (LSTs) are to staking—tokenized representations of Eigenlayer restaking positions. LRTs bear novel risks at the promise of higher yields paid for by the protocol-level applications (actively validated services or AVSs) that use EigenLayer to rent Ethereum's crypto-economic security. \n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nSubscribe\n\nLRTs lean into the composability of public blockchains, fostering the financialization of EigenLayer’s pooled security —allowing users to not have to choose between liquidity and yield. Put simply, why would a user forfeit DeFi yield opportunities to lose liquidity and restake their ETH or vice versa, when instead they could forgo opportunity cost and chase yield through both. \n\nMuch like LSTs, LRTs will be the collateral of choice for many crypto users across lending protocols, CDP stablecoins, DEXs, perpetual futures applications and more. EigenLayer views LRTs as a financial buffer that safeguards EigenLayer and AVSs from external financial risks associated with LRTFi.\n\nAs with any novel collateral, the question arises: \"How can DeFi protocols underwrite LRT risk profiles to adopt them properly?\". This understanding is essential for building sustainable and capital-efficient protocols.\n\nMore Risk, More Reward\n\nAn LRT’s risk profile is composed of the incremental risk from restaking ETH into EigenLayer, and the risks associated with the implementation of the LRTs. \n\nETH restaked into EigenLayer is delegated to an operator. An operator performs validation services for Ethereum and for the AVSs they choose to secure. By opting to restake with a particular AVS, stakers and operators receive rewards from AVSs paying for EigenLayer security, and also accept the risk that their deposited assets may be slashed (taken away as a penalty) according to the rules in the AVSs slashing contract.\n\nLRT providers deploy a set of smart-contracts on Ethereum that enables users to deposit/withdraw ETH/LSTs, and mint/burn LRTs. The risk profile between LRTs will vary depending on the LRT's operator set and which AVSs are being secured. \n\nTo start, the incremental slashing risk from restaking will be low given EigenLayer's slashing veto committee and screening of AVSs. But, in a future world with infinite AVSs, there are 2n-1 permutations of AVSs that can be secured by an operator, n AVSs secured. So, there can be lower-yielding, conservative LRTs and higher-yielding, risky ones —analogous to why there are bond credit ratings.\n\nOverview of LRT Risk Profile\n\nThis section will introduce the risks inherent in LRTs, given their architecture, and the risks created by introducing LRTs into the broader crypto-economic landscape. \n\nAVS Slashing\n\nAn AVS is any system that requires its own distributed validation semantics for verification. The design space for what protocols can create outsized value as AVSs is infinite (overview of first 12 major AVS). So, in the long run, the biggest risk that LRTs will bear will come from novel AVS slashing conditions. \n\nOne major value proposition of LRTs is enabling users to outsource risk management to the LRT provider i.e. the LRT provider chooses an operator set and underwrites which AVSs to secure. When choosing an LRT provider, users should consider:\n\nDoes the LRT provider have a comprehensive understanding of the protocol risks associated with each validated AVS?\n\nWhat is the LRT provider’s delegation strategy? Is it open source or proprietary? Does the LRT provider’s community have input in delegation?\n\nOperator Malpractice \n\nOperators are tasked with managing validators that run the Ethereum client and software provided by the AVSs that are being secured. Operators register in EigenLayer and allow restakers to delegate ETH to them. On EigenLayer testnet we see institutional validators. Figment, Blockdeamon, Chorus One, P2P, Google Cloud, Kiln, etc, that will likely only secure the most robust AVSs, and smaller operators who will aim to differentiate by supporting more AVSs to improve potential restaking rewards to delegates.\n\nSlashing is fundamental to Ethereum and EigenLayer's crypto-economic security model; it deters malicious acts by levying economic penalties against validators who act against the interest of the network. This article sheds light on the real vs perceived risks of slashing in the context of Ethereum and EigenLayer.\n\n\nWhen evaluating EigenLayer operator slashing risk, the following considerations should be made:\n\nWho is the operator(s) for the underlying EigenPods?\n\nDoes the operator have a proper risk mitigation strategy in place to avoid slashing and downtime?\n\nDoes the operator’s dev-ops team have enough bandwidth to combat unforeseen circumstances relative to the number and complexity of AVS being secured?\n\nDoes the operator have off-chain insurance to compensate for potential slashing events?\n\nWhat is the commission structure of the operator?\n\nSupported Deposit Assets\n\nAs of time of publishing, LRT providers can choose to accept ETH (to natively restake) and the following LSTs (to liquid restake) as depositable assets: ankrETH, OETH, LSETH, rETH, stETH, cbETH, osETH, swETH, mETH, ETHx, wBETH, sfrxETH.\n\nLSTs create value by enabling users to earn ETH staking yields and maintain liquidity without having to run a validator node, which requires 32 ETH. LSTs bear risk from Ethereum slashing, exploits, and secondary market volatility. If the LSTs node operators act maliciously or unreliably, users can have their funds slashed. Security risk arises from relying on the node operators to secure their private keys and trusting the robustness of the LST protocols smart contracts. Finally, LSTs, not pegged to their underlying assets, can face price fluctuations; market events and lower trading volumes can significantly affect their stability compared to the underlying assets.\n\nIf LST(s) are accepted by LRT providers, then the LRT will bear the risks of the underlying LST(s). \n\nIs the LRT composed of natively restaked ETH, or restaked LSTs\n\nIf restaked LSTs, who are the node operators for those LSTs?\n\nWhat percentage of the overall deposits does each type of accepted collateral make up?\n\nAccess to Liquidity\n\nAll funds unstaked from EigenLayer go through a 7-day escrow period before being able to be withdrawn, creating duration risk for LRTs. Furthermore, many LRT providers have not enabled withdrawal functionality.\n\nWhat is the TVL of the LRT?\n\nIs there a healthy amount of secondary market liquidity for the LRT?\n\nWhat is the redemption process for the LRT?\n\nWhat are the short-term liquidity incentives LRT providers are offering?\n\nSmart Contract \n\nWhat protocol architecture risks exist for the LRTs?\n\nHow are rewards being paid out? Rebasing or value accrual?\n\nWhat is the fee structure of the LRT provider?\n\nHow are admin multi-sig permissions structured? What permissions are involved in transferring assets and pausing withdrawals?\n\nThe following risks are not inherent to the LRT but arise due to the LRTs' adoption across the broader crypto-economic landscape.\n\nOracle\n\nAre there reliable and robust price oracles in place to ensure accurate pricing of the LRTs?\n\nGovernance\n\nWhat governance risks exist for the LRTs?\n\nHow are AVSs chosen to be secured?\n\nTo what extent can governance be used to ‘king make’ AVSs? What incentives does this dynamic create?\n\nCross-Chain\n\nIn the case of cross-chain LRTs, how is bridging implemented? Are canonical or non-canonical bridges being used? \n\nIn the case of non-canonical bridges, how is the LRT provider approaching issues with fungibility with the L2 enshrined bridge and the tradeoff of batch latency?  \n\nCentralization Concerns\n\nWhat is the market structure of LRTs? \n\nTo what extent do LRTs have a  centralizing effect on EigenLayer’s shared security offering?\n\nLooping Risk\n\nIn lending markets, looping LRTs can trigger widespread liquidations, a risk confined to specific lending markets without impacting EigenLayer's security. This mirrors the 2022 stETH depeg event, where stETH's price risk was contained within the lending market, leaving Ethereum consensus unaffected.\n\nAddressing The Risks of LRTs\n\nAddressing and managing the risks of LRTs is necessary for them to scale securely and be widely adopted. To do so, it’s required to understand the benchmarks that can be used to underwrite LRT risks and how to incorporate them into DeFi protocols for parameterizing markets since they are quantifiable and endogenous to LRTs.\n\nBenchmarks For Underwriting LRT Risks\n\nLRTs have the work cut out for them when mitigating risks for their users. They must properly underwrite and select a portfolio of AVSs to secure while performing in line with the expectations of their ideal user.\n\nSelecting the right AVSs to opt into requires LRTs to understand the slashing conditions of each AVS as well as the infrastructural design decisions that the AVSs include, one example being the underlying consensus mechanism of an AVS. With each AVS a liquid restaking provider opts into, they add to the set of slashing conditions that the node operators are committed to not violate.\n\nViolating slashing conditions causes LRT holders to incur a direct economic loss to their position. Under traditional Ethereum slashing conditions, slashed validators incur an initial deduction of ETH, followed by a potential correlated slashing penalty after 16 days, and ending with their removal from the beacon-chain after a 38-day period. Typically the ETH lost to a slashing is marginal compared to the total ETH staked with the liquid restaking provider, however if a large sum of validators are slashed within a close period of time they can become subject to a correlated slashing penalty which contributes to a significantly greater loss than in typical scenarios. Under the traditional Ethereum slashing conditions, slashings are not prevalent, and in the context of this paper it should be noted that they are not tied to AVSs in any way. However, AVSs will have their own set of complex slashing conditions, and it’s certainly beneficial to understand the propensity for validators to be slashed under the scope of an AVS’s design as well as the impact each slashing actually has on the slashed validator.\n\nThis implies that it’s also important for LRTs to properly configure their validator set profile to minimize the risk of slashing if they are natively restaking. The majority of LRTs will most likely begin by implementing permissioned node operator sets to ensure the quality of validators operating on their behalf. Client and geographic diversity can play a big role here by limiting the centralization risks of a validator set. Distributed validator technology (DVT) and trusted execution environments (TEEs) can be used to improve the reliability and security of a validator set further. DVT further increases the diversity of the validator set while TEEs essentially act as anti-slashing software by protecting the validators using them from violating slashing conditions (for example only allowing the validator to sign off on a block once, avoiding potential double signs). Hopefully in the future we’ll see modular anti-slashers that can be extended to a variety of AVSs that share similar functionalities and slashing conditions making the application of TEEs more extendable to different AVS designs. If LRTs are not natively restaking they can expand the variety of liquid staking tokens that they accept to deposit – selecting those LSTs who’s own validator set meet the aforementioned security recommendations that match the LRTs desired risk profile.\n\nThe potential permutations of AVS strategies scales rapidly the more there are: 2n- 1 for n AVSs. This requires them to pick an optimal portfolio of AVSs to fit their desired risk profile and strategy. Some have even called for a standard to be created for a \"vanilla\" portfolio of AVSs that fits a widely accepted risk profile. In both scenarios, AVSs must identify methods of characterizing the aforementioned risks and quantifying their real impact to the LRT to justify the yield returned to restakers for securing the portfolio of AVSs.\n\nKey Benchmarks\n\nAVS slashing conditions\n\nPropensity of slashing under AVS slashing conditions\n\nAVS consensus mechanism\n\nValidator client diversity\n\nValidator geographic diversity\n\nValidator DVT integration\n\nValidator TEE integration\n\nPermissioned vs Permissionless node operator sets\n\nHow DeFi Protocols Can Incorporate Underwriting Methods\n\nIncumbent DeFi protocols are not readily designed to incorporate these infrastructural security benchmarks. They rely more on liquidity, which is another bottleneck for these assets. So, if most of the benchmarks for underwriting LRTs is infrastructural, and if it's not yet been proven that there will be deep liquidity for LRTs then we find ourselves quite limited in the current landscape to facilitate DeFi products for LRTs. That is, if most of our benchmarks are infrastructural, it doesn't make sense to price the risk of these assets according to market price, which is heavily dependent on liquidity. Instead, we might be able to look toward pricing risk based on the soundness and solvency of the asset. After all, LRTs are really just a restaked representation of staked ETH, which is a staked representation of ETH. ETH itself is much less volatile than the rest of crypto. However, suppose LRTs have far less liquidity available. In that case, the market price of LRTs will be much more volatile than that of ETH, exposing restakers to a greater risk of liquidation. \n\nDeFi lending is the arena in which the underwriting of risk is most necessary as it's been seen to be the largest DeFi use case for liquid staking tokens and will most likely also be the largest DeFi use case for liquid restaking tokens. The current generation of DeFi lending protocols operate based on liquidity and governance. That is, service providers like Gauntlet parameterize markets by analyzing the liquidity available for an asset and running scenarios to identify conditions that could lead to large scale liquidations and insolvency. As we've already discussed, adopting this underwriting methodology for market parameterization does not account for the inherent infrastructural risks to LRTs. Rather, it exacerbates the liquidity risks associated with LRTs and puts lending protocols at greater risk of bad debt, especially since many of the incumbent protocols utilize pooled lending, sharing risk across the entire protocol/pool. Aave is the most relevant in this generation of lending protocols given their large exposure to LSTs and recent improvements aimed at supporting them in a more capital efficient and secure manner.\n\nAave\n\nAave, originally called ETHLend, was one of the first lending markets on-chain. As an open-source and non-custodial platform, Aave allows participants to engage directly with each other without the need for traditional financial intermediaries. Users who provide liquidity to the market by depositing into Aave's liquidity pools can earn interest, while borrowers can obtain loans by over-collateralizing, ensuring the security of the loans. Aave supports a wide range of assets, offering features like variable and stable interest rates, as well as innovative DeFi concepts such as flash loans, which allow for the borrowing of assets without collateral, provided that the loan is returned within the same transaction block. This flexibility and the protocol's emphasis on security and transparency have positioned Aave as a key player in the DeFi ecosystem. When it comes to supporting staked assets and potentially restaked assets in the future, the following factors bear the highest impact.\n\nGovernance-Based Market Parameterizations - Aave, advised by service providers like Gauntlet, votes through DAO governance to set market parameters by assessing asset liquidity and potential for large-scale liquidations. However, this approach overlooks the structural risks to LRTs, increasing liquidity risks and the potential for bad debt in pooled lending systems, where risks are shared across all participants.\n\nAave E-Mode - The High-Efficiency mode feature (or \"eMode\") is designed to maximize capital efficiency when collateral and borrowed assets, such as ETH, LSTs, and LRTs, are correlated in price. Other assets can be used as collateral, but only assets of the same category can be borrowed in E-mode; otherwise, the user would have to exit the E-mode configuration. Ultimately, it enables a greater LTV for borrowers. However, because it is a more specialized configuration, it takes additional oversight from service providers to properly parameterize the market, especially considering that recursive borrowing is a prominent strategy made more efficient with higher LTVs. This is notable because recursive borrowing is the act of levering up on the collateral asset to increase exposure to it (in this case, levering up on staked assets to increase exposure to the staking yield), which increases the risk of cascading liquidations from price volatility and decoupling of LSTs from the base ETH.\n\nAave Killswitch - The Killswitch is a framework for Aave to limit LST borrowing power when abnormal conditions arise (i.e. price decoupling of LRTs). It was recommended by Gauntlet that in the such an event killswitch be enabled to \n\nAutomate liquidation threshold reduction to liquidate the riskiest positions gradually.\n\nFreezing the LST deposits and making the LTV 0 so there could be no more borrows.\n\nDoubling the slope of the interest rate curve to reduce utilization.\n\nLower the LTV to non-E-mode LST parameters to further reduce the impact.\n\nHowever, through the governance process, an option was chosen to only freeze LST deposits and drive the LTV to 0. However, this is concerning because price decoupling occurs in a continuous fashion, so even if it prevents additional insolvencies in the market, it does not reduce the trouble with the existing risk. It kind of just leaves positions sitting to either get liquidated or recover from the decoupling.\n\nA new generation of DeFi protocols is evolving to increase modular and permissionless design, enabling their markets to be more composable to what the free market desires rather than being subject to traditional governance procedures. While many new lending protocols like Ajna and Euler are entering the space, the two we'll discuss here currently support LSTs and LRTs, whereas the others do not. These two protocols are Morpho Blue and Ion Protocol.\n\nMorpho\n\nMorpho Blue is a lending market that recently launched as a follow-up to Morpho's previous product, Morpho Optimizers. It utilizes isolated lending markets, enabling permissionless market creation. This is complemented by externalized risk management, oracle agnostic pricing, and permissionless interest rate modules. Each parameter is selected at market creation and persists in perpetuity (i.e., they are immutable). Like Aave, they must adhere to governance specifications when selecting the liquidation loan to value ratio and interest rate model. In its current form, Morpho Blue is a much more modular version of Aave, with markets siloed and tailored to an individual or entity's desired parameters, which is a difficult task in itself to design. It is hard to say whether users will take advantage of such freedom or whether the responsibilities of curating risk management strategies and designing oracles and interest models will flow to more established service providers. \n\nIon Protocol\n\nIon Protocol is a lending protocol specifically built for staked and restaked assets. It is currently live on testnet, in the final stages before launching on mainnet. Ion Protocol takes a different approach to market parameterization, by underwriting the endogenous infrastructure risks of LRTs to optimize capital efficiency and minimize the risks of liquidations and protocol insolvency. Ion utilizes isolated markets, solvency-based underwriting, yield reactive interest rates, and partial liquidations to give users direct access to sustainable and efficient ETH-denominated yield.\n\nSolvency-based underwriting - Ion Protocol was designed to be price agnostic. Price-agnostic markets utilize the reserve ratio of LSTs and LRTs rather than their market price. That is, LSTs and LRTs can be valued according to their circulating supply relative to how much ETH is staked or restaked within a token's provider's validator set. By valuing LSTs and LRTs, Ion Protocol creates a scenario where borrowers are only liquidated if a slashing event directly impacts the provider's validator set. This significantly reduces the chances of liquidations and enables greater capital efficiency – Ion can raise LTVs from the industry standards of about 0.8 to 0.9 and above. This is all powered by ZK proof of reserve in partnership with Succinct.\n\nmin(protocolexchangerate,proofofreserve)\n\nCollateral-specific interest rates - Ion's interest rate model is strictly defined per collateral. It requires that the borrowing rate be less than the staking yield to provide a profit margin to borrowers, enabling them to lever up and continue to earn efficiently. They provide a minimum borrow rate for instances where the staking yield drops too low to sustain the profit margin reasonably. However, if the staking yield increases, the earnings generated get directly passed to lenders and borrowers. Each collateral type's market is unique and parameterized to create an efficient borrowing experience while properly compensating lenders.\n\nZKML Slashing Prediction - Ion Protocol has partnered with Modulus labs to develop a ZKML model for predicting the propensity of slashing within a validator set. This will help inform the market parameterizations. It acts as a mechanism to unbiasedly quantify the probability that a validator will experience a slashing event and then aggregates that to the level of the validator set. \n\nIon Protocol is becoming the most efficient option for stakers and restakers to participate in DeFi lending. By taking an asset specific approach to their mechanism design, the team has designed the protocol to incentivize the things specifically pertinent to staked and restaked assets.\n\nConcurrently with the new generation of lending protocols, we have seen the rise of new and innovative CDP protocols.\n\nEbisu Finance\n\nEbisu Finance is a yield-bearing stablecoin backed by LRTs. Ebisu unlocks capital efficiency for restaked assets by enabling users to draw dollar-denominated credit (ebUSD) against natively restaked ETH and LRTs via a non-custodial, decentralized stablecoin. ebUSD gives users access to a stable store of value while enabling yield generation through AVS rewards and Ethereum staking rewards. By driving demand for LRTs, Ebisu also contributes to scaling the restaking ecosystem, bolstering Ethereum's shared security and economic alignment.  \n\nWith any lending protocol, it is imperative to ensure that bad debt does not accrue in the system. Ebisu lending implements isolated collateral positions so that the system can work smoothly to liquidate the riskiest debt positions. ebUSD can be redeemed against its underlying collateral at face value. eg. 1 ebUSD can be redeemed for $1 USD denominated in restaked collateral. Redeemed ebUSD is used to repay the riskiest debt position, and transfers the respective amount of restaked collateral from the liquidated position to the redeemer.\n\nAdditionally, Ebisu will have a stability pool, as is common amongst CDP stablecoins. The Stability Pool, funded by users, safeguards loans by providing ebUSD as liquidity to cover debts from liquidated debt positions. This ensures that the total supply of ebUSD is solvent and adequately backed. Upon the liquidation of any debt positions, an ebUSD amount equal to the debt position’s outstanding debt is eliminated from the Stability Pool to settle this debt. Concurrently, the remaining collateral of the liquidated debt position, net of liquidation fees, is transferred to the Stability Pool. Depositors in the Stability Pool are then eligible to withdraw a portion of this liquidated collateral, pro rata to their proportion of the Pool's total balance. This arrangement is designed to leave a net benefit for depositors, as the value of the collateral is generally higher than the amount of debt that was extinguished. The use of a stability pool enables Ebisu to process liquidations without having to price the LRT collateral.\n\nFuture Exploration\n\nSo far, we’ve discussed the benchmarks and primitives actively being explored and developed that can be used to underwrite the riskiness of an LRT for its use in DeFi. However, some questions remain. \n\nCan we reliably use these benchmarks and primitives to scale restaking, particularly liquid restaking tokens, to the same heights we’ve seen liquid staking tokens scale?\n\nWhere can we turn to formalize these concepts further and standardize the metrics so that we can onboard bigger players?\n\nAnswering these questions is a challenging feat. Regarding the first question, if LRTs and restaking can be sustainably supported in DeFi, then it’s possible for them to become as ubiquitous of a representation of ETH as LSTs if not more. Getting to this spot requires us to spend more time on the second question, and work on making standards and formalized concepts to help us on the way. At the beginning of this section, we discussed that the risks inherent to LRTs stem from their selection of AVSs, so it makes sense to formalize some kind of portfolio theory for AVS selection. Some have suggested that this could be a function that takes each potential strategy (2^n- 1 strategies for n AVS) and identifies a max loss by summing the max loss of each AVS included in a strategy, with the max loss being defined as the maximum percentage of stake that can be frozen/slashed by each AVS. This makes sense! Although, it may still be too simple to capture all of the benchmarks we mentioned earlier truly. One alternative could be to follow Ion Protocol's lead by utilizing machine learning to create a feature set and objective function similar to the MaxLoss objective function in order to identify the propensity of slashing for each AVS and an expectation of the loss.\n\nAfter quantifying risk, it also makes sense to create a library of different metrics that can be used to help explain the choices made for a portfolio as well as its performance. One such metric that has been suggested is one that is on par with the Sharpe Ratio, a measurement of risk-adjusted relative returns. For restaking, the risk-adjusted returns could look something like (staking rewards - infra cost) / MaxLoss. Others might include something like a yield beta, or how well the restaking yield tracks the underlying performance of the staking yield for a particular AVS as well as for a particular strategy or portfolio. \n\nAll in all, we are at the precipice of a boom of newly created products to help further expand the benefits of crypto-economic security and allow more participants to share in the rewards. It's important to understand, benchmark, test, and formalize the kinds of mechanisms and metrics that can help protect against and inform users of the risks associated with LRTs and the market's they are being used in.\n\nSource\n\nPreventing restaking centralization risks\n\nRestaking portfolios 101 — Renzo Protocol \n\n2.8.7 Slashing \n\nV3 Overview - Developers \n\nMorpho Overview \n\nIon Protocol \n\nRisk FAQ | EigenLayer\n\nTwelve Early Projects Building on EigenLayer\n\nEigenLayer Ecosystem Unraveled - by Ian Unsworth\n\nLiquity Docs\n\nMitigating Risks and Best Practices for Restaking in EigenLayer\n\nNot financial or tax advice. The purpose of this newsletter is purely educational and should not be considered as investment advice, legal advice, a request to buy or sell any assets, or a suggestion to make any financial decisions.

Perpetual decentralized exchanges (perp DEXs) stand out as pioneers in the derivatives market, empowering users to engage in on-chain trading of crypto derivatives directly from their wallets. Many offer leverage of up to 50x—a capability akin to centralized exchanges. \n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nSubscribe\n\nIn the rapidly evolving digital asset trading ecosystem, perp DEXs seek innovative ways to distinguish themselves beyond only offering higher leverage options. One emerging concept is perpetual pre-launch futures, a novel financial instrument that enables the trading of tokens before they are officially launched. This article delves into the mechanics and implications of perpetual pre-launch futures, highlighting their potential in a market where differentiation and early adoption are key.\n\nThe Business of Attention and Speculation in Crypto Markets\n\nThe decentralized and open-source nature of digital assets inherently fuels speculation, especially due to the instant tokenization of value. To gain early exposure to projects, savvy crypto traders often engage in \"airdrop farming,\" a strategy to game the token distribution system to acquire more tokens at a project's inception. Similarly, pre-launch futures represent a new avenue for gaining early exposure to nascent, high-profile projects since users can trade them with leverage before launch. Selected pre-launch projects typically generate significant attention leading up to their token generation event (TGE).\n\nIn an era where attention equates to value, innovative perp-exchanges like Aevo and Hyperliquid are leveraging pre-launch futures to carve out a niche in the competitive perpetuals market. The primary advantage of pre-launch perps lies in their ability to attract and retain users by offering access to exclusive assets not available elsewhere. For pre-launch perp, exchanges focus less on trading fees and more on user acquisition and growth, recognizing the long-term value in building a loyal user base.\n\nThe introduction of perpetual pre-launch futures marks a significant shift in the focus of crypto trading platforms. Exchanges are moving away from merely increasing leverage, “1000x leverage”, by embracing innovative ways to trade and offering early access to tokens. This not only caters to the trader's appetite for speculation but also fosters a sense of community and exclusivity among users who are the first to trade these nascent assets.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, platforms that innovate and offer unique features are likely to stand out and thrive. By tapping into the dynamics of user acquisition and the speculative nature of crypto enthusiasts, these platforms are able to acquire new users and stay relevant in a competitive landscape.\n\nWhat are Perpetual Futures\n\nPerpetual futures represent a highly profitable product in the digital asset ecosystem, functioning as derivatives. These contracts derive their value from an underlying asset, for example, digital assets like ETH. Unlike spot exchanges, where you buy or sell actual assets, dealing with perpetual contracts involves trading contracts linked to the value of cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn contrast to standard futures contracts that involve an agreement between a buyer and a seller to exchange a crypto asset at a predetermined future price, perpetual futures contracts add a particular variation. Trading with crypto perps typically occurs close to the underlying asset's current price and what sets them apart is their perpetual nature which lacks an expiry date.\n\nIn practical terms, consider a scenario where Ethereum is priced at $1,000. Sensing a bullish market trend, a trader might leverage perpetual futures contracts to capitalize on potential profits by using leverage. This trader could place an order of 1 ETH at $1,000 using 3x leverage which multiplies the position size by three, leaving the trader with a $3,000 position by using only $1,000 as collateral.\n\nWhile leverage magnifies returns, it also increases the risk of substantial losses, making effective risk management crucial. Perpetual futures often involve funding rates, exchanged between long and short positions to align the contract's price with the underlying asset and traders may pay or receive funding periodically. However, the core allure of perps are using leverage on a variety of assets without having to purchase the underlying asset. \n\nWhat are Pre-Launch Futures\n\nPre-launch token perps are derivative contracts allowing traders to speculate on the future price of a digital asset before it is officially launched. Investors can take positions based on anticipated market value, but it involves risk as actual performance may differ upon launch. These contracts do not grant ownership of the underlying asset, providing flexibility for long or short positions. Since limited information is available pre-launch, traders rely on project details for informed decisions which might include tokenomics, and last raise valuation.\n\nPre-launch futures typically operate without an index price and sometimes without a funding rate. However, upon activation of the token's spot market, exchanges promptly incorporate the index price and implement a funding rate. \n\nIndex Price: Initially absent in these futures, the index price is the average price of the asset across major exchanges and serves as a benchmark for the contract.\n\nFunding Rate: A fee paid to keep a position open, with a positive funding rate, longs pay the shorts and vice versa. The rate incentivizes traders to take long and short positions opposite of where the consensus is.\n\nSpot Market: Markets where the traded assets are immediately delivered to the buyer or seller and not based on contracts.  \n\nSimply put, this implies that pre-launch perp will align with the spot price once the spot market becomes operational, thanks to the funding rate mechanism. Importantly, users can engage in trading before the spot market goes live, allowing them to speculate on the starting/listing price of the token by taking long or short positions on pre-launch token futures.\n\nIn the typical process of launching a new market, exchanges might prioritize the release of tokenomics and wait for token confirmation before enabling trading. Announcing the token supply is a crucial step in this process, since it gives the team and traders a clearer understanding of the expected price of the underlying market. \n\nPrice Discovery\n\nThe initial value of a derivative typically aligns with the protocol's valuation. For instance, if the protocol's valuation is $10 billion with a total token supply of 1 billion, the initial price per token is determined as $10. Nevertheless, its actual value is ultimately shaped by users through long/short positions and the addition of supply and demand. Simply put, market conditions are still a factor. Once the token is introduced and commences trading on an external exchange, the pre-launch token future transforms into a conventional perpetual future.\n\nExchanges are using measures to enhance the price discovery model, transitioning to a more sustainable approach. One example is Hyperliquid’s product, HyperPerps, which we will explore in a subsequent section.\n\nPerformance\n\nConsider the Celestia ($TIA) pre-launch perps as a case in point. If you had purchased $TIA at its lowest point in the Aevo $TIA pre-launch market in early October, your investment would be up 6x by the start of December.\n\nWe can also look at a similar example with $MEME token. If you had acquired $MEME at its minimum value in the Pre-Launch market towards the close of October, your investment would have doubled within the first 10 days of the TGE.\n\nThis highlights the ability of pre-launch perpetuals to enable users to enter the market at a more favorable price before it's TGE, allowing for early exposure to digital assets. Now, let's explore the approaches different protocols take in managing pre-launch perpetuals and dive deep into their solutions. \n\nAevo\n\nOn August 9th, 2023, Aevo revealed the introduction of Aevo pre-launch token futures. The initial token earmarked for trading using this method is $SEI, preceding its official listing on the Binance Exchange. Following the token's launch and commencement of trading on external platforms like Binance, the Aevo Pre-Launch token future transitioned into a conventional perpetual future.\n\nSubsequently, they announced the introduction of BLAST pre-launch futures. However, since the tokenomics had not yet been disclosed, the Aevo Blast market operated under the assumption of a circulating token quantity of 1,000,000,000. For simplified computation, a value of $1 on the $BLAST pre-launch future suggests a fully diluted valuation of $1 billion. Upon the official launch of the $BLAST token, the market will undergo a transition to a conventional perpetual future, incorporating an index price and funding rate.\n\nResponding to market trends and the Solana memecoin euphoria, Aevo made significant announcements on December 2nd, 2023 and December 5th, 2023, introducing pre-launch futures for $JUP and $JITO, capitalizing on hype and momentum.\n\nJupiter Exchange, a prominent Solana decentralized exchange (DEX), is renowned for its popularity, while Jito distinguishes itself by offering MEV rewards through liquid staking.\n\n$JUP is currently trading at ~$0.7, having achieved a 7x increase since the launch of pre-launch perpetuals for Jupiter.\n\nPre-launch token futures on Aevo stand out from regular perpetual futures due to specific features. These include an initial margin of 0.5x, allowing a maximum leverage of 2x, a maintenance margin set at 0.48x, limitations on position sizes, the absence of an index price, and the exclusion of funding payments. Additionally, the contract specifications indicate a 25 basis points (bps) taker fee, a -10 bps rebate for makers, and the use of USDC as the settlement asset.\n\nHyperliquid\n\nThe Hyperliquid protocol introduced a new product known as Hyperperps, representing an enhancement to the traditional pre-launch futures model.\n\nHyperps (Hyperliquid-only perps) function similarly to perpetual contracts but deviate as they do not rely on an underlying spot or index oracle price. Instead, the funding rate is calculated in relation to a moving average hyperp mark price, offering greater stability and reduced susceptibility to manipulation compared to conventional pre-launch futures.\n\nThis novel derivative design eliminates the necessity for an underlying asset or index to exist throughout the entire hyperp's lifespan. Hyperps only require the underlying asset or index price for settlement and conversion to a normal perp. When engaging in hyperp trading, careful consideration of funding rates is crucial. Intense price momentum in one direction incentivizes positions in the opposite direction during the next eight hours. It is therefore essential to evaluate the opportunity thoroughly before participating in hyperp trading.\n\nOnce ABC/USDT is listed for spot trading on platforms like Binance, OKX, or Bybit, the Hyperperp tracking ABC (e.g., ABC = ZRO, TIA, PYTH, or JUP) will transition into a standard ABC-USD perpetual contract.\n\nHyperp Mechanism Simplified:\n\nBasic Concept: Hyperps are similar to regular perpetual contracts but with a unique approach to price determination.\n\nPrice Calculation: Hyperps use an 8-hour exponentially weighted moving average of the last day's minutely mark prices. This average considers recent prices more heavily, shaping the current price.\n\nThe Equation: oracle_price(t) = ... calculates the price at time 't'. It involves the sum of mark prices with an exponential decay factor, preventing extreme price influence. If there are under 480 mark price samples, the initial mark price fills the gaps. A safeguard ensures the final price doesn't exceed 4 times the initial mark price.\n\nSampling Method: Prices are sampled at the first block after each minute, with timestamps rounded to the nearest exact minute.\n\nFunding Rate Premium: Calculated as one-fifth of the normal interest rate and premium formula used in funding.\n\nAs an illustration, Hyperliquid unveiled pre-launch perpetual contracts for LayerZero ($ZRO) on September 7th, 2023. For $ZRO, the conversion occurs when the maximum supply is 2 billion, and the assets launches. In cases where the max supply differs, ZRO-USD will settle based on the fully diluted valuation (FDV) divided by 2 billion, one week following the CEX listing. Following settlement, the hyperperp will be delisted and a new standard perpetual contract will be introduced. Regardless of the scenario, the price of the ZRO-USD Hyperperp ultimately aligns with the spot ZRO price after the token's existence.\n\nTo sum up, hyperps function similarly to standard perpetual contracts, with the distinction that the external spot/index oracle price is substituted by an 8-hour exponentially weighted moving average derived from the minutely mark prices of the preceding day.\n\nHelix\n\nHelix Exchange, a perps exchange on injective, was the first one to introduce the pre-launch futures market for Celestia ($TIA). Since early access to assets is traditionally reserved for insiders, early contributors, or VCs. Helix notes they aim to disrupt by allowing decentralized trading of upcoming tokens before their official launch. This would make trading fairer by allowing all types of traders to participate in the market for highly anticipated tokens before they become widely available.\n\nOn November 19th, 2023, Helix also revealed the launch of a market for the unreleased $PYTH token. Pyth Network is Solana’s native oracle network which streams financial market data to protocols, which was one of the largest token launched on Solana in 2023.\n\nAssociated Risks\n\nTrading pre-launch perpetuals comes with certain risks that investors should carefully consider. Some of the key risks include:\n\nDuration and Project Development Risks: Delays, technical issues, or changes in project direction can impact the value of the pre-launch perps. For instance, if the project delays the launch by multiple quarters, traders might be paying a higher funding rate to keep the position open and at the whim of the project launching ultimately setting them back on the trade even if they are correct on timing. \n\nFees: On some exchanges, like Hyperliquid, users could be subject to increased fees based on the funding rate pricing model. \n\nPrice Volatility: Perps can be highly volatile, as they are influenced by factors such as market speculation, early investor sentiment, and uncertainties surrounding the project's development,  leading to significant price fluctuations.\n\nLiquidity Risks: The liquidity of pre-launch perps may be lower compared to more established assets. Limited trading volume can result in larger bid-ask spreads and difficulty executing trades at desired prices. For instance BLAST-USD on Aevo has only $3,000 in 24 hour trading volume, which is very small in comparison to other markets of listed assets. \n\nLimited Trading History: challenging for traders to analyze historical price trends and patterns using technical analysis.\n\nConclusion\n\nPerpetual decentralized exchanges (perp DEXs) allow users to engage in on-chain trading of crypto derivatives. Perps, or perpetual futures, function as derivatives within the digital ecosystem. Crypto perps notably do not have an end date and allow the use of leverage on various assets without needing to purchase the asset itself. \n\nPre-launch futures represent a way to gain early exposure to new projects, providing users with the opportunity to trade with leverage before launch. $TIA and $MEME display the ability of pre-launch perpetuals to allow traders to engage with digital assets. Aevo introduced pre-launch futures in 2023, capitalizing on hyped upcoming token launches and offering unique features for traders. \n\nHyperps are similar to perpetual contracts as they do not depend on an underlying spot or index oracle price. Instead, the funding rate is based upon a moving average hyperp mark price. Hyperliquid’s pre-launch perpetual contracts for LayerZero ($ZRO) is an example of this process.\n\nIt is important to note that trading pre-launch perpetuals come with risks that investors should carefully consider. In this article, we covered price discovery, performance, and risks associated with trading pre-launch futures, delving into main protocols which, despite their similar designs, exhibit notable distinctions.\n\nSources\n\nDemex Introduces STRK Perpetuals As A Pre-Launch Market\n\nIntroducing Helix Pre-Launch Futures\n\nSpotlight: Helix Launches Pre-Launch Futures, listing Celestia (TIA) as its first market\n\nPre-Launch Token Futures - Aevo Documentation\n\nNot financial or tax advice. The purpose of this newsletter is purely educational and should not be considered as investment advice, legal advice, a request to buy or sell any assets, or a suggestion to make any financial decisions.

Its integrated architecture, which is distinctly separate from that of EVM chains, enables developers to focus on building ready-to-use applications in Rust. Solana currently serves 121 protocols across its ecosystem, secured by 2,156 validators (2nd most behind Ethereum), and holds the 5th most DeFi TVL across blockchains at $1.38B. \n\nSolana has faced and overcome a great deal of adversity in its short but eventful history: from technical issues such as network instability to broader issues such as a hazardous relationship with SBF and Alameda which prompted a mass exodus of users, developers, and liquidity from the chain following the collapse of FTX. Nonetheless, co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko alongside a tight-knit community of users and developers remained positive and forward-thinking even at the lowest of times, demonstrating Solana resiliency and willingness to adapt and overcome adversity; a strong positive indicator for future ecosystem investment opportunities. \n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

The price of $SOL followed in hot pursuit, spurring a face-melting rally that saw the price jump from $9.98 on January 1 2023, to $101.51 mark on January 1 2024, marking a 917.134% return. Ironically, narrative tends to follow price in crypto sometimes, and as SOL gradually continued its strong upwards momentum in the markets, MadLads mint went live, teams began announcing points programs and airdrops, and an emerging narrative around building applications Only Possible On Solana due the network’s unique architecture design began to encapsulate the attention of users, investors, and developers alike. \n\nSolana DeFi in 2023 \n\nFrom January 1, 2023, to January 1, 2024, Solana recorded a significant increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) as well as its on-chain trading metrics. This period marks a significant phase in Solana's development, characterized by a substantial increase in both the value and volume of transactions despite its TVL decline following the FTX crash.\n\nKey Highlights:\n\nTVL Growth: Solana's TVL grew from $210.08 million to approximately $1.47 billion, marking an impressive 574% increase.\n\nTotal Swaps: There were 314,556,244 swaps executed on the network.\n\nTotal Trading Volume: The platform's total trading volume reached $42,036,692,506.\n\nSolana’s monthly DEX volume reached $23.8b in December, marking a yearly high going into the new year. \n\nIntroduction to Jupiter\n\nJupiter launched in September 2021 as a DEX aggregator on Solana, with the purpose of providing a better trading experience for Solana users by routing liquidity from multiple sources as opposed to one. Though Jupiter was initially only a swap engine, the protocol has evolved to offer a number of different products for different users and has become a critical liquidity layer for the Solana ecosystem. \n\nThree core anchors drive Jupiter’s business model:\n\n 1.  Delivering the best UX possible \n\n2.  Maximizing the potential of Solana’s technical capabilities \n\n3.  Improving Solana’s liquidity landscape as a whole \n\n2023 was a busy year for the Jupiter team, which shipped a handful of new core product offerings including a new DCA feature, limit orders, and perpetuals trading. There were a handful of various upgrades and optimizations within the core protocol as well, including an upgraded algorithm (Metis), a Bridge comparator tool, instant staked SOL > SOL swaps, and more developer tooling including the release of Jupiter Terminal and 2 major API upgrades. \n\nJupiter 2023 Review: Volume  \n\nJupiter’s $62,816,562,781 Total Volume accounts ~60% of all Solana DEX volume. \n\nJupiter monthly volume grew 994.48% from $649,258,200.00  on Jan 2023 > to  $7,106,000,000.00 in December 2023. November volume exceeded $16B following the $JUP announcement at Breakpoint, marking a new all time high in monthly volume. Even more impressively, much of this uptick in volume (mainly Q4) came from organic trading activity \n\nIn this report, we unpack Jupiter’s product line and future plans, and explain the rationale behind our investment approach. \n\nAMMs and Aggregators\n\nAutomated Market makers (AMMs) have been a novel innovation in the past few years in the digital asset space. On traditional exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, third party entities operate to provide liquidity so traders have a counterparty, which is the other side of the trade. These counterparties are known as market makers, since they “make” a market for traders to trade against, whilst taking a spread (fee) on each trade to remain profitable. With the advent of AMMs, traders can deploy digital assets that are market-made by math and code instead of sophisticated middlemen. By using AMMs, traders can enter and exit positions even with extremely low liquidity. One downside with low liquidity is that traders will experience slippage, which is the difference between expected and realized trade value. Traders can also lose value on a trade through the exploitation of information asymmetries in the public mempool, e.g. being front-run or sandwiched by sophisticated actors deploying MEV bots. \n\nOn-chain aggregators emerged to mitigate the impact of low liquidity trades by enabling traders to place orders which route liquidity from multiple sources as opposed to one. Liquidity can be pulled from a variety of sources including AMMs; though a number of teams have built solutions which enable market-makers to tap into off-chain liquidity (i.e. a CEX position) as well to help settle trades. \n\nThe primary benefit to this is better pricing as:\n\nNo gas costs incurred for CEX > on-chain transfers\n\n Trades are not subject to MEV extraction. \n\nAs a whole, aggregators were built to deliver a better user-experience; large content platforms such as Meta or YouTube serve as aggregators for content, where users can view videos and images from many different obscure websites and sources without having to leave the interface to visit those external websites. Google aggregates information relevant to your search query across many different websites on the internet to deliver the best match in order of relevance. Similarly, Jupiter and other DEX aggregators source liquidity across multiple venues to offer better pricing for traders on their swaps. \n\nBuilding On The SVM \n\nTo better understand Jupiter as a protocol, it is important to understand the role of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and how it influences protocol design choices that developers must make. \n\nA Virtual Machine can best be described as one single entity maintained by thousands of connected computers running a validator client of a given chain, e.g. Ethereum, and is the environment in which all smart contracts and accounts actually exist. To this day, the majority of DeFi and other on-chain activity lives and breathes through the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). However, though further out of the spotlight, we believe the SVM also features a robust architecture that is bound to continue to onboard more developers seeking to build consumer-centric applications optimized for speed and performance. \n\nSmart contract code written in Rust, C, C++  is compiled into BPF bytecode by the SVM. The Sealevel engine is the key component to enabling parallel processing on Solana; as state access lists are integrated into Solana transactions (transactions include details around the particular state to be accessed) -  this lets non-conflicting transactions run simultaneously, enabling for faster overall performance. \n\nWhereas the EVM is a \"single-threaded\" runtime environment, meaning it can only process one contract at a time, the SVM is multi-threaded and can process more transactions in significantly less time. Each thread contains a queue of transactions waiting to be executed, with transactions randomly assigned to a queue.\n\nThe emergence of L2s like Eclipse and Nitro, which utilize the SVM for execution, demonstrate the potential for further adoption of the SVM. Rune Christensen from MakerDAO sparked a lot of debate on Crypto Twitter earlier this year when he proposed his vision for utilizing the Solana codebase for the development of MakerDAO’s app-chain. \n\nOne of the most common gripes with Ethereum is that gas fees increase with user activity, making for an unpleasant user experience at most times but especially amid a bull market. Irrespective of gas costs, traders’ needs are quite simple - to receive the best quote possible for their trade. Aggregators like 1inch were built to help deliver better pricing to users by pulling liquidity from multiple sources as opposed to one specific DEX; however, transacting on Ethereum, e.g. pulling liquidity from multiple different pools, is a costly endeavor and can actually worsen the problem intended to be solved - it can actually be more beneficial to trade on Uniswap where liquidity is only pulled once. \n\nMeanwhile, the opposite holds true on Solana, where gas costs less than a penny by default. The cost of pulling liquidity from multiple sources is virtually no different than pulling from one, and therefore a DEX aggregator is much more pragmatic and beneficial on a chain like Solana than an EVM chain. As the leading aggregator on Solana, we believe Jupiter is much better poised to see significant growth and adoption than aggregators on EVM chains in the long-term, which face higher costs and greater competition. \n\nThe same notion applies to alternative use-cases beyond simple A for B swaps, such as structured Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) or Time Weighted Average Price (TWAP) products for users, which will be further elaborated on below. The underlying principle remains that low gas costs unlock a great deal of flexibility for application developers on Solana, and Jupiter is a premier example of this in action. \n\nProduct Overview\nJupiter Swap\n\nLike any other decentralized trading venue, the most common use-case on Jupiter is the simple token A -> token B swap. Users can enjoy swapping for their favorite assets at competitive prices. Slippage and priority fee settings are completely customizable, general settings enable users to opt in to a direct liquidity route, to use wSOL instead of SOL, and to use versioned Txs (using the newer and better routing algorithm). \n\nDevelopers can also take advantage of the Swap API to natively integrate Jupiter’s routing algorithm into their dApp - Kamino Finance uses Jupiter’s Swap API to enable features like single-sided deposits into their CLMM vaults (Autoswap). \n\nJupiter currently does not charge any additional protocol fees for swaps on top of the base gas fee and associated DEX fees, though we believe that continuous growth and sustainable adoption of Jupiter and Solana DeFi can prompt the JUP DAO to vote to implement a fee at some point in the future. It will be interesting to consider how this decision may be influenced by increased network activity driving up blockspace demand and costs, and by a potential restructuring of Solana fee markets. Currently, the 1inch aggregator on Ethereum does not charge a swap fee, while CowSwap has recently proposed a fee switch which would collect swap fees with the goal to be financially self-sustainable while keeping users incentivized.\n\nLimit Orders\n\nInstead of buying an asset at the current market price, traders who believe the price of the asset will change in the near-future can place limit orders. As a signed message with defined trade execution guidelines, or an “intent”, limit orders offer traders flexibility among a handful of other benefits such as better price settlement due to protection from MEV-induced slippage. This model benefits retail traders and institutions alike, and Jupiter now offers a venue for traders to place limit orders on Solana. \n\nWhen a user places an order to purchase 1 SOL worth of $WIF, the order is ultimately matched by a keeper, a trusted protocol actor responsible for monitoring prices and executing orders. Keepers function in a similar way to solvers on CoWSwap or fillers on UniswapX. Upon execution of an order, the specified assets will appear in the user’s wallet. \n\nJupiter’s Limit Order function provides access to a wider range of token selections; as long as there is sufficient liquidity in the market, the token pair will be accessible to trade. Furthermore, users can specify an expiration time in their order, upon which any unfilled orders are canceled and refunded to the user’s wallet. \n\nDCA\n\nDollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is a common investment strategy which involves splitting the allocation of capital over multiple trades as opposed to one; this is perfectly suited for long-term investors who are not concerned with short term volatility (e.g. buy $500 of SOL over 5 days). DCA can be useful for accumulating an asset during a bear market - the principle is to average out one’s entry price to mitigate volatility and generate greater returns over the course of time and change in market conditions. Likewise, DCA can also be helpful for taking profits in a bull market - instead of immediately selling off one’s position entirely, the DCA can help spread out sells to capture any additional upside that may occur during the unwinding. \n\nTraders also can perform weighted average price strategies (TWAPs) to buy or sell assets. TWAPs, similar to DCAing, is used typically for large orders that need to be broken up into smaller parts to prevent price impact from buying all at once which can result in slippage (loss of funds). Since orders are executed for a period of time they resemble a DCA strategy of buying “x” amount over a certain time period. \n\nJupiter is one of a few platforms that has enabled users to execute frequent time-bound strategies on-chain, due to Solana’s high-throughput architecture (Drip Protocol was the original!). Performing a DCA with low time-frame transactions on Ethereum, e.g. daily, can result in hundreds of dollars in transaction fees versus fractions of cents on solana. Even on L2 if traders wanted to execute 10 trades over 1 hour the fees could quickly add up. \n\nPerpetuals \n\nTo further add to their extensive product suite, Jupiter has also launched an LP <> Traders Perpetuals exchange earlier this year. Though still in beta, traders can trade SOL, ETH, and wBTC perps with up to 100x leverage, while LPs can lend capital to earn fees. \n\nPerpetuals are derivatives contracts resembling traditional Futures, which enable traders to take on a greater position with less allocated capital (leverage) for the purpose of capitalizing on a future price movement. \n\nOn Jupiter, traders can open long or short positions on SOL, ETH, and wBTC using virtually any supported Solana token as collateral. Long positions require the corresponding underlying (e.g. a long SOL-USD position would require SOL collateral), meanwhile short positions require stablecoins as collateral. Traders can take on leverage by borrowing assets from the liquidity pool - a position on SOL-USD can be leveraged by 2x by borrowing 1x of SOL from the JLP pool. \n\nSimilar to the dynamics of the GLP pool on the perps exchange GMX, Jupiter Perps utilizes the JLP pool, which consists of SOL, ETH, WBTC, USDC, and USDT. Providing liquidity is simply done by depositing any supported Solana token into the JLP pool in exchange for an equivalent amount in $JLP token. The JLP pool receives 70% of fees generated on Jupiter perps , and the price of $JLP grows congruently with the value of the underlying pool. \n\nThe JLP pool also benefits the greater Solana ecosystem, as Jupiter Swap is natively integrated into the perps exchange, meaning not only can any token be used as JLP collateral, but that Solana traders can benefit from better pricing for their swaps from the increased liquidity from the JLP pool.  \n\nUnlike the aforementioned features, Jupiter’s perpetual exchange charges more fees for traders and LPs alike. Traders pay an hourly borrow fee, or a funding rate, to the pool based on the hourly borrow rate, position size, and token utilization percentage, which can be expressed as: \n\n Funding rate = (tokens borrowed / tokens in the pool) * 0.01% * position size\n\nLPs pay their own share of fees as well, for opening/closing a position, and swapping for different assets within the JLP pool:  \n\nWith regards to the JLP pool, it should also be noted that given the target ratios established for each token in the pool, any logic which moves the token's ratio away from the target incurs greater fees while logic that moves the ratio closer to the target incurs a fee discount. \n\nDecentralized perpetuals exchanges, popularized by GMX and dYdX, are still generally underdeveloped compared to their CEX counterparts and have lots of room for growth and adoption. Perps are another example of a low-latency application which benefits from Solana’s fast execution and low transaction costs, though Jupiter will face competition from established players in the Solana Perps sector such as Drift Protocol, 01 Exchange, Zeta Markets, Mango,  among others. \n\nGrowing The Pie: The Jupiter Vision 🥧\n\nWhen the pie grows, everyone gets more pie. \n\nP - Product\n\nI - Incentive \n\nE- Education \n\nAs a critical part of the Solana ecosystem, Jupiter benefits from helping onboard as many new users and developers to the ecosystem as possible. Beyond providing value through great products, Jupiter’s goal is to empower its community and the broader Solana ecosystem through several new initiatives: \n\n$JUP: Governance token for the new DAO (more below) \n\nJupiter Start: It’s imperative for ecosystems seeking sustainable growth to strike a balance between keeping an open mind towards innovation, and being objectively critical of poor application design and weary of teams seeking to capitalize on narrative and recency bias within the markets. \n\nJupiter Start aims to be a collaborative effort between the Jupiter community and the broader Solana ecosystem to “help vet, debate, understand, and highlight great new projects”. This entails the Jupiter launchpad to help bootstrap new projects, pre-listing trading availability for new tokens, and Atlas, a new public seed-funding initiative to allow the community to invest in early-stage projects, as well as various community-centric educational initiatives. \n\nWe recommend reading this blog post if you are interested in learning more. \n\nJupiter Labs: A collective effort between the Jupiter team, community, and DAO to develop innovative products and tools for Solana DeFi. Although these initiatives will begin native to Jupiter, they are ultimately designed to launch and operate as independent protocols on Solana. Jupiter users will be granted priority access to early product testing and consequently benefit from associated incentives for doing so, part of which will be allocated towards the JUP DAO. \n\nThe first product to already go live is the Perpetuals exchange, which is already live in beta, and a proposal for sUSD, a SOL-backed stablecoin (like LUSD:ETH) which uses leveraged LSTs to generate yield. \n\nMore on $JUP \n\nJupiter announced the $JUP token during Solana breakpoint, a strategic decision which was made after the protocol reached numerous critical milestones including a broad and engaged user base, several major platform upgrades and new products, a pipeline of ecosystem projects, all of which of course, is part of an overarching conviction in the future uptick of activity on Solana. \n\nWith a max. supply of 10 billion JUP, the token distribution is equally split between 2 cold wallets - the team wallet, and the community wallet. The team wallet will be used for allocations for the current team, treasury, and liquidity provision, while the community wallet is geared towards airdrops and various early contributors. \n\n15% - 17.5% of the tokens will be liquid from day one, 10% - 7.5% in warm wallets, and 75% to be in cold storage. \n\nThe airdrops will consist of retroactive airdrops to engage a whopping 955k early users of Jupiter (pre-Nov 2nd), as well as growth airdrops aimed to help attract new users and liquidity, and to form the JUP DAO itself. The DAO will then vote on the token unlock data, The token will be initially locked, and the unlock date to be set by the DAO. JUP holders will have the ability to vote on various critical facets of Jupiter protocol and the role of the token, including the timing of the initial liquidity provision, future emissions scheduling, which projects to be featured on Jupiter Start, among others. \n\n“The initial value of JUP will be a symbol for Jupiter and DeFi 2.0, much as the value for UNI is a symbol for Uniswap DeFi 1.0.” \n\nFundamental Investment Catalysts\n\nNow that we have covered the components of Jupiter protocol, we can break down the long-term investment opportunity we envision. \n\nThe Solana Bet \n\nSolana’s roadmap is an ambitious and exciting one, and we expect ecosystem activity to continue to grow throughout 2024, building on the momentum gained in Q4 2023. The main catalysts driving our conviction:\n\nMore Airdrops: Marginfi and a handful of other DeFi teams sparked a flame in the Solana ecosystem with the onset of Points programs (many of which have yet to see their final form!) earlier near the summer of 2023. The JTO airdrop exacerbated the already growing momentum on Solana with a wealth effect that left not only left many jitoSOL stakers happy, but also left many individuals unsatisfied and looking for the next big opportunity. Starting with Jupiter ($JUP), others to keep an eye on would be Kamino, Marginfi, Drift, Tensor, and more. \n\nFiredancer: Jump Crypto’s highly anticipated validator client, which Toly himself has deemed “Solana 2.0” . Firedancer is expected to be a long-term beneficial initiative for Solana’s performance and throughput as the network scales and evolves, and it marks a crucial milestone for Solana as it increases client diversity and thus mitigates the risk of a single point of failure for the network. Low-latency applications will become that much faster, an attractive selling point for both users and developers. As 2024 will likely be the year Firedancer goes live, we expect a lot of speculation and growing interest around this milestone. \n\nDePin: This is a novel sector in crypto which exemplifies how tokenized assets can be used help decentralize real-world business models. Solana has managed to attract a number of projects including Helium and Hivemapper. Interest around DePin as an emerging sector brings more positive attention to Solana in turn, as the network demonstrates its utility to serve more tangible use-cases. \n\nPayments: Solana Pay is now integrated with Shopify, meaning merchants can accept payments on Solana, meaning the average JTO airdrop recipient could’ve technically bought 2000+ coffees with their earnings. Though there are still hurdles to overcome for actually getting shoppers to make payments in Solana Pay, a partnership with the largest ecommerce platform is a good way to start. Additionally, earlier this year Visa, one of the largest global payment networks, announced its plans for leveraging Solana for its Stablecoin Settlement Pilot - an experiment testing the capabilities of blockchain settlement rails for building new products for commerce and money movement. Solana’s high throughput, fast finality, low transaction costs, and node availability are all positives for Visa, the same way Visa’s brand is a positive for bringing a lot of attention to Solana. If successful, we believe the Stablecoin Settlement Pilot will mark a major milestone for the development of real-world crypto use-cases, and Solana stands to benefit as being the de facto network making this happen. \n\nA final honorable mention is the Saga Phone. While Solana’s mobile phone may not have been a home run in its first year, a push for mobile-friendly crypto environments and applications can be a very exciting development in the long-term when considering what mobile integration did for social media and payment apps. Excitement has picked up recently as the Solana phone airdropped BONK to purchasers (technically you could buy the phone and pay it off immediately at one point…) , and the team just recently announced “Chapter 2” which entails a cheaper price ($450) and a referral leaderboard to incentivize more users. \n\nChallenges for Solana \n\nWhile we remain bullish on Solana’s long-term growth, there are several critical concerns we expect the Solana core team and developer community to address in the near and long term, which we will be keeping an eye on: \n\nFee Market: Though Solana has introduced priority fees now, there is no native mechanism for determining a ‘market’ priority fee which helps rate limit spammers efficiently (i.e. EIP-1559). As there is now much greater demand for blockspace on Solana, more users are experiencing failed transactions, further demonstrating the need for an upgrade to the network’s current fee market structure. Proposed solutions involve dynamic account fees, and a multi-dimensional EIP-1559 with exponentially increasing fees for every account touching the exact same hotspot. \n\nEVM Competition: Though we believe in the long-term SVM vs EVM will not be a zero-sum dynamic and the different networks will specialize in their own respective categories, today Solana is still competing with EVM landscape for market share and users, a large gap to close ($1.4b > $30b). \n\nEIP-4844 aims to make L2s significantly (80-90%!) cheaper and easier to use/deploy, which can reaffirm strong market leaders in Arbitrum, Optimism and Base. Similarly, Celestia brings more flexibility and lower costs for L2 developers, which can potentially attract talent and users away from Solana. \n\nRestaking narrative stands to be one of the biggest catalysts for Ethereum and will likely bring in a lot of capital inflows there as well. Security risks aside, investors who are seeking native yield on a native L1 asset will seek opportunities for higher returns, which restaking provides for Ethereum stakers. \n\nParallel-Execution L1s: The rising popularity of parallel-execution L1 chains (MoveVM, Sei, Monad) which optimize for speed and performance similar to Solana are still young and underdeveloped, and could see their own . Monad, built by a handful of team members with HFT backgrounds, aims to bring Solana-like performance to the EVM environment, theoretically uniting “the best of both worlds” and delivering upwards of 10K TPS. Nonetheless, these chains not only face an uphill climb against Solana itself, but they must also compete with Neon EVM, which enables Solana compatibility through an Ethereum native environment. Aave has recently published a proposal on its governance forum to discuss deploying its V3 protocol on Neon mainnet. \n\nWith all this in mind, we consider Solana’s resiliency, demonstrated in its ability to overcome macro challenges such as the FTX collapse, or technical shortcomings such as network outages, the network’s greatest strength and long-term catalyst. \n\nThe Solana Bet = The Jupiter Bet\n\n“Our vision for the future is intrinsically tied to the growth and prosperity of the Solana ecosystem. We are driven by the conviction that a flourishing Solana ecosystem translates to collective benefits for all stakeholders involved. In simple terms, when the pie grows, everyone gets more pie.” - Jupiter Green Paper \n\nWe believe Jupiter’s critical role in the Solana DeFi landscape makes it a viable bet on the network’s near and long-term adoption. The thesis is quite simple. More users on Solana = more users on Jupiter. Solana’s initial boom lasted for the better part of the first year it was live (2021), during which protocols like Saber and Serum dominated the DEX landscape. Jupiter gained traction shortly after its launch given its USP for Solana DeFi, which sought to utilize on-chain liquidity from DEXs rather than steal market share from them, for the end-goal of providing a better user experience with better pricing. However, it wasn’t until the sunset of Serum, the once-dominant Solana DEX, that Jupiter had emerged to be the market leader they are today. \n\nJupiter consistently made up over 60% of organic DEX volume on Solana throughout 2023. \n\nBreaking Down Jupiter’s Business Model \n\nInitially, Jupiter’s core product was simply a swap engine which optimized for better pricing and did not charge any additional fees for traders. As the project began to grow and see continuous growth in volume and traders, the team launched a handful of new products which now serve as organic revenue streams for the protocol via fees. We believe the JUP DAO will naturally seek to ensure $JUP holders receive a given % of these fees, as well as future opportunities with Jupiter Start and Jupiter Labs. \n\nLimit Orders: 30 BPS\n\nDCA: 10 BPS \n\nThis is a unique offering which I think Jupiter can take further advantage of by raising the fee (~20 BPS)\n\nPerps\n\nOpening/Closing a Position: 10 BPS \n\nSwap Fee: 0 - 200 BPS (varies by pool weight) \n\nBorrow Rate = 1 BPS / hour * token utilization % \n\n70% of fees generated go towards \n\nExternal protocols \n\nIf a protocol integrates Jupiter’s architecture into their own software and then charges their own fee, Jupiter ensures they receive a share of the fees as well. \n\nHypotheticals \n\nJupiter Start - We believe it may be prudent to utilize Jupiter Start initiatives, namely the Launchpad and Atlas, towards creating an additional revenue stream for Jupiter and $JUP holders. \n\nLaunchpad: Establish deal-flow or projects incubated by the Jupiter Launchpad, where a portion of a project’s revenue goes towards the JUP DAO. \n\nAtlas: Create an efficient model for collecting revenue from realized gains on public seed-funding initiatives to be distributed among holders and investors who participated.  \n\nJupiter Labs - As already demonstrated by Perps, Jupiter Labs supports the development of protocols which can generate additional revenue for Jupiter. \n\nAnother proposal is in the works for sUSD \n\nAn interesting question to consider here is how exactly will these initiatives one day launch and operate independently, as stated in the Jupiter docs, and how will doing so influence that particular revenue stream. \n\nSwap Fee\n\nJupiter’s swap engine has been the core product that Solana users have grown to know and love. However, as fee dynamics on Solana continue to evolve, trading will inevitably become costlier as more smart contracts compete for fewer blockspace. Jupiter has already positioned itself to allow traders to pay priority fees for faster execution, and if this feature sees continuous adoption from this point onwards, it makes sense to charge an extra % for the service Jupiter is providing (there is no native way to calculate the “base” priority fee). \n\nCompetitive Landscape for Jupiter \n\nGenerally speaking, we believe Jupiter’s role as an aggregator is in a unique position as it does not face direct competition with any one trading protocol on Solana at this time. That said, as the Solana DEX landscape continues to evolve as the demand for low-latency trading applications grows, Jupiter will naturally face the challenge of keeping up with the latest innovations and developments. At the end of the day, traders want better settlement and will go where that is the case. \n\nFurthermore, Jupiter faces greater competition for its additional products such as Perps, and teams are generally going to be incentivized to recreate a DCA product or similar. \n\nThe DEX landscape on Solana is evolving and becoming more competitive. Outside Solana, it’s even more competitive. \n\nJupiter’s competitive edge lies in price settlement for users; if a protocol emerges to offer better pricing users flock there more likely than not. \n\nSwaps are still main use case; swap engine performance is key \n\nNiche products (perps, limit orders, dca) have stronger competition and competitors can offer lower fees\n\nSuggestions for Jupiter \n\nMore transparency around fees and revenue, and product performance data dashboard would be helpful for investors. \n\n$JUP holders should be a beneficiary of Jupiter’s revenue streams (Limit Order, DCA, Perps, Jupiter Start + Labs) \n\nMonitor the intents landscape and consider a routing model which utilizes off-chain liquidity (i.e. CEX LP inventory) in addition to on-chain liquidity to provide better pricing for users. Similar to 1inch Fusion, Matcha by 0x, CoWSwap, etc. \n\nThis would apply for swaps, limit orders, DCA \n\nEnsure $JUP holders receive a % of revenue generated by Jupiter Labs products and services. \n\nEnsure any team which Jupiter Start either incubates by launchpad or public seed-funding, which implements a fee on their protocol, allocates a  % to $JUP holders\n\nEnsure the large size of the airdrop distribution does not dilute the quality of participants who represent the JUP DAO. \n\nFuture Outlook\n\nGiven its unique position in its ecosystem, we believe Jupiter is a viable bet on Solana’s near and long-term adoption. As network activity on Solana continues to pick up, we expect Jupiter to capture a significant portion of inflow value with its established ecosystem presence, suite of various products, and a sustainable revenue model which should benefit $JUP holders long-term as well. As Larry Fink begins to talk about the tokenization of every financial asset, \n\nand L1 blockchains like Solana continue to seek PMF and explore new utilities and innovations, it’s not too far-fetched to imagine Jupiter accommodating a variety of new asset classes over time. \n\nSources\n\nJupiter Green Paper\n\nhttps://station.jup.ag/blog/dca-official-launch\n\nWhat Is SVM - The Solana Virtual Machine - Squads Blog\n\n Meow here.

In many situations, incentives might be subtle or too complex to perceive, but in finance, it's often more straightforward — people want to maximize their profits and minimize their losses. \n\nDecentralized Finance — DeFi — cuts out the middlemen, simplifying the link between incentives and outcomes. Seeing assets moving from protocol to protocol, fresh money coming in, and money coming out is like seeing human behavior at its rawest and clearest form: when there's a clear reward, people act. This clarity around rewards, the low barrier of entry, and, of course, the promise of a high yield is what's driven DeFi's rapid growth. \n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

Or simply deposit it in a smart contract (in the case of stables or other DeFi strategies).\n\nMarket Making: Providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges — DEXs — for smoother trades, earning some of the trading fees.\n\nLending Platforms: Lending your assets on smart contracts to earn interest, a decentralized money market with its own set of risks.\n\nTokenized Real-World Assets: Keep your money on-chain and gain exposure to TradFi investments, like bonds, for example.\n\nTo understand how investors currently allocate their stables in smart contracts, we’ve prepared Table 1, which outlines all those different sources of yields on the Ethereum mainnet. The columns depict the following: \n\nThe project behind a certain strategy;\n\nThe symbol (tick) of the tokens used in the strategy.\n\nThe Total Value Locked (TVL) indicates the aggregate amount (in dollar terms) invested in the strategy.\n\nThe Annual Percentage Yield (APY) denotes the expected yearly return.\n\nTable 1 - Sources of yield for Stablecoin in the Ethereum Mainnet. Data - DeFi Llama.\n\nThe first thing that gets our attention when analyzing the data of this table is how dominant MakerDAO’s DAI (DSR) strategy is, with an APY of 5% and 1.6 billion dollars deposited in its contracts. It represents a staggering 52% of the sum of the entire market other than this strategy represented by this table. The Dai Savings Rate (DSR) within the MakerDAO ecosystem allows DAI stablecoin holders to earn interest on their DAI through a combination of off-chain and on-chain yield strategies, including ETH staking and treasury yields. \n\nBut it has not always been like this. \n\nDai Savings Rate — DSR — TVL has been growing rapidly, especially since August 2023. In Chart 1, we can visualize the TVL by type of yield strategy and how they have changed in the past year. We can see how the AMM and Lending TVLs have significantly declined in that time. \n\nChart 1 - TVL of the 25 biggest sources of yield on the Ethereum mainnet, by type. Data - DeFi Llama.\n\nChart 2 makes it more clear how the total TVL of the studied protocols has ranged from 3 to 4 billion dollars and how there is a significant change in the composition of the aggregate TVL, with collateralized debt positions, referred to as CDPs (DSR) gaining a substantial part of it. CDPs function as decentralized financial instruments that are secured through the on-chain pledging of other assets. In this study, the DSR is a CDP backed by a combination of on-chain and off-chain assets.\n\nChart 2 - Stacked Area chart of the TVL of the 25 biggest sources of yield on the Ethereum mainnet, by type. Data - DeFi Llama.\n\nIt is clear that something is happening for this composition change to occur. Still, to understand the behind the scenes of this phenomenon, it is crucial to understand the behavior of the yields of the money market and how they have reacted to DSR. Chart 3 describes this.\n\nChart 3 - APY of several money market strategies on the Ethereum Mainnet with its overall trendline, and DSR’s APY hikes. Data - Dune Analytics.\n\nThe APYs of different money markets (minus DSR APY) on the Ethereum mainnet are represented on the chart. The plot is composed of three sections separated by colors, divided by two events (dotted lines): the hikes of the Dai Savings Rate on June 19th and August 6th. \n\nThe Overall Trend represented by the dotted blue line makes it more evident what is happening. The APY trend of all other money market protocols has doubled; investors seem to have removed their positions from money markets and invested it somewhere else (probably DSR), until it reached a new equilibrium. It looks like DSR is dictating the rates, and the money market is converging with the DSR.\n\nBut why exactly is this happening?\n\nThe Ideal of Convergence\n\nBefore diving deeper into why these rates converge at a new equilibrium dictated by DSR, it is important to understand the ideal of convergence.\n\nTheoretical Fundamentals of Yield Convergence in a Perfect Market\n\nIn economic literature, the Law of One Price posits that in a frictionless and perfectly competitive market, identical goods or assets will have the same price. Extending this to DeFi (and yields), in a perfect market scenario, yields across various asset categories (like stablecoins) and protocols should converge to a single rate. This is because, in such a market, all participants have access to the same information and can move assets freely without any barriers, leading to a single equilibrium yield.\n\nThe Role of Arbitrage in Pushing Rates Towards Convergence\n\nArbitrage plays a pivotal role in driving the convergence of yields. When there's a discrepancy in yields between two similar assets or platforms, informed investors can move their funds from the strategy, paying lower yields, and deposit in the one with the higher yield. This movement naturally pushes the yields of the two assets closer together until the opportunity for yield arbitrage diminishes. The continual pursuit of these arbitrage opportunities by market participants helps keep the yields in check and drives them toward convergence.\n\nFactors Preventing Perfect Convergence\n\nWhile the theory sounds neat, real markets are not that perfect. Several factors can prevent yields from perfectly converging:\n\nInformation Asymmetry: Not all market participants have access to the same information at the same time.\n\nGas fees: Moving assets between protocols or swapping one asset to another often involves fees, which can deter arbitrage.\n\nRegulatory Barriers: Different regulatory environments across regions can restrict the movement of assets or the participation of certain investors (lending, providing liquidity, and staking can be taxed differently, for example).\n\nRisk Differentials: Even if two stables may represent the same denomination, they might, by default, have different underlying risks. And strategies involving them might have other risks on top of that, leading to different yields.\n\nWith the theory being clear, let’s understand the events that have happened and have been happening that are shaping the DeFi stablecoin market the way it is today.\n\nMajor Events of Convergence\nChart 4 - 1 Year US bond treasury rate introduced on Chart 1. Data - DeFi Llama and US Dep. of Treasury.\n\nThe most important factor that permeates the changes happening in DeFi and this convergence event is the interest rate hikes performed by the FED in the US to control the high inflation. \n\nThis high-interest rate environment hinders economic activity, investment, and high-risk investment, among other factors, because it creates a high opportunity cost for doing anything else. There’s a high paying government bond with low risk, producing the same yield or even more than DeFi protocols.\n\nIt can be clearly seen on Chart 4 how the Lending and AMM markets were affected. But what gets our attention is how Maker DAO’s DSR was able to increase its TVL to such a significant level in such a short time, in the worst market circumstances.\n\nChart 5 - MakerDAO’s Balance Sheet  by asset type against the 1 Yr treasury bonds in the US. Data - Dune Analytics and US Dep. of Treasury.\n\nChart 5 gives us the biggest response to the underlying events we’re exploring: MakerDAO has been increasing its allocation on RWAs, which provide direct exposure to traditional finance and its current high-interest rates. This was a move by the DAO to get exposure to these high rates at a low risk with their vast stablecoin reserves, allocating more and more assets into RWAs to surf this high-interest rate environment. So much so that now it represents 52% of the entire balance sheet of the DAO.\n\nBecause of this allocation, currently, 66% of the revenue from the DAO comes from RWAs, and 30% comes from ETH liquid staking. This movement encapsulates the reaction of DeFi as a whole to the high-interest rates environment.\n\nMakerDAO’s high revenue coming from RWAs (directly influenced by the US bond rates), combined by its current dominance in the stablecoin money market is allowing MakerDAO to essentially act as the DeFi (De)Central Bank and to determine the base DeFi rate for money markets.\n\nThe significant revenue coming from ETH also gets a lot of our attention. Despite the interest rates going up, and consequently, DeFi TVL going down as a whole, staked ETH TVL was shooting up. Staking ETH became an alternative for those looking for a safe yield. ETH staking yield became blockchain’s de facto ‘risk-free’ rate.\n\nChart 6 - Lido’s TVL is increasing despite the increase of interest rates in the US. Data - Dune Analytics and US Dep. of Treasury.\n\nThese interesting events come at a price — ultimately, this convergence is the convergence of stable yields in DeFi, through RWAs, with rates in traditional finance. In this environment, where stable yield from DeFi money market solutions is not as eye-catching as TradFi yield, even fully on-chain stables like DAI became increasingly integrated with the risks of Traditional Finance.\n\nThis opens up a significant opportunity for crypto-native stable yield solutions that aligns more closely with the web3 market and less with traditional finance. The challenge lies in its ability to offer competitive yields against TradFi, even during economic downturns, and low volatility without necessarily mirroring its behavior.\n\nTime for On-chain native yields\n\nThere is evident demand for yields less correlated with the real-world economy, it just has to offer attractive returns even in the case of economic downturn. Web3 requires yield sources that are more closely aligned with its own dynamics and less susceptible to the disruptions, risks, and censorship prevalent in traditional finance.\n\nThis task isn't easy. Traditional finance, developed over centuries, is deeply rooted in path dependence. It has adapted to numerous regulations and incurred significant sunken costs, making it hard to move away from these established models to create something new. Yet, the beauty of building DeFi lies exactly in overcoming this challenge.\n\nBuilders have the golden opportunity to improve the current system, adapting it for a world of sovereign individuals. There's unlimited opportunity to build something new, leveraging the innate characteristics of this new world, free from the constraints of inefficient regulation and control.\n\nWe welcome innovation in new yield sources, fostering native financial cycles in DeFi. This involves capital flowing between convergence and divergence cycles with native and traditional yield sources on-chain, with the freedom of capital movement, aiming to create a unique environment of financial freedom, driving finance and freedom forward.\n\nConclusion\n\nOver the past year, the stablecoin market has faced significant changes, with a clear shift in TVL composition and a convergence of yields, spearheaded by the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) and its reliance on Real World Assets (RWAs). This trend has introduced a level of risk to the stablecoin market as yields became increasingly dependent on TradFi and its associated risks.\n\nAs stablecoin yields start to reflect traditional financial markets more closely, the line between DeFi and TradFi begins to blur. This shift may challenge the core principles of decentralization and autonomy that DeFi represents, as it becomes subject to the same economic pressures that affect the broader financial world.\n\nIn this context, the introduction of new web3 native sources of yield is necessary to create a more dynamic market where on-chain cycles are not solely dependent on the volatility of the market or traditional finance. The future of DeFi depends on different on-chain cycles that allow capital to move freely inside our own ecosystem and break away from the rusty shackles of control and traditional finance. \n\nYou can find more about Pedro on Twitter\n\nSources\n\nhttps://dune.com/queries/3145098/5245485\n\nDefiLlama\n\nDaily Treasury PAR Yield Curve Rates\n\nInvestment Disclosure.

This rise to popularity of the infrastructure around the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism really took off with its integration  at the protocol level on Ethereum during September 15, 2022—referred to as the “Merge”. The transition from the traditional Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism to PoS represented a paradigm shift in Ethereum consensus, allowing users to derisk the ability to provide (and price) Ethereum crypto-economic security. This enabled the growth of staking, the emergence of restaking, and the introduction of a new class of assets–liquid restaking tokens. \n\nUnderstanding Proof-of-Work and Its Limitations\n\nBefore delving into PoS, it's instructive to examine PoW, the pioneering consensus mechanism that continues to secure Bitcoin. At its core, consensus for blockchains refers to the underlying mechanism that enables transaction verification without relying on a centralized authority. Typically, consensus requires agreement from at least ⅔ of the network's nodes on its current state. This helps secure the network and confirm the updated history of transactions, also known as a state change.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nSubscribe\n\nUnder PoW, this consensus is achieved through mining. Miners utilize computational power to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The first to solve these equations verifies the next block, adding it to the blockchain, and in return, earns a reward. This process is resource-intensive, making it a race where participants must consume large amounts of energy for potential rewards. \n\nPoW also plays a pivotal role in transaction validation, preventing malicious actors from double-spending—a scenario where one user attempts to spend the same funds multiple times. However, achieving this in PoW requires maintaining control over 51% of the network, an expensive feat given the hardware and energy costs associated with this consensus mechanism. If an entity does achieve this, they could influence the consensus, posing a considerable risk to the network’s security. In such cases, the only solution to rectify the attack lies in a hard fork. Combating double-spending preserves blockchain's promise of immutability, decentralization, and trustworthiness.\n\nEmbracing Proof-of-Stake: A Shift towards Sustainability for Consensus\n\nPoS addresses the same core objective as PoW—validating and adding new blocks through consensus. It does so with greater efficiency and sustainability. Unlike PoW, which relies on energy-consuming computational tasks, PoS relies on validators who 'stake' an asset capital as collateral. To enter the validator set in the beacon chain and participate in validation activities, stakers must deposit a minimum of 32 ETH. Their staked amount acts as a deterrent against malicious activities, as any misdeed could result in a loss of their staked funds and forced exit from the beacon chain–a process known as slashing. The slashing penalty scales with the number of validators slashed within a given time period leading to greater losses for those validators who were slashed as a means to deter collusion between multiple validators at the same time.\n\nThe difference between PoW and PoS security mechanisms is substantial. While PoW deters malicious activity through resource expenditure (i.e. the cost of owning and operating a majority of nodes), PoS imposes direct financial penalties to stakers as a means to decrease the computational overhead of securing the chain.\n\nLiquid Staking: Innovating on Composability in the  PoS Landscape\n\nThe PoS realm had seen numerous innovations to additionally benefit stakers’ potential to earn yield. However, one glaring challenge remained, composability. Initially, stakers couldn't easily withdraw their stake, and there was little incentive to do so given the rewards. Liquid staking tokens (LSTs) emerged as the answer, enabling users to engage with DeFi without compromising on their exposure to staking yield. \n\nThroughout the past year, we’ve witnessed significant growth in LSTs, yet there remain challenges and potential new frontiers to further expand adoption of the vertical by the greater crypto ecosystem.. \n\nSlashing is the greatest risk which holders of LSTs are exposed to besides price depegging. As discussed before, slashing imposes a permanent penalty on  slashed validators, burning their ETH and exiting them from the beacon chain. This does not necessarily always impact the value of an LST token, however it does impact the amount of ETH redeemable by the token holder. As a result, correlated slashing events in which a significant amount of ETH is removed from the validator set of a liquid staking provider could incite skepticism on the solvency of the asset, leading to sell pressure on that LST and further inciting a depeg event.\n\nNumerous companies are striving to improve the liquid staking experience by offering innovations like reduced bond requirements, distributed validator technology (DVT), and trusted execution environments (TEEs), all with the aim of reducing the risks around slashing and making staking safer. It will become increasingly important to utilize such tools within the validator infrastructure of liquid staking providers as more use cases for LSTs in the DeFi ecosystem make solvency for LSTs even more important.. \n\nConcurrently, there's a rush to satisfy the appetite for diverse yield opportunities, be it through DeFi, incentive mechanisms, or innovative products. One such paradigm that has risen to the main stage is restaking. Restaking is specifically designed to reflect the ETH PoS crypto economic design and iterate on it to reduce the barriers of bootstrapping PoS systems while allowing stakers to earn additional revenue on their assets.\n\nRestaking and the Advent of Actively Validated Services\nExtending Ethereum’s POS Security\n\nEthereum’s PoS consensus mechanism offers a unique advantage: it's programmable and scalable security via cryptoeconomic value. This security, intrinsic to Ethereum, extends seamlessly to all of the protocols that are secured by the underlying continuity of the beacon chain as a byproduct. This is a diverse array of smart contract protocols, ranging from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to NFT marketplaces. However, until recently, this robust security framework didn't wasn’t able to innately extend itself to other applications or distributed systems such as bridges, sequencers, data availability layers, or other blockchains that required some other form of consensus. Systems like these have traditionally been tasked with bootstrapping their own consensus mechanisms to safeguard their operations, a challenge exemplified by platforms like Axelar and its native PoS network. \n\nRestaking: Bridging the Security Gap\n\nAddressing this gap in extendability of security provisioning led to the inception of restaking—a pioneering concept that allows staked assets on Ethereum to bolster the security of arbitrary distributed systems. EigenLayer, the first restaking protocol, coined the term \"Programmable Trust\" to describe this mechanism. More intriguingly, the distributed systems benefiting from this trust mechanism are termed Actively Validated Services (AVSs).\n\nEigenLayer: Amplifying Commitments and Security\n\nAt its core, EigenLayer operates as an amalgamation of smart contracts and off-chain software, amplifying the commitments a validator or other external node operator can undertake. This enhancement enables validators to engage with AVSs, requiring them to run supplementary software. \n\nConcurrently, the EigenLayer smart contracts introduce new slashing conditions on the restaked Ethereum, predicated on the specifications of the chosen AVS. In exchange, these restakers are able to earn rewards for providing security to these systems. These conditions are agnostic to whether Ethereum is staked directly or via LSTs from an affiliated liquid staking provider. This makes it easier for distributed systems to build a security model without having to worry about bootstrapping security providers–stakers. Restakers can opt-in to multiple AVSs, exposing their stake to multiple slashing conditions and earning rewards from multiple AVSs. Ultimately, EigenLayer pools security through restaking instead of fragmenting it. Pooling security is what enables multiple parties to combine their resources to provide greater security for the entire restaking ecosystem.\n\nUnveiling EigenLayer’s Potential: AVSs and New Yield Opportunities\n\nThe emergence of AVSs that can harness programmable trust heralds a transformative phase for distributed systems. Not only do they offer unprecedented access to inherited security, but they also unlock a myriad of additional yield opportunities for stakers. By providing security to these services, stakers can tap into innovative avenues for rewards while maintaining alignment with Ethereum’s long term goals and supporting the services they desire.\n\nPotential Limitations of Restaking\nIntroduction to Potential Limitations\n\nWhile restaking brings an enticing opportunity for stakers to amplify their returns, it's not devoid of challenges. The added slashing conditions introduced by platforms like EigenLayer lead to augmented rewards for stakers, compensating for the heightened risk. Yet, the architectural constraints of EigenLayer hint at potential composability issues with restaking positions, notably due to the intricate risk profiles that arise. This complexity mirrors the challenges that PoS grappled with during its early stages.\n\nFuture Scenarios for Restaking in DeFi\n\nBroadly, there are two potential trajectories for the integration of restaking positions into the DeFi landscape:\n\nScenario 1: Governance-Gated Risk Management\n\nLiquid staking providers might decide to mitigate some of the inherent risks of restaking strategies by implementing governance-based selections. Here, the strategies deemed appropriate for their users' risk tolerance are permitted. Consequently, this could lead providers to segment their offerings, targeting specific risk demographics. For instance, a platform like Lido, aspiring to be perceived as a 'safety-first' provider, may renounce users with a higher risk appetite, as they'll be more inclined to seek providers promising greater yields through aggressive restaking strategies.\n\nScenario 2: Non-Fungibility and the Push to LST Users\n\nShould situations arise where dominant platforms like EigenLayer experience significant slashing events or there's a widespread erosion of trust in providers, it may become infeasible for liquid staking providers to endorse restaking at the node operator level. Instead, the decision-making may shift to LST users. Here, EigenLayer restaking positions could become the predominant staked asset representation. However, due to their distinctive risk profiles, these assets are inherently non-fungible. This poses challenges in assimilating them into the broader DeFi ecosystem since most protocols are parameterized based on price-based dependencies. Restaking positions would find trouble here due to their intrinsic scarcity of liquidity and limited price discovery.\n\nThe Conundrum of Staked Asset Financialization\n\nWhile EigenLayer and similar platforms seek to fortify PoS networks through innovative staking models, the escalating complexities in validator risk profiles inadvertently spawn secondary challenges. Both aforementioned scenarios hint at a landscape where staked and restaked assets become fragmented and illiquid. This dynamic severely hampers the feasibility of leveraging restaking positions within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nLiquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) Explored\nDefinition and Overview\n\nLiquid Restaking Tokens, or LRTs, are the derivative representations of restaking positions. Analogous to LSTs, LRTs have emerged to grant broader and more intuitive access to restaking positions. Numerous protocols are championing this initiative, though the frontrunner is yet to emerge. Before delving into these protocols and distinguishing their attributes, it's essential to appraise the pros and cons of LRTs.\n\nThe Differences Between a Liquid Staking Provider and LRT Provider\n\nLiquid staking providers and LRT providers have similar end goals, which is to provide stakers or restakers respectively with a liquid representation of their underlying position. However, they reach this end by different means. The liquid staking provider is solely focused on providing depositors with a means of connecting with a reliable node operator so that they can spin up validators and provide receipt tokens for staking positions. They help match capital to hardware operators. On the other hand, LRT providers must also account for the risk profile of AVSs which they opt-in to and further expose their LRT holders to.  Liquid restaking helps manage capital delegation between yield opportunities as a form of portfolio management. Their goal is to return the user upside while minimizing risk exposure. Identifying an appropriate risk to reward framework which characterizes the LRT is one of the primary objectives of an LRT’s governance mechanism, whereas the governance mechanism for liquid staking providers is less objective. \n\nAdvantages of LRTs\n\nLRTs facilitate more seamless integrations between restaking and DeFi. This aligns closely with the first potential future for restaked assets we previously discussed. That is, LST providers create liquid representations of restaking positions and manage them through governance-gating. This could enable LST providers to create well-defined risk profiles, enabling users to properly manage their portfolio of restaked assets and relish enhanced versatility. This approach enables restakers to participate in DeFi while still gaining the benefits of restaking.\n\nConsiderations for Users\n\nWhile the benefits of LRTs are apparent, potential users should remain cognizant of their constraints. As described in the first scenario, many upcoming LRTs incorporate some form of governance oversight. This can restrict the flexibility of LRT holders to express their risk appetite and support their desired AVSs. This governance model raises pertinent questions about the motivations underpinning LRT providers' endorsements of specific AVSs and their ability to create a well justified risk to reward model. A transparent exploration of these motives in governance forums will be crucial for maintaining trust and transparency.\n\nChallenges in Underwriting LRTs\n\nThe task of underwriting LRTs presents its own set of complexities. It might be equally, if not more, challenging than underwriting LSTs, given the nuanced risk profiles and unique pricing dynamics of LRTs. Addressing these challenges mandates protocols to adopt a more asset-specific approach towards creating markets for which LRTs can be sustainably supported. A deep understanding of the underlying mechanics of Ethereum core infrastructure, PoS, AVS design, and LRT design will be crucial. We’ll elucidate more on the design considerations for LRTs in detail in the subsequent sections.\n\nLRT Case Studies\n\nNow that we covered Eigenlayer, AVSs and the role of restaking, let's look at some case studies of early projects building in the ecosystem. As of now there are over 10 LRT projects building at the liquid restaking layer. \n\nWe dive deeper into the following projects:\n\nKelpDAO (rsETH)\n\nRenzo (ezETH)\n\nEtherFi (eETH)\n\nRestakeFi (rstETH)\n\nPuffer (pufETH)\n\nKelpDAO/ Stader (rsETH)\n\nrsETH as a Part of Liquid Restaking\n\nFundamentally, an LRT, or Liquid Re-Staking Token, serves as a liquid representation of restaking positions to allow restakers on EigenLayer access to a form of their position that they can use in the greater DeFi ecosystem. RsETH is an LRT issued by KelpDAO aimed at addressing the risks and challengesposed by the current limitations of restaking position liquidity.\n\nRestakers in Kelp engage by staking their LST to generate rsETH tokens, signifying partial ownership of a pool of the underlying restaked assets. Then, two rsETH contracts allocate the deposited tokens among different Node Operators collaborating with the Kelp DAO. Rewards accumulate from a diverse array of AVSs that were delegated to by the rsETH contracts. The value of the rsETH token reflects the underlying value of the various reward and staked tokens.\n\nRestakers have the option to exchange their rsETH tokens for other tokens on AMMs for immediate liquidity or opt to redeem underlying assets through rsETH contracts. Restakers can further leverage their rsETH tokens in DeFi.\n\nIsolated Architecture\n\nThe rsETH smart contracts are structured to segregate deposits, delegations, and withdrawals, ensuring a distinct division of responsibilities and minimizing the overall risk exposure to users of the protocol.\n\nThe overall structure includes 4 main modules: depositing and minting anLRT, moving assets to delegators, moving assets to strategies, and withdrawing. Depositing and minting rsETH automates the process of delegating to AVSs, saving the effort in identifying the right services and validators, and helping manage staking rewards.\n\nMoving assets to delegators and strategies include transferring the tokens to Node Delegation Contracts (NDCs) based on tokenomics, weights, and distribution metrics. Strategies include delegating the funds from Node Delegator Contracts to Strategy Manager which distributes the funds among different strategies.\n\nUpon a successful undelegation, the assets transition to NDCs, subsequently handed over to the Withdrawal Manager smart contract. The withdrawal manager determines the amount of assets to be allocated to the restaker based on the latest exchange rate. Once the funds are effectively withdrawn, rsETH is minted.\n\nThere are also 4 other modules supporting the Kelp DAO: registry (records operators, services, and assets in the rsETH ecosystem, including associated metadata and essential properties of rsETH), oracle (updates real-time asset prices for rsETH contracts, facilitating accurate minting and burning of rsETH based on deposit and redemption needs), governance (set of contracts that translate successful proposals into executable code to change smart contract behavior), and reward market (module optimizes non-ETH rewards through diverse extra-yield strategies, becoming a foundational layer for assessing and optimizing governance and utility tokens amidst the AVS surge). \n\nKelp x Stader\n\nAmitej G and Dheeraj B, founders of Stader Labs, a multichain liquid staking platform with $230M+ in TVL, established Kelp DAO. The team is dedicated to developing Liquid Restaking Solutions for public blockchain networks.\n\nStader boasts more than 85,000 users and over $25 million in paid rewards, along with over 40 DeFi integrations. They have also forged partnerships with industry leaders such as Pantera Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Blockchain.com, Jump Capital, and other prominent funds in the space. Additionally, they have collaborated with renowned figures in the crypto world, including Sandeep Nailwal and Jaynti Kanani (Polygon’s co-founders), Nemil Dalal (Head of Crypto at Coinbase), Tim Ogilvie (Staked’s co-founder), and others.\n\nAmitej and Dheeraj have successfully created one of the most robust liquid staking platforms across different chains, attracting significant capital and establishing partnerships with industry leaders. Their current commitment is to develop an LRT solution on EigenLayer for Ethereum.\n\nThe team has been diligently working on the design since Q1 2023 and was the first to publish the LRT intentions, coining the term LRT. Furthermore, the Kelp DAO has already undergone audits by some of the most trusted auditors in web3, including Sigma Prime and Code4arena, where no critical issues were found.\n\nEtherFi (eETH)\n\nEtherFi (eETH) is a decentralized, non-custodial Ethereum staking protocol that has evolved significantly since its inception. Initially, EtherFi focused on enabling a scalable network of solo stakers using Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). This technology divides validator keys, allowing a broader range of users to stake permissionlessly, addressing the requirement of having 32 ETH for staking and minimizing the centralization of slashing risk away from a single hardware operator.\n\nIn a more recent development, EtherFi has expanded into staking and liquid restaking verticals with their eETH LST/LRT hybrid. Here, users can mint eETH by staking ETH, which not only generates native ETH staking yield but is also natively restaked on Eigenlayer, thus enabling holders to receive double the staking rewards they earn from vanilla staking. This system differentiates itself from stETH (Lido) by eliminating the need for an additional restaking action on Eigenlayer, simplifying the process for users. Additionally, users will be able to further utilize their eETH in DeFi to earn additional yield if they wish to do so. \n\nMechanism Design\n\nAt the core of EtherFi's mechanism, ETH validators point their withdrawal addresses to Eigenpods. This setup allows users to earn Eigen points, which are expected to convert into protocol rewards later.\n\nIn the current landscape of EtherFi's staking mechanisms, it's crucial to understand that without Actively Validated Services (AVS) being live, a Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) effectively operates in a manner akin to a Liquid Staking Token (LST). However, with the future activation of AVSs, it is expected that LRTs will yield relatively higher rewards, though they may also bring increased risks from additional slashing conditions.\n\nRenzo (ezETH)\n\nRenzo (ezETH) is an LRT platform and Strategy Manager for Eigenlayer. It is built to serve as an interface for Eigenlayer, abstracting away many of the technical, financial, and risk management barriers for market participants and enabling easier access to the emerging restaking primitive. The same way Eigenlayer enables any distributed system to inherit Ethereum’s security, Renzo enables any on-chain user to help secure the networks being built on top of this new primitive–AVSs. Renzo helps bridge the gap between the AVSs which need security, and users who are attempting to balance the risks and rewards of restaking.\n\nMechanism Design\n\nUsers can deposit either ETH or any supported LST (stETH, rETH, cbETH) on Renzo to mint an equivalent amount in ezETH. For every 1 ETH/LST deposited, 1 ezETH is minted.\n\nFormally the value flow runs from ETH Staking → Eigenlayer AVSs → Renzo Restaking. By securing Eigenlayer AVSs, Renzo offers a higher yield than vanilla staking and is thus expected to drive more volume and participation to ETH staking as a whole.\n\nezETH is a yield-bearing asset which works similar to Compounds cTokens, where the value of ezETH reflects the restaking rewards earned on the underlying position; generally the price of ezETH increases relative to its underlying LSTs as the position accumulates rewards earned in AVS tokens. Rewards are distributed in ETH, USDC, and AVS tokens.\n\nThe core function of Renzo is to help secure Eigenlayer AVSs, and the protocol offers restaking strategies where users can decide to secure one or more networks to earn yield. As each AVS represents a unique entry for rewards (as well as risk), the restaking ecosystem will supposedly benefit from a greater number of AVSs, as this brings in more diverse strategies for restakers. \n\nThis opens up the doors for new opportunities for protocols and services to be built and implemented; ecosystem-native LRTs which secure a specific AVS and offer holders unique opportunities such as priority execution and fee rebates, financial primitives such as risk/reward management strategies for LRT holders, dual-staking marketplaces, and more. Furthermore, upon launch, any team will be able to permissionlessly build the restaking infrastructure end-to-end to benefit from the restaking ecosystem while controlling the entire flow with or without a token, enabling teams to custom-build infrastructure to meet their specific preferences in a flexible manner.\n\nRestakeFi\n\nRestake Finance refers to itself as 'the first modular liquid staking protocol for EigenLayer. A user will be able to deposit their ETH or stETH in EigenLayer via smart contracts governed by the Restake Finance DAO. In turn, depositors will receive rstETH, which incorporates a rebasing and yield-bearing mechanism. Re-basing will occur on a daily basis, resulting in an increase in rstETH in your wallet. Please note that this does not include the yield earned from EigenLayer; that requires a separate claiming mechanism.\n\nThe unique mechanism behind Restake is that depositors will eventually be able to choose the modules they want to validate. A user has the option to validate as many (or as few) pods as they prefer. A risk-averse user will likely opt for a single pod with an established team and track record, while a user with a higher risk appetite may seek more yield and, consequently, choose to validate more pods.\n\nPuffer (pufETH)\n\nPuffer Finance aims to stimulate validator decentralization through a network of homestake nodes by reducing the initial amount from 32 ETH to 2 ETH. This is made possible by a novel remote signing tool known as ‘Secure-Signer,’ which aims to prevent slashing risks while utilizing Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX. The Secure-Signer tool manages validator keys on behalf of the consensus client and can be run locally or remotely. When running within a TEE, it secures the validator keys using applied encryption when the keys are at rest, ensuring they cannot be used otherwise.\n\nSource: Puffer docs\n\nIn addition to the TEE, validators also benefit from having their keys secured within it. Puffer is unique in that it can support Application-Specific Validators (ASVs) that require some form of privacy, such as privacy-preserving Layer 2s.\n\nTo actively participate in the validation set of a designated ASV, a staker (referred to as a Puffer) can deposit any amount over 0.01 ETH, which is added to a pool of ETH. This pool serves as a reserve that can be tapped into to form a new node for validators. This ETH will be staked if the requirements (32 ETH per node) are fulfilled, and in return, a Puffer will receive pufETH, a yield-bearing token similar to Compound’s cToken structure, which increases in value over time due to the accrual of rewards.\n\nTo redeem their underlying ETH, Puffers can burn their pufETH, receiving the original ETH and accrued rewards if there is sufficient liquidity in the withdrawal pool. To facilitate this, a portion of all deposited ETH into Puffer Finance, as well as rewards and node withdrawals, is added to the withdrawal pool to provide exit liquidity.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this piece, we’ve explored the evolution of Ethereum’s consensus mechanisms (both past and present), focusing on the transition from PoW to PoS, and the innovative development of LSTs and LRTs. Ethereum’s Merge introduced PoS to the network, which marked a significant shift towards more sustainable and scalable blockchain security. LSTs emerged as the solution to the liquidity challenges stakers originally faced, allowing users to participate in DeFi while staking. The LRT further builds upon this, offering enhanced yield opportunities and security contributions for users participating in Eigenlayer’s restaking ecosystem. \n\nThe benefits of LRTs are not without their risks. This research covered the most pertinent risks to LRT holders such as composability, the potential for slashing, and the complexities that arise in the management of restaking positions and their risk profiles (i.e. what AVSs they opt-in to and why). We also highlight the innovations in the space, including projects like EigenLayer – the pioneers of restaking – and platforms like KelpDAO and Puffer Finance that aim to democratize access to restaking via their LRT solutions. \n\nOverall, the piece provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state and potential future of Ethereum's consensus mechanisms, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges in this rapidly evolving landscape. The integration of restaking into Ethereum's ecosystem represents a significant milestone, offering a more sustainable and scalable approach to blockchain security and opening up new avenues for yield generation in the DeFi space.\n\nSources\n\nStake with Ether.fi\n\nby Kelp DAO\n\nEigenLayer\n\nEigenLayer Docs\n\nInvestment Disclosure.

It’s well known for possessing an intent-based architecture, a narrative that has caught the attention of many with its user-friendly interface. However, under the hood, CoW Swap has a lot more than meets the eye. The CoW Swap team has been building non-stop, delivering prominent features, including (a) MEV Blocker (b) Limit Orders (c) Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) (d) CoW Hooks (e) Milkman ERC1271 orders and (f) Programmatic Orders.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

We then end with an overview of the current protocol developments and what to expect from the protocol in the future.\n\nWhat are AMMs?\n\nTo uncover the innovation driven by CoW Swap, one must understand automated market makers (AMM), a type of decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to trade one asset for another. AMMs use liquidity pools to match traders with liquidity for their trades, rather than a peer to peer approach typically used in traditional finance. For example, a user that wishes to swap ETH for USDC can do so in a ETH/USDC liquidity pool. Upon the swap, the ratio of ETH to USDC changes, to which the AMM will re-price the ETH remaining in the pool. To understand more about AMMs, you can refer to this link here.\n\nAMMs typically require traders to submit a transaction from their wallet to be able to interact with the liquidity pools for swapping. As a result of this necessary interaction with the pools, AMMs settle trades in a sequential manner, based on the change in liquidity upon each swap. CoW Swap employs an intent based design which innovates on the traditional AMM design, connecting traders directly (when possible) with each other without using pools. Benefits of this innovation include lower fees and better execution prices, which will be explained in the later part. To understand the core innovations one must understand what intents are to begin with. \n\nWhat are Intents?\n\nIntents refer to the desired goal of a user, for example ‘I wish to swap USDC for ETH’. An intent-based protocol facilitates on-chain activities by abstracting the complex processes associated with it. A user can declare the end goal they wish to achieve ‘I wish to receive ETH’, and specify certain parameters ‘I wish to receive ETH by swapping USDC’. This message can then be signed to authorize sophisticated third-parties known as solvers to execute the intent, eventually delivering ETH to the user. \n\nHere’s a visualization of an intent-based system:\n\nIntents help make the process of achieving on-chain goals easier and less technical. Instead of going through a complex process to complete a transaction, a person can set their goal and some rules, and let others handle the technical details to make it happen. In practice a user can define the terms, and sign a message that other parties fulfill. This makes completing transactions on-chain simpler and more user-friendly, especially when multiple goals can be grouped together in one go, saving time and resources.\n\nTo learn more about intents, you can refer to this article here.\n\nIntroduction to CoW Swap\n\nCoW Swap emerges as a premier example of intent-based applications, where users indicate their desired trade outcome, delegating the execution to third-party, permissionless agents called solvers. The core mechanism utilized by CoW Swap is known as batch auctions, which aggregates users’ intent (the orders they wish to carry out). Solvers compete to offer the most optimal execution route for these orders, which will maximize the user surplus (the amount of asset received by user after swap). The execution methods used by solvers can be a combination of both off-chain matching and on-chain swaps. Solvers are rewarded upon successful execution of orders within the batch auction.\n\nThe key difference between CoW Swap and other AMMs is the utilization of Coincidence of Wants (CoW), where overlapping user intents can be matched without being routed through a pool. This offers higher gas efficiencies and lower cost for users. In addition, given that user orders are not being routed through a public mempool, CoW Swap mitigates Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) problems, further contributing to a more optimized swap for users.\n\nCoW Swap Transaction Execution Mechanism\nBatch Auctions\n\nCoW Swap’s batch auction mechanism aggregates orders and settles them together at once, in comparison to the traditional sequential execution of orders. Batch auction serves as the core pricing (price discovery) mechanism for CoW Swap. Orders are grouped together, where solvers (off-chain counterparties) compete to execute these orders either through off-chain matching or on-chain DEXs.\n\nSolvers utilize advanced computations to customize trading routes for all orders in the batch auction, based on the user inputs (e.g. price, slippage tolerance etc.). Orders that fulfill Coincidence of Wants can be executed off-chain, while the remaining orders can be routed to other AMMs or DEX aggregators for execution. Thereafter, the settlement logic is passed on to protocols for execution, who are responsible in validating the execution legitimacy (approval of transaction etc.).\n\nLet’s visualize the workflow of a batch auction:\n\nA group of 4 users on CoW Swap submitted their orders off-chain via intents \n\nThese orders are aggregated into a batch and forwarded to the solver network\n\nSolvers compete to provide the most optimal execution: \n\nThey will use their respective algorithm to identify the best execution route possible\n\nCoincidence of Wants: Where orders match, the trade will be executed off-chain directly between the traders\n\nRemaining orders that did not managed to be matched will be settled on AMMs / DEX aggregators\n\nSolvers submit their settlement solutions to the protocol who then ranks them based on surplus maximization and proceeds to push on-chain the winning settlement\n\nThe main motivation of utilizing a solver network is to maximize the amount of assets that users can receive. This is achieved through the competition amongst solvers to source for the most optimal trading route with their fulfillment algorithm.\n\nSolvers\n\nEssentially, solvers compete to provide the best batch auction settlement by first identifying Coincidence of Wants within the batch. Thereafter, solvers will take note of any remaining trades that did not manage to be settled, and search through AMMs or DEX aggregators to settle them with the lowest slippage.\n\nA detailed look into the workflow of solvers:\n\nAt the start of a batch, all off-chain orders are considered for inclusion\n\nSelected off-chain orders will be aggregated into a batch auction by the protocol. \n\nNote: After a batch closes, no new orders will be included\n\nSolvers receive the orders in a batch and proceed to optimize the order with the goal of having their respective order settlement solution pushed on-chain\n\nThe solution that offers the best clearing price, maxizming traders’ returns, will be selected\n\nWinning solver will receive rewards in the form of COW tokens which are granted by the protocol to incentive solver competition\n\nAt the moment, the entirety of the fee charged to users is used to cover ethereum gas fees. That said, it's been proposed on the CoW DAO forum, that the protocol may experiment with different fee models\n\nAt this current stage of the protocol, CoW Swap utilizes an allow-list authentication contract to determine the addresses that qualify as solvers. In addition, an address can qualify as a solver if they provide a bond stated on CoW DAO CIP7 (CoW Improvement Proposal). Upon discovery of malicious behaviour (deliberately not providing users with the best execution route etc.), the bond will be slashed. Thus, this bond is meant to ensure that solvers are aligned with both CoW Swap and users. Nonetheless, most solvers do not have such a hefty amount of upfront capital. In these scenarios, solvers can be vouched by any existing bonding pool owner.\n\nThe competitive landscape of CoW Swap's solver network is rapidly evolving. Initially, DEX aggregators like 1inch and 0x dominated, settling over 50% of transactions. However, their market share has declined, now accounting for less than 4% of transactions. In contrast, advanced solvers such as Barter and Otex have risen to prominence, now handling the majority of solver volume.\n\nSophisticated solvers can source liquidity from intricate places, which are generally not accessible by DEX aggregators. This might’ve caused existing DEX aggregators’ market share to decline, tipping the scale in favor of independent solvers.\n\nNow that we have understood the general concept of batch auctions and the role of solvers, let’s take a deeper look into Coincidence of Wants and how they play a critical role in CoW Swap.\n\nCoincidence of Wants (CoWs)\n\nFor traditional finance incumbents and even non-crypto natives, it might be eye opening to see a protocol named “CoW” Swap, transacting hundreds of millions of dollars of digital asset volume. CoW refers to Coincidence of Wants, which is an economic phenomenon where two parties each hold an item the other wants, allowing them to carry out a direct exchange.\n\n    To understand this better, let’s take the example of Alice and Bob:\n\nAlice wants to swap 1000 USDC to ETH\n\nBob wants to swap ETH into 1000 USDC\n\nIn the above scenario, it is clear that CoW exists. This allows for trades to be settled directly between Alice and Bob, without the need for external market makers or liquidity providers (LPs) to provide the liquidity for trade execution.\n\nCoincidence of Wants can vary in their complexity, these figures are a good depiction of simple, batch and intermediate Coincidence of Wants.\n\nRing Trade\n\nWhat happens when there are more than 2 orders involved in a batch, and there isn’t an exact Coincidence of Wants to allow for these orders to be settled directly amongst each other?\n\nInstead of having to wait for an exact match between 2 parties, ring trades allow for liquidity to be shared amongst various parties as shown in the figure below.\n\nFrom the figure above, it's clear that participants don't need to have exactly what the other party wants to complete a trade. They can leverage the broader network of participants in the batch auction to acquire the desired asset. On the contrary, execution of these 4 orders on traditional DEXs will take place in a sequential manner, exposing all participants to potential price slippages and MEV. We'll delve deeper into the concept of MEV later in the article.\n\nIt is important to note that every ring trade is considered as a Coincidence of Wants, but not every Coincidence of Wants is a ring trade.\n\nCoW Swap Features\n\nNow that we have understood CoW Swap’s core architecture, we can dive into the unique features made possible.\n\nCoW Hooks\n\nCoW Swap utilizes ‘hooks’, which are custom code attached to an order that can be executed before and/or after a trade. Hooks are useful because they can save users time and gas by turning multiple transactions or intents into a single intent.\n\nThis is the crux of CoW Swap’s intent-based architecture. CoW hooks make it possible for users to string together a series of complex actions, which may include bridging, staking, swapping, provision of liquidity and many more, and execute this series in a single transaction.\n\nCoW Hook Architecture\n\nPre-hooks\n\nPre-hooks are intents that can be encoded into an order, and will be executed prior to a swap on CoW Swap.\n\nThese actions are executed prior to an order’s signature being checked or tokens being sent from the user's address to CoW Swap.\n\nPost-hooks\n\nPost-hooks on the other hand, are actions that are executed after the swap has completed, where the swapped tokens have been transferred to the user's address.\n\nLet’s take a look at a specific example, where a user stakes on Lido, after closing a loan position on Aave.\n\nPre-hook: Close an open position on Aave by repaying the loan collateralized by USDC\n\nSwap: USDC will be converted to ETH through CoW Swap\n\nPost-hook: Stake ETH through Lido\n\nFees associated with hook execution are charged in the sell token of the swap, and cover 100% the execution costs. For example, when closing an open position on Aave, any additional fees will be paid in USDC. There is no need for users to hold onto additional ETH for the orders to be successful. This is beneficial as the process becomes more seamless, and prevents users from being unable to execute transactions due to lack of gas tokens.\n\nCoW Hooks Use Cases\n\nSome of the potential use cases made possible by CoW hooks include\n\nRepaying a debt → Staking\n\nAs mentioned in the above example for pre-hooks and post-hooks\n\nNFT sniping → Selling the NFT → Swapping tokens\n\nUpon selling a sniped NFT, the amount received can be immediately swapped into the desired token. This reduces the asset volatility experienced by users\n\nClaiming airdrops\n\nSell airdrop tokens, while using airdrop tokens as gas\n\nAutomated LP position management\n\na. Collect LP rewards\n\nb. Convert LP rewards into 50/50 of each asset in the LP pair\n\nc. Deposit both assets back into the liquidity pool to increase LP position\n\nThe image above shows that CoW hooks aren't just for DeFi activities, rather, they have a broad range of use cases. Various users, including NFT snipers and airdrop farmers, can also benefit from hooks. Over time, CoW hooks will likely introduce more nuanced and sophisticated use cases, catering to a wider range of users.\n\nTime-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) Orders\n\nWhat is TWAP?\n\nTime-weighted average price (TWAP) is one of the most common algorithmic strategies used for executing trades. It is typically utilized when traders have a large order size and wish to reduce the impact on the market, as well as the slippage they suffer from it. For example, if a trader buys $1 million worth of $COW all at once, the price impact can be significantly high on AMMs due to the lack of liquidity. To prevent the price impact, a TWAP order would split the large order into smaller orders, which are executed over regular intervals, for a set period of time. Put simply, traders using TWAPs orders spread trades over time based on the average price in the TWAP calculation. \n\nMechanism of TWAP Orders [In Beta]\n\nWith CoW Swap, users can make a TWAP order by simply specifying the following metrics\n\nAsset of choice (e.g. USDC/ETH)\n\nUsers choose the asset they wish to swap out of and the asset they wish to swap into\n\nTotal order size\n\nTotal amount to be swapped\n\nNumber of parts\n\nThis is the number of times the order will be split into\n\nDuration\n\nThis refers to the length of time over which the order will be executed\n\nThe amount to be executed per swap can be calculated by total order size / Number of parts. And the intervals at which the swaps will be executed can be calculated by Duration / Number of parts.\n\nCoW Swap’s TWAP Order Interface\n\nIn addition, users will also be able to specify the price protection. The TWAP order placed will not execute should the price of the asset drop beyond the percentage set for price protection. This is meant to protect the user’s capital and prevent them from buying into a potential black swan event (e.g. cascading liquidation) that could result in them entering a position with disadvantageous prices.\n\nBenefits of TWAP Orders\n\nThere are multiple benefits that users can gain through TWAP orders:\n\nReduced Price Impact\n\nUsers typically have to pay a higher price when executing large orders on automated market makers (AMMs). This is due to the price impact of the order, where the inflow of large volume causes the price within the liquidity pool to spike up. In addition, big orders are also prone to sandwich attacks by MEV bots, essentially inflating the purchase price for users.\n\nWith TWAP, the orders made each time are of smaller sizes. As apparent from the above figure shown for TWAP’s mechanism, instead of executing a $1000 order, it is split into 5 x $200 orders. This effectively reduces the price impact that users suffer, allowing them to swap at a fairer price.\n\nReduced Slippage\n\nWith bigger orders, users generally have to account for a higher slippage for the order to be filled. This is due to the price impact it brings to the market, which requires the slippage to account for the difference.\n\nWith smaller orders, users can set a lower slippage. This allows them to execute the order at a price point closer to what they desire. In addition, it also helps them to reduce the amount lost to slippage, in turn receiving more of the desired assets.\n\nIncreased Flexibility\n\nUsers are able to customize the various metrics to decide how much they want to execute over each interval. In addition, since the order is submitted off-chain, users will be able to make changes to their TWAP orders based on market conditions, without incurring additional fees.\n\nCoW Swap’s Unique Benefits\nMEV-Resistance\n\nMaximal extractable value (MEV) refers to the profit that validators can earn through arbitrage, which includes inclusion, exclusion and re-ordering of transaction sequence while building a block.\n\nOften, MEV is seen as a negative externality as they result in users suffering from unfavorable prices or failed transactions. Broadly speaking, there are 3 types of MEV: (a) Front-running (b) Back-running (c) Sandwich Attacks:\n\nFrontrunning: Attacker places a transaction before a targeted user’s transaction to benefit from the upcoming transaction.\n\nBackrunning: Attacker places a transaction after a trade to benefit from the already placed transaction.\n\nSandwich Attack: Attacker places a transaction before and after a user's transaction to manipulate the asset price, thus profiting from arbitrage. \n\nTo understand more about MEV and examples, you can check out this article here.\n\nWith CoW Swap, there are 2 main mechanisms that minimizes the level of MEV users are exposed to:\n\nCoincidence of Wants: No Exposure to Transaction Order Manipulation\n\nTraditionally when trading on a DEX, users will submit their orders, which will be sent to a public mempool, which is where transactions sit before being confirmed by validators. This public mempool is heavily monitored by bots looking to profi from arbitrages. On CoW Swap, user orders are submitted and matched off-chain through solvers. Hence, the orders are not routed through a public mempool, preventing any other users from potentially front-running the order.\n\nHere’s an example of MEV that could occur in a typical DEX. Claire wishes to make a swap 10,000 USDC into ETH, a user that is monitoring the mempool will attempt to insert their own transaction (swap 10,000 USDC for ETH) before Claire. This increase in ETH demand will cause the ETH price to increase. When it’s time for Claire’s swap to execute, she will be faced with a higher ETH price, resulting in her receiving less ETH than what she originally had.\n\nBatch Auction: Uniform Clearing Price (UCP)\n\nTypically, orders on a DEX are executed in a sequential manner. This creates the opportunity for MEV as builders can re-order the transaction ordering to generate profits. However, this change in execution order results in users receiving different prices for their trades. For example, an order executed later might have to pay a higher price, causing the user to receive less assets than what would have been the original case.\n\nWith CoW Swap’s batch auction, a mean settlement price will be calculated for all orders within a batch. Hence, there will be no MEV available for extraction since reordering of orders will be pointless.\n\nYou can learn more details about the different types of MEV here.\n\nGasless Transactions and Low Fees\n\nOne other key value proposition is the fee optimization made available to users, which comes from various aspects:\n\nOff-Chain Signing\n\nSince the orders are submitted off-chain, there is no need for the users to pay gas with the chain native token. In addition, it is impossible for users to be faced with failed transactions, preventing them from paying unnecessary gas.\n\nIn addition, since the orders are submitted off-chain, users are free to make as many orders as they wish, and are also able to cancel the orders as and when they want.\n\nCoincidence of Wants Transactions\n\nThrough direct matching of transactions, there are no additional fees charged to the users, which would have been the case should users have traded on other DEXs such as Uniswap.\n\nCoW Swap’s Future Outlook\n\nCoW Swap has laid down plans to further decentralize the protocol in the future. One aspect in which they do so is through a permissionless solver model which encompasses 2 main components:\n\nLogic for solvers to be deemed suitable will be encoded into the smart contract\n\nStaking of assets by solvers to disincentivize malicious behavior\n\nWIth a permissionless model, we can anticipate CoW Swap’s solver network to become highly robust. This eventually translates to better settlement for users, as the competition amongst solvers will strive to bring the best terms to users.\n\nConclusion\n\nCoW Swap was one of the pioneers in experimenting on intent-based architecture and bringing it to the masses back in 2021. Since then, more projects have embarked on this field to optimize the various aspects. Anoma, is working on integrating intents into a chain. Propeller Heads, is working on fine-tuning the solver elements and searching for ways to make it more robust. With such a level of interest and research by the broader industry, it is certainly exciting to see how CoW Swap will continue to develop.\n\nSources\n\nIntroduction - CoW Protocol\n\nCoW Swap Dune Dashboard\n\nCoW Hooks\n\nAn Introduction to Intents and Intent-centric Architectures | Blog - Anoma\n\nIntent-Based Architectures and Their Risks\n\nHow CoWs Will Save DeFi Swaps\n\nIntroducing the Programmatic Order Framework, from CoW Protocol\n\nInvestment Disclosure.

MEV is an additional form of revenue for validators beyond the block subsidy and transaction fees they earn by default - which has created a critical shift in incentive dynamics and end-user outcomes.\n\nBlock production is a 24/7 continuous process which requires a lot of computational effort - decentralized exchanges see billions in transaction volume per week (often per day), and computational effort comes at the cost of transaction, or gas fees. Processing transactions sequentially, in ‘true order,’ is not quite attractive - the actors involved in the block production process are incentivized to not only cover the costs of their efforts but also to make a profit (oftentimes a significant one at that). Therefore, transactions in a block are ordered by gas fee - highest paying transactions are placed at the top of the block. For the user, getting to the top of the block (or as close to it as possible) means better settlement on a trade. Therefore transactions in a block are ordered by gas fee - highest paying transactions are placed at the top of the block. For the user, getting to the top of the block (or as close to it as possible) means better settlement on a trade. \n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nSubscribe\n\nTransactions on the blockchain are an abundant source of value - and resourceful entities compete with one another to capitalize on information asymmetries and network inefficiencies in order to extract the maximal extractable value. On Ethereum, validators are the ultimate beneficiaries of this design, as gas fees are an increasing function of the competition for transaction ordering. \n\nHow MEV Works\n\nValidators are incentivized to order transactions based on the fees paid per transaction, with priority going to the highest-paying transactions. However, users are not just competing with other users for priority inclusion - hiding in the shadows of the dark forest are searchers, taking advantage of information asymmetry to “win the game” of block priority. \n\nA searcher is simply someone who deploys a bot to constantly scour the public mempool for lucrative opportunities in pending transactions and then capture a profit by submitting their own replica transactions at the expense of the original transaction. To be a bit more specific, a lucrative opportunity could be a pending transaction which could impact an asset’s price when executed (i.e. a fairly big trade of a low-liquidity asset). Searchers who detect this opportunity will then replicate the transaction but pay a higher fee to get included in a block first. Validators don’t really care whether the transaction comes from a user or a searcher (in fact, searchers can vertically integrate with a builder or even run their own builder). \n\nThis is a relatively simplified description, but just consider that all these complexities are taking place while you, the user, are simply complaining about how much you paid for gas while waiting for your transaction to confirm.  \n\nTypes of MEV \n\nMEV is usually extracted through arbitrage - price discrepancies for a trading pair across different venues, such as blockchains, dApps, and even centralized exchanges. Value is captured when asset A is bought at a lower price on Venue A, and sold for a higher price on Venue B. Arbitrage can occur between two on-chain venues, or an off-chain: on-chain (see loss versus rebalancing). \n\nLiquidations are another opportunity for MEV extraction - collecting the discounted assets of a liquidated position on a borrow/lending protocol, though data shows that these opportunities are nowhere near as common as arbitrage. \n\nFront-running - A new transaction (A) is broadcasted with a higher gas price than an already pending transaction (B) so that A gets executed before B. \n\nThis is a common economic phenomenon in TradFi - trading firms front-running clients who have expressed their desire to execute a certain trade. In DeFi, regular users are the ones getting front-run and subjected to poor settlement on their trades. However, it is possible for MEV bots to get front-run too. \n\nBack-running: The inverse of front-running, back-running takes place when Transaction A is broadcast with a slightly lower gas price than already pending transaction B so that A gets executed right after B in the same block. \n\nSandwich Attacks: This strategy involves two transactions - one to front-run a transaction and bump up the asset’s price, and another to back-run the transaction and sell the asset for a lower price, creating worse settlement for the original transaction before the block has even been executed. The price of the asset will return to normal but the searcher will capture the difference between the original price and artificially inflated one.\n\nSandwich attack visualized (source)\nThe MEV Debate\ntweet (Frankie from Paradigm)\nMEV Continued.. \n\nOpinions around the MEV phenomenon and how to approach it vary - some argue MEV cannot be eliminated, only mitigated, while others have even argued that MEV is ultimately a fundamental part of blockchains’ economies. \n\nOn the one hand, MEV provides an economic incentive for sophisticated actors to stabilize prices and thus create more efficient DeFi markets - blockchains need validators to function, and validators need financial incentives to do their work. On the other hand, MEV subjects user trades to financial loss incurred by worse settlement and potentially disrupting network consensus in a worst-case scenario of a reorg. Furthermore, maximizing value capture requires above-average computational resources and often capital, benefiting institutions and larger validators. These resourceful validators can then open up staking pools offering higher yields than the competition, snowballing the centralizing effect of attracting more stake and more value capture. \n\nBlockchains are open and permissionless systems and those who are able to take advantage will do just that, but that doesn’t mean solutions to mitigate the externalities of adverse value extraction aren’t important (in fact they are the basis of this paper). \n\nThe different facets of MEV, in a Utopian vs Dystopian setting. Source \n\nThere is a general agreement within the research community that the internalization of MEV (returning the profits generated by MEV back to the end-user) is an important design choice to build for. This can be expressed in different designs which will be discussed in this paper - we believe their adoption will be important for the greater good of on-chain economies.\n\nMEV is an invisible tax extracted by specialized entities at the expense of regular users. \n\nUsers are the key drivers of the on-chain economy - therefore, user experience (UX) is a critical feature. This paper focuses largely on solutions for swapping assets, the most primitive and common form of transacting on-chain. If the average user cannot perform simple swaps in DeFi without getting the risk of being front-run or sandwiched (or even having to worry about this complexity), what is the use for DeFi long term besides a largely arbitrary idea of decentralization? What will stop on-chain users from eventually migrating back over to centralized solutions like CeFi platforms, which meet their needs without the MEV headaches?\n\nMEV-Mitigation Solutions\n\nUsers are incentivized to seek out solutions for MEV-protection for a simple reason - better price settlement (i.e. not losing $$ constantly to slippage). Instead of sending their transaction into the public mempool, where they are prone to being front-run or sandwiched, users can opt to send private transactions, which simply involve sending a transaction directly to a block builder using a private mempool. The builders are incentivized to access this exclusive transaction flow, as it allows them to build more valuable blocks. \n\nThe mempool is where unconfirmed transactions sit before they are confirmed by a validator.\n\nsource\n\nData from Blocknative shows that the number of private transactions jumped from ~1% in September 2022 to nearly 15% a year since. \n\nOrder Flow Auctions\n\nOrder Flow Auctions, or OFAs, are a mechanism designed to redistribute value extracted (MEV) from transactions back to the end-user by auctioning for the right to execute an order, and distributing the winning bid to the user. It is the on-chain implementation of Payment For Order Flow (PFOF) in TradFi.\n\nBlockspace aggregators like MEV-Blocker or MEV-Share allow users to plug in private RPC endpoints from their wallets, helping protect users from sandwiching and front-running and internalizing users’ MEV. Signed transactions are routed to a private mempool, in which searchers compete in an auction to process the transaction. The winning bid in the auction is then paid out to users (for example, MEV-Blocker implements a 90/10 user: validator redistribution split). \n\nIn this paper, we discuss several different OFA designs implemented by various DEX aggregators - Batch auctions (CoWSwap), RFQs (0x), and Dutch auctions (1inch, UniswapX). \n\nFor a thorough explanation of OFAs, check out this great piece from Frontier Tech. \n\nIntents\n\nsource\n\nIn the standard transaction process, users commit their transaction to a specific execution route once they sign it and submit them to the public mempool. This enables immediate execution but comes at the risk of loss of value in the trade due to MEV capture in the public mempool. This model also confines the user’s trade to one specific route, and assumes the user has selected the best possible one. \n\nOn the other hand, an intent is essentially a signed user message that states the desired final outcome (asset X for price Y) - without a commitment to a specific execution path. While the user maintains custody of the assets, the execution itself is outsourced to third parties who compete to find the best execution path among many different sources of liquidity (including their own private off-chain inventory i.e. spot positions on CEX) and provide the best price settlement possible for the user. \n\nAn easy way to think about this dynamic is in the context of one’s commute home from work, in a big city with various transportation modes. Hailing a cab on the street, or choosing which public transportation route to take ( bus A + train B or train A + train C etc) is like choosing a specific liquidity source in a standard transaction - you commit to a specific route under the assumption it is the fastest one home (often not guaranteed). On the other hand, if you use an app like Uber/Lyft or Google Maps, you are outsourcing the process of determining the best route for your commute to trusted, external parties. \n\nA more formal definition of intents from Paradigm: \n\n“Signed messages which allow for a set of state transitions from a given starting state, a special case of which is a transaction which allows for a unique transition.” \n\nThe benefits of using intents for placing swaps (as opposed to standard transactions) are centered around improved UX - this includes protection from front-running and sandwich attacks, accessing more sources of liquidity, abstracted gas fees, and avoiding failed transactions (as the order will not be executed if the users’ conditions are not met). \n\nThe Role of DEX Aggregators Today \n\nThough MEV dynamics play out in the block production process, applications are the sources of the MEV. Therefore we believe applications play an important role in the overall adoption of MEV-protection solutions for retail users. Blocknative recently published a research report highlighting the fact that private transactions using blockspace aggregator OFAs like MEV-Share and MEV-Blocker can actually create worse price settlement than their standard counterparts, as private transactions often don’t receive top-of-block priority. Even the CoWSwap team has stated that “CoW Swap should also do a better job of managing price impact than using MEV Blocker alone.”\n\nAggregators play a valuable role for traders in DeFi. Often dubbed ‘Meta-DEXs’, these protocols  provide smart order routing functionality across a number of different liquidity sources, providing swappers with better pricing, and in some cases, native MEV-protection.  \n\nThis paper will specifically focus on the top DEX aggregators offering some form of native MEV-protection on swaps - CoWSwap, 1inch Fusion, Matcha, and the emerging UniswapX. \n\nCoWSwap\n\nCoWswap is the first DEX aggregator built on top of CoW Protocol, enabling users to swap assets and place limit orders with native Mev-protection. CoW stands for “Coincidence of Wants” , a barter economy in which one party has an item they wish to sell, while the other party is looking to buy that specific item, and the two parties can directly transact in a P2P manner. In DeFi, this refers to one trader holding a token they would like to sell, and another trader looking to buy that same token from them. \n\nCoWSwap creates a private order flow marketplace enabling users looking to swap asset A for asset B for a defined price. Traders on CoWswap sign intents to express their desired trade outcome - these are then aggregated off-chain and settled in batches to be then executed on-chain. \n\nWith standard transaction ordering mechanisms today, searchers and block builders are incentivized to create as many different prices for the same asset within a block to capture what is ultimately a risk-free intra-block profit. CoW Protocol aims to solve this issue through a uniform price clearing mechanism that enables traders to get the same price for the same asset within the same block. \n\nInstead of a central operator, CoW protocol delegates order matching to a decentralized set of order matching engines known as solvers who compete via batch auctions to ‘solve’ for the optimal order settlement within the given constraints of a limit order. A solver is a computer program that takes the orderbook as input, and computes the prices and traded amounts of all orders and liquidity sources (AMMs). In a batch auction, solvers are incentivized to compete to find the best settlement solution for users’ orders (the route of execution among different liquidity sources) in order to win the right to execute the batch and capture the surplus within a trade. \n\nSince user orders are aggregated off-chain, users technically don’t need to pay gas fees on CoWSwap. There is an associated protocol fee - but this is only required once per token. \n\nA full trading cycle on CoWSwap looks like:\n\nApprove the Allowance Manager Contract in your wallet\n\nSign the order you want to place\n\nEnjoy the tokens you just traded.\n\nBarring some occasional spikes in months prior, CoWswap volume has remained consistent since April 2021. There are more returning traders than new ones, which indicates CoWswap has found PMF among a niche group of users but will likely need to up its user acquisition efforts moving forward as the intents-based application space is likely to become more crowded. \n\nIt is important to note having more solvers competing to fill batches creates a more competitive solver market and thus creates better price settlement for CoWSwap traders (there are currently 18 active solvers in V3 under this model on Ethereum).\n\n1inch Fusion\n\nFusion is the latest swap engine from 1inch, offering a gas-free swap experience with native MEV-protection. Users can choose between Auto, Fast, Fair, and Custom with various execution and rate parameters. \n\nA set of market makers known as resolvers handles the process of executing swaps, which are actually limit orders under the hood, by competing with other resolvers via Dutch Auctions to find the best rate for said transaction and execute it. Once an order is filled, the resolver then places it into a bundle with other orders, and is submitted for inclusion in a block. Note that since resolvers cover users’ gas fees, a settlement fee is charged to cover the costs on their end.\n\nEach order has an auction start timestamp - before the auction begins, an order can be filled at the start rate(the maximum rate that a user can receive). Once the auction begins, the order filling rate gradually decreases over time. The trade is divided into parts, which results in several price points, assuming that arbitrageurs will backrun and move the price back after each resolver’s trade. Users benefit from better rates, while resolvers make a profit from each transaction.\n\nSource\n\nAt the time of writing, Fusion has seen over $13b in cumulative volume, and 1.6m orders from 582,029 unique wallets since launching in late 2022. \n\nMatcha \n\nMatcha is a multi-chain DEX aggregator from the 0x team which allows users to trade tokens across Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, Bnb, Celo, Fantom, and Avalanche. Matcha aims to optimize price settlement for users by sourcing liquidity from both on-chain and off-chain venues. Users can execute traditional A for B swaps or place limit orders. \n\nMatcha enables users to opt into use private liquidity sources - a feature enabled by 0x’s Request-for-Quote (RFQ) system. RFQ enables users to sign an order for the trade they would like to make, and request a quote on their trade from a set of designated, off-chain market makers. The quote, representing a transaction execution path, is enforced by a smart contract, ensuring against slippage and thus sandwich attacks. The market makers are incentivized to beat the on-chain prices available on AMMs to be included in a quote, in addition to beating other RFQ market makers - the more competitive this system is, the better the price settlement.\n\nAn interesting stat to observe is that RFQ liquidity seems to favor smaller trades (<$100), indicating that this design benefits more retail and casual traders. \n\nsource\nFees \n\nMatcha does not charge additional fees on top of gas fees for most trades, but there are some exceptions for specific assets on limit orders. For example, Matcha Auto (new swap engine) charges a 0.15% fee on trades with native tokens. A full breakdown of Matcha fees can be found here\n\nUser guide\n\nTrading on Matcha is relatively straightforward - the first step is to connect your wallet, and select between making a regular swap or using a limit order. In order to opt in to RFQ liquidity, make sure you check for ‘0X RFQ’ in your liquidity sources in the transaction settings tab. \n\nUniswapX \n\nUniswapX is a new non-custodial, Dutch auction-based trading protocol from Uniswap that introduces new methods for routing and aggregating liquidity. UniswapX marks an industry shift towards utilization of off-chain liquidity for on-chain settlement. We say this because while UniswapX does not introduce entirely novel concepts, Uniswap has been the dominant DeFi protocol (captured over 50% of DEX volume this past year alone) so it is worth paying attention to the protocol’s developments. \n\nThe principle of UniswapX is a new liquidity marketplace which aims to benefit both LPs and traders- LPs to be properly compensated, and traders to enjoy better prices and abstracted gas costs. \n\nAfter a user submits a signed order stating their expressed trade intent, a network of fillers compete for the right to fill the order (fillers can be searchers, market makers, and/or other on-chain agents) in a dutch auction. It’s important to note here that the user can specify the filler that they would like to fill their order  - but once the auction begins, any order with better pricing can compete and win. Note that the system involves a Reactor contract for checking that the execution of a trade against the filler’s strategy matches the parameters set by the swapper, and an executor contract to be called to specify the filler’s strategy for fulfilling orders and actually executing the order. The goal here is to provide a better UX for swappers with improved price settlement and abstracted gas costs. \n\nDon’t worry - swappers do not have to engage in any sort of auction to execute a trade. \n\nOne of the key value propositions behind UniswapX is MEV-protection. UniswapX internalizes MEV - in other words, returns surplus value (MEV) back to traders in the form of improved price settlement . This embodies the key ‘mev-redistribution’ principle behind OFAs and is in part inspired by the original Mev-capturing Amm proposal. Additionally, orders executed by fillers’ cannot be sandwiched, and fillers are incentivized to bypass public mempools and use private transaction channels for on-chain settlement. \n\nUniswapX is still in beta, so analysis of user trends and activity should be taken with a grain of salt. \n\nImportant Risks And Considerations\n\nThe DEX aggregators we just listed utilize intent-based architecture to offer better UX and utility for users, but it is important to note a few critical issues with intent-based solutions and the implications of their widespread adoption. While user transactions may be safe from front-running and sandwich attacks within the public mempool, shifting the centralizing force of block builders to various middlemen imposes new risk vectors for both users and the ecosystem as a whole. Not only do on-chain LPs face greater difficulty, the widespread adoption of alternative mempools also poses risks of centralization, increased trust assumptions, and reduced transparency in the Ethereum ecosystem. \n\nIncreased Trust \n\nThe applications we have discussed in this paper require a set of trusted parties to fill user orders off-chain and execute them on-chain. This is an inherent tradeoff: bypassing the public mempool means there is that much more trust placed in the middlemen doing the actual bypassing. In the context of intent-based trading protocols, competition among the parties executing user orders is imperative for users to actually receive optimal pricing on assets. \n\nSome protocols are taking measures or have plans for further decentralization - for example, CoWSwap envisions transforming its centrally hosted order book to a distributed p2p client network in the future. However, these are often long-term developments, and in the short-term protocols will often implement trusted solutions that optimize for performance.  \n\nCoWSwap Solvers - Running a solver on CoWSwap involves significant knowledge and access to both on-chain and offchain liquidity sources, as well as strong predictive knowledge of slippage tolerances -  this is a comparatively similar skillset required for successfully running searchers. Solvers must be whitelisted in advance and follow a set of social consensus rules - though accountability is not enforced by smart contracts but rather by the CoW DAO, which can enforce penalties and slashing. \n\nNo provision of unfair solutions\n\nNo Inflation of the objective function\n\nNo illegal use of internal buffers\n\nIncorrectly reporting transacted values for encoded transactions\n\nOther malicious behavior causing intentional harm to the user or protocol\n\n1inch Resolvers - Running a resolver on 1inch Fusion requires whitelist approval and sufficient account balance to pay for order fees. Whitelist approval requires 1) obtaining necessary ‘unicorn power’ threshold - this involves staking more $1inch (longer lock-ups = more power),  2) registration, 3) Account Balance for fees. Resolvers are ranked, and are held accountable by rules set and enforced by the 1inch Network DAO, as well as their performance; if they are not able to maintain a top 10 ranking they cannot fill swaps. \n\n0x RFQ Market Makers - 0x utilizes private off-chain market makers for their RFQ liquidity system - in part, the system of the protocol itself holds market makers accountable, as the RFQ system only allows the specified taker address to fill an order, preventing front-running. While this dashboard provides comprehensive analytics for RFQ liquidity volume and trades and it is reasonable to assume there is some reputation or bonding-enforced mechanisms to keep MMs accountable, there are ultimately no definitive guidelines and rules available for what accountability looks like and how it is enforced. \n\nUniswapX Fillers - UniswapX outsources the process of transaction routing to an open network of fillers - who can tap into their own ‘private inventory’ to source liquidity for filling orders, private inventory being another word for off-chain liquidity. Currently, the filler role is only available to whitelisted entities during beta, but Uniswap intends to leave this role to be permissionless; according to Uniswap docs, requirements for creating a filler are simply a)defining a filler execution strategy and b) retrieving & executing discovered orders. \n\nThis raises questions about what filler accountability may look like in practice, as Uniswap has not yet released a framework. It would be reasonable to assume the implementation of economic incentives (i.e. bonding/slashing collateral) here, and whether the Uniswap DAO will play a role as X’s smart contracts and fee switch will be governed by the DAO. \n\nThis is an active area of research and will definitely be interesting to keep an eye on moving forward. \n\nThough there are measures in place to ensure market makers/fillers/solvers are acting in good faith and only reputable entities are able to fill orders, and permissionless mempools face their own set of challenges, shifting more user activity to a new system that only increases trust assumptions does not contribute to a more decentralized DeFi ecosystem. Universal solutions for solver accountability, such as “reputation based systems to build trust with the users based on their repeated engagement and enforcement of accountability” , are evidently an important missing piece of the puzzle that needs to be accounted for if adoption of intent-based architectures continues to grow. \n\nLess Transparency  \n\nComputing the order filling logic off-chain is critical for providing better UX (i.e., abstracted gas costs for users, protection from front-running and sandwiching) but it also comes at the cost of greater opacity in the overall block production of Ethereum. Private/permissioned mempools are just that - private. Analytics for these systems is limited, and a mass migration of user activity to private mempools and off-chain liquidity means that much less observability for both sleuths and the general public. \n\nSlower Execution Times\n\nAnother caveat with intent-based trading protocols is that they often take longer to execute. For example, orders on CoWSwap and 1inch Fusion take up to 30 seconds to execute.  Slower execution time can lead to worse price settlement as the price of the asset can change in the time prior to an order getting filled. \n\nThe process to determine the ‘ideal’ intent-based architecture still lies ahead, but it helps to reference this quote from Paradigm’s piece on intents: \n\n“permissionless so that anyone can match and execute intents while not trading off much execution quality; general so that deploying new applications doesn’t require standing up new mempools; and transparent so that the process by which intents are executed is reported publicly and data for execution quality auditing is made available, when privacy guarantees allow.” \n\nDex aggregators play an important role in DeFi in helping traders swap assets with better price settlement due to their underlying mechanisms in which a set of market makers compete to provide the best price settlement for their trade. That said, they still pose constraints as settlement routes are restricted to their liquidity sources, not to mention new trust assumptions and reduced transparency in DeFi. Therefore when we consider the role of DEX aggregators moving forward, it is important to consider future developments in the intents landscape as well as the broader MEV-protection landscape.\n\nFuture Outlook for MEV-Protection and Intents \n\nWe believe the rise of private transactions in the past year indicates growth in overall demand for MEV-protection solutions within DeFi. More users are becoming aware of the invisible MEV tax and how it affects their on-chain trading experience (it wasn’t too long ago that the jaredfromsubway.eth MEV bot was a phenomenon on Crypto Twitter) - and are thus more actively seeking solutions to protect their transactions from this tax. Though teams like CoW Protocol, 0x, and 1inch have been around for some time now, we are beginning to see a greater shift in interest and development around MEV-protection solutions - as leaders in DeFi like Uniswap begin to leverage MEV-protection as a value proposition (UniswapX, Uniswap Wallet). \n\nWallets and Order Flow Auctions \n\nIt is evident that wallets have and will continue to play a critical role in the MEV supply chain - wallets have been enabling users to set custom RPC endpoints such as  Flashbots RPC ,  Mevblocker RPC , and Rabbithole (1inch) to send their transactions to an OFA for some time now. Most recently, Uniswap Wallet has introduced their Swap Protection feature, which natively integrates MEV-Blocker. \n\nThe more intuitive and integrated MEV-protection solutions are, the more users will actually get to benefit from them. However, as we mentioned earlier it is important to consider the performance of these transactions may oftentimes be worse than regular transactions given they must compete for top-of-block priority for optimal settlement. The takeaway is that convenience != performance. \n\nAccount Abstraction and Intents\n\nIntents have the potential to unlock a new paradigm of end-user experience - though we focus on swaps in this paper, we can consider further use cases such as intents for automation regularly occurring processes to improve crypto UX and make users’ lives easier (i.e. moving funds from cold to hot wallets or purchasing X amount of assets on a regularly occurring basis) The point is, we are still early in the overall adoption of intents. \n\nAccount abstraction utilizes intents to provide better UX; using smart-contract accounts as opposed to the traditional EOAs will make it easier for users to natively submit generalized intents (called user operations or ‘userOps’) to express a desired outcome  So far, there have been 5,972,635 userOps submitted across 1007615 users since March. As account abstraction is expected to grow in adoption, we expect intents to have a greater impact on the DeFi ecosystem and crypto UX as a whole.\n\nThat said, it is important to note that ERC 4337 also imposes new vectors for MEV extraction. Bundlers, who are responsible for aggregating userOps submitted to the Alt Mempool, oversee the contents of userOps and can therefore reorder userOps in the most profitable order. If submitted to the public mempool, the bundle is then also subject to the traditional front-running and sandwich attacks. This two-fold MEV system leaks additional value from user transactions towards validators and introduces a further adversarial MEV environment. \n\nFurthermore, given the resources and skill-set needed to run a competitive bundler is similar to those needed to run a competitive builder (therefore benefiting resourceful entities), we can assume a handful of existing builders will seek to run bundlers as an additional MEV stream on top of the public mempool. To quote Matt Cutler “ERC-4337 changes everything & nothing”\n\nA broader takeaway is that it is important to look beyond the guise of the improved UX account abstraction can bring, and consider the impact of ERC 4337 on user price settlement in the short and long term. \n\nWithin the context of our paper, it is also interesting to consider whether or not we see MEV-protection solutions integrate userOp bundles, or if the further adversarial MEV environment under ERC 4337 prompts more adoption of MEV-protection solutions instead. \n\nGeneral-Purpose Infrastructure for Intents\n\nAlthough intents are not new, its applied utility has been limited to trading assets thus far. However, a number of teams have been working on general-purpose infrastructure for intents to enable developers to build intent-centric applications, and help mitigate centralization risks. further use-cases including auctions, crowdfunding, P2P Lending, OTC NFT Lending, and various other automated processes. Some critical developments include:\n\nSUAVE (short for Single Unifying Auction for Value Expression). Flashbots is building a MEV-aware, intent-centric architecture built to allow chains to outsource the block builder and mempool roles by providing a shared sequencing layer. The stack consists of: a mempool where users can specify preferences (intents), an execution network where solvers compete to execute user preferences, and a block building environment. The goal is to decentralize the existing transaction/mev supply chain, while benefiting the parties involved - builders and validators can increase their returns, and users can transact with better execution. \n\nAnoma: intents-as-a-service for blockchains. Anoma is a “unified architecture for full-stack decentralized applications” built from the ground up to enable greater adoption of intents by unifying settlement and counterparty discovery mechanisms, and preserving user privacy. This will enable applications to integrate various intent-based services and features for their users. \n\nEssential is building intent-based infrastructure and tooling to “to accelerate the transition from value extraction to intent satisfaction”, including a universal DSL for intents, an intent-centric standard for account abstraction (ERC 7521, a proposed alternative to ERC 4337), and a modular protocol with native support for intents. \n\nIt is important to note that these solutions are not going to be fully implemented in practice in the near future, and their true impact will only be realized in the long term. As we said before, we are early in the early stages of the intents landscape. Likewise, we are still early to developing a universal “tried and true” approach to dealing with the externalities with MEV. \n\nConclusion \n\nAs more users have begun to seek out ways to protect their transaction value from MEV, the concept of redistributing MEV seems to have become a commonly accepted one among researchers today, leading to an uptick in MEV-protection solutions. While traders in DeFi today have a handful of options to choose from for this purpose, they must also weigh the considerations and tradeoffs that come with intent-based trading protocols. Although not a new concept, intent-based protocols are still fairly nascent and underdeveloped, which is a critical point for those navigating this space. We encourage you to form your own opinions on the MEV debate and consider the evolving ecosystem with a critical eye. With the continuous innovations and commitment from project teams, the future for MEV protection looks promising and is poised for further value-add to end-users.\n\n\nSources \n\nEnablement of MEV and the Morals of Extracting\n\nFlashbots: Frontrunning the MEV crisis\n\nEigenPhi\n\nSandwich MEV - EigenPhi Classroom\n\nThe Orderflow Auction Design Space\n\nThe False Narrative of MEV Protection: How Private Transactions Can Result in a Poorer Settlement Than Sending Publicly\n\nIntent-Based Architectures and Their Risks\n\nAn Incomplete Primer on Intents — Emperor\n\nCoW Protocol Overview\n\nThe most common types of MEV and protection from toxic strategies\n\nWhat is a sandwich attack?\n\nUnlock optimal trades in Swap API with 0x RFQ liquidity\n\nA comprehensive analysis of RFQ performance\n\nUniswapX\n\nIntent-based protocols pt1: unfolding UniswapX | Blog - Anoma\n\nIntroducing Essential: We Are Intents\n\nIntroductory Guide to Account Abstraction (ERC-4337)\n\nInvestment Disclosure.

Additional contributions were also made by 0xMoe.\n\nIntro \n\n\"Monkey see, monkey do\" aptly characterizes the speculative Gamblefi underworld of crypto, where traders are driven by daily 100x gains, exit rugs, and liquidity pulls. Memecoins hold a unique allure in this realm, especially as traders follow both market pumps and influencers who shill (promote) these pumps on Twitter. Platforms like Banana Gun have emerged to equip users with the essential tools for high-speed trading.\n\nMaestro led the field a few years ago, initially gaining traction under its original name, Catchy. Maestro was the go-to platform for snipers traders looking to capitalize on short-term market fluctuations. Then came Unibot, which improved the space by focusing less on snipers and more on the average users frustrated by Uniswap's less-than-user-friendly UI. They focused strategically on referral fees to drive rapid growth, a tactic similar to what we've seen with platforms like Rollbit and Stake.\n\nMost recently, Banana has entered the scene, offering a competitive product to Maestro in sniping capabilities and more favorable in terms of fees. Banana seems poised to capture the hearts of the \"degen\" traders, those willing to take extreme risks for potentially enormous rewards.\n\nThis fluid landscape underscores the constant evolution of platforms and strategies in the Gamblefi underworld of crypto, each striving to meet its user base's ever-changing demands and risk appetites.\n\n9-5 Speculation \n\nAmidst the bear market and all-time low DEX volume since 2020, hundreds of ERC-20 tokens are deployed daily. For some traders, watching the memecoin market is a full-time job. All it takes is a 100x on a project to become highly profitable by purchasing among the first few and riding a token to a multi-million market cap. Traders can participate in multiple ways, including presales, sniping, and buying the token spot. \n\nPresale: Allocating money ahead of the token launch.\n\nSniping: Automatically buying tokens using bots at the time of launch. \n\nSpot: Tokens purchased outright on exchanges like Uniswap or Coinbase.\n\nTraders tend to decide their strengths and choose a few categories to focus their energy. Within this process, we will focus mainly on the sniping phase; let's dive in further.  \n\nToken Snipers \n\nBefore the advent of Telegram snipers, the game was all about expertise. Top coin snipers and botters would meticulously analyze memecoin contracts to identify critical functions triggering a coin's launch, maximum transaction sizes, and any developer-implemented measures to deter early buyers. With the advent of Telegram bots like Banana Gun and Maestro, that granular approach has been largely replaced.\n\nIn a nutshell, token snipers are automated trading bots that enable users to execute swift buy and sell orders for newly launched tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap. Many of these bots use Telegram as a platform. Developers prefer Telegram because it is where trade ideas thrive and it's also a crypto-native messaging app. The product-market fit for token snipers is clear, as users have adopted them at an increasing rate. Sniper bots can also purchase launched tokens with similar speed and efficiency, making up a majority of their trading volumes.\n\nThese premier sniping bots now simulate entire contract functionalities, allowing users to bypass the user interfaces of platforms like Uniswap and simply decide how much ETH they want to deploy. This shift has made the sniping landscape more user-friendly but also intensely competitive.\n\nFor example, in the case of Maestro, users still need to input maximum transaction sizes, and some familiarity with contract methods is necessary under the non-premium model. This is where Banana distinguishes itself—no such expertise is required, streamlining the process even further.\n\nThis evolution can be contrasted with platforms like Uniswap, which recently removed its expert mode. While this change may benefit retail traders by adding a layer of safety against high-impact trades, it complicates matters for advanced traders who are now forced to adjust their strategies manually. The removal of expert mode has impacted sophisticated traders to the point they built their own front ends to improve the experience. It underscores why Telegram sniping bots like Banana Gun, designed for a more sophisticated user base, are gaining traction in the fiercely competitive landscape of ERC-20 token trading. By using these bots, traders not only optimize their strategies but also avoid the limitations imposed by retail-focused decentralized exchange interfaces.\n\nHow does Sniping work?\n\nImagine a trader eyeing the launch of $TOKEN in a few days. They simply load up their Telegram application and drop the smart contract into a token sniper. After specifying the amount of ETH they're willing to risk, it's a waiting game. As soon as the token hits the DEX pool, the Telegram sniper triggers, executing the pre-defined trade parameters. If all goes as planned, the trader enters at a 10k MCAP (hypothetical example), which skyrockets to 200k MCAP in a matter of seconds—a tidy 20x profit. But it's not that simple anymore. The efficacy of these sniper bots has led to an influx of traders employing the same strategy, often using ten or more wallets to edge out the competition.\n\nThat's why just having a sniper bot isn't enough today; timing is crucial. Enter Banana Gun. Unlike other platforms that require manual inputs or specific monitoring, Banana Gun optimizes the process. Once the contract is added to the bot before the token's trading begins, Banana's snipers automatically look for smart contract triggers like the \"EnableTrading\" function, which will snipe/buy a token as soon as it launches.\n\nSnipers can also monitor for “liquidity add” transactions, which is adding ETH to the token pool, which would enable trading now that there is liquidity. \n\nBanana Gun \n\nBanana Gun has fundamentally democratized the sniping landscape in the crypto space. Previously, sniping was an exclusive activity reserved for individuals with advanced technical skills who could read and configure smart contracts. Banana Gun has opened this door for everyone by automating much of the sniping experience. Their platform is designed with exceptional ease of use: You paste a contract and let the bot handle the complexities, such as determining the method ID, tax rate, and maximum transaction size. This feature sets them apart from competitors like Maestro, where users are required to read contract addresses and configure settings manually.\n\nThe cornerstone of Banana Gun's unique selling proposition lies in its user-centric focus on automation and protection against most rug pulls. Going beyond mere automation, each transaction on Banana Gun is executed privately and comes with an Ethereum bribe set by the user. This clever mechanism gives you an extra layer of safety. In an environment where someone tries to execute a rug pull (scam) with an exorbitant gas fee, Banana Gun enables you to front-run them cost-effectively. The private transaction feature also ensures you can never get sandwiched or front-run. A sandwich is when traders (bots) exploit transaction ordering by placing trades before and after a user's transaction. In fact, Banana Gun goes a step further by reverting your transaction if they detect a risk of it getting sandwiched—even though it's executed privately. This nuanced feature is something that even competitors like Maestro lack.\n\nSpeed kills, and Banana Gun is currently one of the fastest retail sniper bots on the market. It first launched in early June and has already amassed roughly 700 daily users, with over 12,000-lifetime users.\n\nBot usage\n\nWhen users buy, the interface is moved to a sell channel, where users can focus on the mechanics of selling. Typically, other sniper bots buy and sell in a single interface.\n\nCore Features\nBlock 0 Bribe Wars\n\nBribing is a cornerstone feature of Banana Gun, but it's worth noting that Maestro initially pioneered the concept of group bribing. Maestro's system made it extremely difficult for individual botters or snipers to outbribe a group of participants, effectively democratizing the process.\n\nBanana Gun, however, brought a fresh angle to this approach. While Maestro may have introduced group bribing, Banana Gun perfected it by attracting a smaller but more sophisticated and experienced user base. These individuals are well-versed in the mechanics of sniping and understand how to outbribe even a collective group.\n\nBanana Gun utilizes a custom RPC, a specialized node that communicates directly with the blockchain, allowing faster data transmission than standard providers like Infura or Alchemy. In this high-speed environment, pending transactions from Banana Gun's elite snipers are bundled together into a single transaction package. This bundle is then forwarded to the block builder, the Ethereum network validator responsible for grouping transactions.\n\nThe battle heats up when the bundle reaches the block builder. Banana Gun snipers engage in blind bribing, where each participant offers a hidden bribe, also known as a \"tip,\" to secure faster transaction confirmation. Take User A, for example, who buys Token X for 0.20 ETH and includes a bribe of 0.10 ETH. This bribe directly incentivizes the block builder to confirm User A's transaction more quickly. Should the token involve a transaction tax, User A may find themselves down initially until the token gains in value.\n\nThe blind nature of these bribes adds a layer of strategy and unpredictability to the transaction process. Since you can't see others' bribes and they can't see yours, your experience and savvy become your greatest assets. This explains how Banana Gun consistently outperforms in the race to Block 0 despite having a smaller community. The amalgamation of a fast custom RPC, bundled transactions, and the art of blind bribing gives Banana Gun a distinctive, competitive edge, making it a powerhouse in the realm of token sniping. This unique trifecta streamlines the trading process and creates an environment where skill, strategy, and speed converge, setting Banana Gun apart from its competitors.\n\nMax Spend\n\nBanana Gun has made crucial updates to tackle one of its initial flaws: the absence of user control over sniping limits. In its early stages, the bot automatically buys whatever amount the user set. However, it left some traders susceptible to sandwich attacks. Early snipers could outmaneuver others by over bribing, essentially \"trapping\" latecomers in disadvantageous positions: a sandwich.\n\nTo solve this, Banana Gun added slippage controls and limit orders into its transaction bundles. Now, users can define a 'MAX SPEND' limit in ETH, which caps both the tokens and gas they're willing to expend. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with tokens that have a set maximum transaction amount, meaning the token contract code limits the maximum amount which can be purchased in a single transaction. If a user caps their spend at, say, '0.25 ETH,' the bot will keep the total expenditure—including gas—under this limit. If the maximum allowed transaction is reached, any leftover ETH is returned to the user.\n\nAn essential new feature, added based on user feedback, ensures that if the transaction can't meet the maximum allowable purchase, it will automatically be reversed. This protective measure is vital for preventing scenarios where a user gets a minuscule amount of tokens but pays a hefty price due to prior high bribes by others. This update adds a layer of risk mitigation, making the sniping game more strategic. \n\nThese enhancements level the playing field, allowing Banana Gun users to navigate both cutthroat and cooperative trading scenarios with more confidence.\n\nTrading Revenue\n\nTraders use the product, but you might still wonder if developing a trading infrastructure like Banana Gun is worth anyone's time. Ultimately, Banana Gun generates 10-25+ ETH per day in trading fees. This is with the absence of token revenues (as of September 15th), which for Unibot adds additional trading fees to their volumes. \n\nVolume and Fees \nCompetitive Landscape\n\nThere are a few other bots that compete in the sniper space, including Maestro, and Unibot, which are the largest snipers. Maestro has had the largest user base overall. When looking at bot usage by day, Banana Gun recently flipped Maestro for a few days.\n\nSource\nMarket Structure \n\nCurrently, the total bot user base stands at over 100k, and the number of daily active users since August has consistently exceeded 4,000. Several leading products accounted for more than 90 percent of the users—specifically Maestro, Banana Gun, and Unibot.\n\nRevenue and Fee Structure\n\nAs of September 15th, 2023, Banana Gun reported a transaction fee income of 756 ETH, over $1.2 million. Banana Gun adopts a low-fee model, charging only 0.5% on gross buys and sells, appealing to its smaller but more sophisticated user base.\n\nIt's essential to understand the fee structure to see why Banana Gun's average daily fee income is lower despite its transaction speed and strategy edge. In contrast, Maestro charges 1% on gross buys and sells and even offers a premium membership at $200 monthly for additional features. Unibot, another competitor, has a different model altogether—its revenue comes from tax volume as part of their fee structure.\n\nThe term \"gross\" is crucial here. If you make a 10 ETH trade and break even (Buy 10 ETH/Sell 10 ETH), you're still liable for fees based on the gross trade amount. With Maestro, you'd pay 0.1 ETH when you buy and another 0.1 ETH when you sell, totaling 0.2 ETH. In the case of Banana Gun, you'd pay 0.005 ETH each for buying and selling, summing up to just 0.01 ETH. This stark difference in fee structures partly explains Banana Gun's lower daily transaction fee income but also represents a competitive advantage for users who are sensitive to costs.\n\nBy breaking down the fee differences, one can see why Banana Gun, despite having fewer daily active users, provides an attractive alternative for experienced traders seeking to minimize costs while maximizing strategy.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

By using intents, users get more flexibility on the outcomes of their transactions. \n\nIf a transaction says \"do A then B, pay exactly C to get X back\", an intent says \"I want X and I'm willing to pay up to C\". - Paradigm \n\nSince BananaGun doesn't route swaps to a third party for execution, it typically won't be considered intent-based swaps. However, we may see tools like Banana Gun auction or fulfill swap orders on behalf of the users or use the request for quote (RFQ) model, which allows users to submit an order for fulfillment off-chain. Banana Gun currently facilitates interaction with blockbuilders, allowing transactions to be processed faster, achieving launch snipes. Down the line, snipers might move to off-chain solutions to fulfill swaps for early snipes or general swaps. In theory, a user could sign a transaction confirming they would like to spend X, and Banana Gun processes the transaction on behalf of the user or send it to a sophisticated actor for an additional fee. \n\nIntent-Based Architectures and Their Risks\nRisks\n\nLike most protocols, Banana Gun is not without risks. Risks are usually uniform among defi protocols, including economic exploits or smart contract risk. Economic exploits are when the monetary system within the protocol mechanics are exploited, whereas smart contract exploits can be found with unaudited code. Both risks potentially exist in sniper bots. \n\nSecurity Risks\n\nSecurity risks extend beyond smart contract vulnerabilities when it comes to Banana Gun. The bot has access to users' private keys, which means that the bot project team technically has control over the users' funds. To mitigate this risk, most traders only keep sufficient funds in the Telegram wallet to execute trades, transferring the rest to a more secure wallet.\n\nThere's always the risk that a mishap could expose the private key data. However, it's worth mentioning that both Banana Gun and Maestro delete your private key within the telegram UI as soon as it is provided by the user or generated within the app. In the case of Banana Gun, if you forget or misplace your private key, the platform can't retrieve it for you. The keys are stored on a separate encrypted server, accessible only to the bot, and undergo multiple layers of security, including marshaling, hashing, and conversion. Marshaling packages data for secure storage, hashing converts this data into a one-way, non-reversible string, and conversion further scrambles the data into an unreadable format, collectively ensuring the highest level of private key protection.\n\nBribe Fees\n\nBeing the fastest comes with a cost. Like a cheetah that can run extremely fast, the downside is the time they need to rest. With Banana Gun, users can end up over bribing for tokens based on pure hype and speculation, eating into profits. If “sniper A” bribes 0.1 ETH but a competitor, “sniper B” bribes 0.2 ETH, “sniper A” can buy at a higher market cap than the other sniper. In some cases, irrational bribes are added, leading to losses for many parties involved. Bribes are not refundable and are fully sent to the block builder. \n\nConclusion \n\nBanana Gun stands out as one of the fastest, cheapest, and most robust sniper bots, primarily focusing on execution timing. By allowing snipers to win Block 0 wars, many trader successes can be attributed to banana guns efficiently and transaction bundling architecture. \n\nBanana Guns' consistent growth at the depth of the bear market is a testament to the utility and demand for the product. Although sniping is mildly complex, Banana Gun's user base remains strong, with over 700 users per day in just a few months while taking in over 10 ETH per day in recent weeks. \n\nThe token sniper user base is relentless and draws no loyalties to branding, so the Banana Gun team must continue to iterate and ensure they have a competitive product.\n\nSources \n\nBanana Gun Bot 🍌🔫🤖\n\nMaestro Sniper Bot 🤖\n\nUnibot Revenue 🦄🤖📊\n\nhttps://dune.com/whale_hunter/dex-trading-bot-wars\n\nBanana Gun\n\nhttps://docs.maestrobots.com/god-mode/maestro-block-0-dominance \n\nhttps://twitter.com/UniswapVillain/status/1692979624181928138?s=20\n\nInvestment Disclosure.

Centralized exchanges often exclude these assets due to factors like low liquidity and dependence on traditional market makers. Whether it be Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, or even aggregators like MetaMask and 1inch, AMMs have facilitated trillions of dollars of value since inception just a few years ago. DEX's permissionless design makes them an ideal platform to trade low liquidity or long tail assets (assets not included in top trading volumes) since anyone can create a market for new assets. Unlike a traditional CEX, which has to integrate assets manually, AMMs allow seamless deployment and trading of any ERC-20 token as long as someone provides liquidity. This is because AMMs allow anyone to deposit assets and become a market maker, as opposed to needing to be an institutional entity like in traditional finance (TradFi). Market makers add liquidity through buy and sell orders on exchanges to ensure that users can execute trades even when no other users are present. They earn money by capitalizing on the spread, which is the difference between the buying and selling prices.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nSubscribe\n\nHowever, most spot* AMMs are extremely vanilla and typically only support buy and sell orders. Other spot AMMs and aggregators offer advanced features like limit orders and deep liquidity (enough liquidity for large entities to trade). However, they still cannot convert their liquidity into other trading primitives. DeFi primitives are the simplest building blocks.\n\n“Spot markets are also referred to as “physical markets” or “cash markets” because trades are swapped for the asset effectively immediately.” - Investopedia \n\nIt is often said in the product world that products need a 10x improvement to displace incumbents and experience significant adoption. The introduction of DEXs like Uniswap, solved a unique liquidity issue by allowing users to create a market for any ERC-20 at lightning speed.\n\nDEXs like Uniswap and Curve have been battle-tested long enough to be used as primitives for other products.\n\nDeFi primitives are the essential “building blocks” that can be combined to create DeFi functionalities of a higher order. - Binocs\n\nSimilar to the DEX spot markets, other trading products like Perpetual Futures (Perps) and Options are also hyper-competitive and still dominated by CEXs with regard to trading volume. Although CEXs dominate, there still is a large opportunity for Perps, options, and other trading products to grow exponentially by harnessing the composability of DeFi, the stacking of DeFi “Legos,” or applications that can build upon each other.  \n\nMost on-chain Perps and derivatives have few assets, use oracles, and are susceptible to liquidity issues. Without sufficient liquidity, derivative exchanges are unable to function and attract more users, which is the so-called chicken-egg problem. Here lies a sizable opportunity for the 10x \"Uniswap\" moment for on-chain derivatives by enabling leverage, Perps, and option trading products for any asset. To make this possible, new protocols are using concentrated and constant function AMM liquidity to power new trading products (leverage, Perps, and options). Simply put, protocols harness AMMs like Uniswap as a liquidity primitive to create new trading products.\n\nConstant Function AMM: Liquidity is typically spread across a full range of prices infinitely (Uniswap v2, Balancer). \n\nConcentrated Liquidity AMM: Liquidity is concentrated to a price range (Uniswap v3). \n\nUniswap v3 Whitepaper\nPerps and Options Uniswap Moment\n\nThe killer use case with AMM-powered trading products is being able to create Perpetual futures (Perps), Hybrid-Options, and other volatility markets for illiquid and newly deployed assets. $PEPE, during its boom, soared to a multi-billion dollar market cap in just a few weeks. During this period of extreme volatility, traders repeated the continuous question:\n\n“Where can I long $PEPE”\n\nSource: CoinGecko, Pepe by MCAP\n\nAlthough PEPE's popularity has grown immensely, garnering billions in volume and turning into a household name, there were initially only spot markets to trade the asset. Shortly after a few weeks, some opportunist exchanges enabled Perpetual (Perps) trading and continued to be the only sources even up to now. Even among some of the exchanges that enabled $PEPE trading, many traders believed there were issues with handling liquidations and payouts, a core concern in Perpetual exchange design. With AMM-powered volatility products and derivatives, there is an opportunity for on-chain market makers known as Liquidity Providers (LPs) to market-make options and Perpetuals at token launch, akin to Uniswap.\n\nThere is plenty of speculative demand for crypto assets, especially regarding leverage. Outside of leverage, these products provide great tools to hedge LP positions on assets. Hedging is opening another trade to lower the initial investment risk deliberately.\n\nPerpetual Trading Products \n\nMany on-chain Perpetual contracts (Perps) rely on oracles, which can be easy to manipulate for long-tail assets. Oracles take off-chain data and make it accessible on-chain for protocols to use, commonly used for price feeds. Ever wonder why only a few assets are supported on Perp Decentralized Exchanges? Most on-chain Perps and options platforms offer just a handful of assets geared towards deep liquidity and utilize an external oracle for the pricing mechanism. Liquidation risk is also a significant issue since managing liquidations depends on accurate oracles and ensuring that trades can be liquidated to meet collateral requirements in a timely manner. In other words, liquidations need to occur seamlessly to ensure that collateral is available to cover trades. With concentrated liquidity AMM (CLAMM) powered trading products, oracle, and liquidation risks are typically eliminated, as the liquidity is borrowed from a predefined LP range.\n\nBy adopting this approach, the risk is also predefined for the trader and limited to the parameters set by the exchange protocol for closing positions. Many AMM LP-enabled protocols employ a Perpetual mechanism for trade duration, which allows the trade duration to roll over as long as the fees are paid to keep the position open.\n\nAMM and LP Fees\n\nCLAMMs (Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Makers) and CFAMMs (Constant Function Automated Market Makers) constitute dual-party markets involving Liquidity Providers (LPs) and traders. For traders, the experiences across AMM products are mostly similar. Conversely, many exchanges strive to optimize the liquidity-providing experience since it frequently results in losses. In numerous instances, LPs need additional incentives to become profitable.\n\nMany Liquidity Providers add liquidity to AMMs based on the assumption that they will receive fees sufficient to offset impermanent loss (IL), a theoretical loss incurred by LPs when the price of the deposited tokens changes. It is also important to note that all LPs are not benchmarking against a HODL strategy. One of the core improvements in the concentrated AMM liquidity derivatives model is that LPs are now compensated in volatility, not just trading fees. This innovation introduces a new dimension to the rewards of liquidity provision. \n\nUniswap: A Good Deal for Liquidity Providers?\n\nFor some AMM-powered derivatives like infinity pools and Panoptic (Panoptic Option Sellers), LPs can generate fees when their LP is within range, and commission fees when both in and out of range. When the LP token goes out of range, it can be used for the protocol's volatility product, whether it be leverage, margin, or options trading. This architecture allows for enhanced yield for LPs who usually have a subpar experience when providing liquidity. \n\nAMM LP-Powered trading products - How do they work?\n\nThe current protocols offering AMM-powered trading derivatives abide by the simple assumption that providing LP in a CLAMM is akin to short puts. In other words, the liquidity-providing payoff structure is mathematically similar to selling put contracts. Perpetual and volatility trading protocols are able to structure trading derivatives and strategies around this concept, creating leverage, Perps, Perpetual options, and other structured products.\n\nPantopic Uniswap v3 Options payoff\nProtocol Landscape\n\nCurrently, there are a handful of protocols aiming to leverage CFAMM and CLAMM liquidity for trading purposes. Among them, a few trading products exist, including Leverage and Margin trading, Option products, Perpetual futures, and more. As nascent as the concept may be, many builders find opportunities to fill the liquidity and asset gap for major and long-tail assets within trading products. The following table shows the protocols, their liquidity AMM, and the trading product created:\n\n \n\n Let’s look further into the mechanisms and design. \n\nPerpetual Option Mechanism Design\n\nProtocols like Panoptic and Smilee utilize concentrated liquidity LP to power their trading products, specifically Perpetual options and volatility trading, respectively. Among the handful of protocols leveraging existing AMM concentrated liquidity, each presents a slightly different architecture and implementation in how they are crafting trading products.\n\nAt a high level, protocols draw concentrated liquidity from AMMs like Uniswap v3, or their own AMM and permit traders to borrow these assets. Traders then redeem the underlying LP token for a single asset, simulating a long or short position constrained by the range of the concentrated liquidity. Due to the nature of concentrated liquidity positions, when out of range, they always consist of 100% of one of the two assets in the pair (e.g., USDC/ETH). Since LPs expect 100% of one of the two assets in the pool, traders pay a fee to borrow and redeem the LP pair, receiving one of the assets. Depending on their trading strategy, they can sell the redeemed token, turning it into a directional bet.\n\nLong ETH example \n\nFor a Perpetual options example, let's say a trader wants to borrow a USDC/ETH LP token where the price of ETH is $1000. The trader wishes to go long on ETH, so they borrow an out-of-range USDC/ETH LP token below the current price, which would be worth $1000 of USDC. The LP token is valued at $1000 USDC because the current price has moved to the right side of the range, leaving the LPer (options seller) with 100% USDC. The option buyer's strike can be considered as the midpoint of the LP range; we'll use 900 for this example. Since the trader is long, they redeem the LP token worth $1000 USDC and swap it for 1 ETH, also worth $1000. If the price of ETH moves up to $1500, and since ETH is now valued more than what the options buyer purchased it for, they can exercise the option by selling the 1 ETH for $1500. This amount is sufficient to pay back the borrower and yield an additional $500 profit. The options buyer only repays $1000 to the LP since that is the end of the range in which they are providing liquidity.\n\nProtocols typically abstract most of the complexity from this experience. Users may expect to deposit collateral to cover position funding, select position duration (if included), strike price, and trade direction.\n\nLong ETH trade cont..  \n\nIf the trade doesn't go as planned and ETH goes down to $800, which is out of the LP range in the opposite direction, they will now owe 1 ETH instead of USDC. Since the borrower still owes 1 ETH to the lender, they need to find a way to obtain 1 ETH to repay the loan. If the value of 1 ETH is $800, the borrower needs to use $800 worth of USDC to purchase 1 ETH to settle the debt.\n\nThe DEX manages the underlying assets for protocols like panoptic to ensure LPs get paid. Instead of paying a premium to purchase the option upfront, Panoptic requires users to have starting collateral in their wallet to cover a streaming fee similar to a funding rate. Collateral is needed to guarantee that the fee can be paid. The fee is based on realized volatility in the underlying Uniswap pool and liquidity utilization to determine how much the option buyer should pay the seller (LP). Traders positions will close when they stop paying the funding fee or it exceeds their collateral.\n\nIn both examples, the option seller will take constant streamed fees for the position to remain open. This is a general overview pertinent to panoptic as each protocol has different methods for managing liquidity, offering leverage, calculating collateral, premium, and funding fees.\n\nFrom a birds eye view, trades are two-sided, where LPs deposit their LP token into the said protocol and earn volatility fees, where traders can open positions. LPs are incentivized to provide liquidity because they get bonus yield, which is more than they would've gotten otherwise. One of the core issues with LPs in AMM are they are not paid high enough in fees to compensate for risk. Lastly, profitable traders can exercise their position in profit or continue to pay the LPs a funding rate to keep the trade open perpetually.\n\nPerpetual Future Mechanism Design\n\nFor Perpetual platforms like limitless or InfinityPools, the mechanism is similar to Perpetual-options. However, users can deposit collateral, which will be combined with borrowed LP. Depending on the distance from the spot price determines the required collateral and leverage. Similar to the Perpetual options products, if a trader borrows an LP token below the range they can sell for one of the underlying tokens, creating a directional leveraged bet. The design mechanism is very similar to the prior example, the major contrast is the users deposit collateral, which is used to cover the max loss of a trade moving in the opposite direction. Both limitless and InfinityPools boast potential hundreds to thousands of X-leverage again determined by the distance from the range to the current price. If traders lose on a trade instead of being liquidated, the protocol closes their position and pays the collateral back to the LP to make the Perp sellers LP position whole. \n\nMarket Opportunity - Crypto Trading Derivatives\nTradFi Market Size \n\nThe U.S. equity markets dominate globally, accounting for over 42.5% of the $108.6 trillion global equity market cap in 2023, translating to a massive $44 trillion, as per Sifma Asset Management.\n\nTradFi Derivatives Landscape\n\nThe derivatives market is estimated to exceed $1 quadrillion in notional value at its upper end, though some argue this valuation might be inflated as per Investopedia. This astronomical figure, on the higher side, incorporates the notional value of all derivative contracts.\n\nA significant disparity exists between the notional value and the actual netted value of derivatives, with the numbers being $600 trillion and $12.4 trillion, respectively, as of 2021.\n\nDerivative trading in traditional finance is magnitudes larger than spot trading. This is the same in crypto, but the majority of volume is on CEXs. \n\nBitmex, another CEX, changed the crypto trading landscape in 2016 when they launched their Perpetual (Perp) trading instrument, the Perpetual XBTUSD Leveraged Swap. Their new product allowed users to trade Bitcoin (XBTUSD) with up to 100x leverage. The contract doesn’t expire; longs pay shorts, and vice versa. As the largest traded instrument in crypto, this product expanded from just centralized exchanges and exists in various decentralized versions: DYDX, GMX, Synthetix, and others. Perp protocols facilitate hundreds of millions in trading volume per day and are the primary derivative trading product in crypto today since they offer high leverage. This is a vast shift from traditional finance, where options dominate the derivatives landscape.\n\nCrypto Spot Vs Perps \n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the crypto market witnessed a significant dominance of derivatives, accounting for 74.8% of the total trading volume of $2.95 trillion. Centralized crypto exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) spot trading trailed behind with 22.8% and 2.4% market shares, respectively. Notably, centralized crypto derivative exchanges like Binance, Upbit, and OKX led the market. While derivatives volume saw a remarkable quarter-on-quarter growth of 34.1%, spot CEX and DEX recorded growth rates of 16.9% and 33.4%, respectively, per Coingecko 2023 Crypto Derivatives report.\n\nAs of July/2023 PREP, 74% of all crypto trading volume in July was via leverage.\n\n (Figure below)\n\nInnovative volatility trading platforms like Panoptic, Infinity Pools, Smilee, and others push the needle by providing oracle-free, liquidation-free, and even, in some cases, offer significant leverage. Powered by concentrated liquidity, AMM LP trading products remove some prominent weaknesses like managing oracles and liquidations.\n\nRisks\n\nAs exciting as these products may be, risks still come into play. The most notable is smart contract risk. Since all the AMM-LP powered trading products control the LP token or require deposits, there's possible smart contract risk if there is an exploit or bug.\n\nCredit liquidity Risk\n\nAdditionally, the economic design mechanisms are not without concerns. The Gammaswap team has interrogated the feasibility of developing on Uniswap v3 and CLAMMs due to what they define as \"credit liquidity risk.\" This risk pertains to the possibility of Liquidity Providers (LPs) being unable to pay out long positions or vice versa, often due to over-leverage in the form of liquidation issues. Since concentrated liquidity, Automated Market Makers (AMMs) like Uniswap have areas or \"ticks\" with low liquidity, prices moving out of range could cause excessive slippage, even for stable pairs. Gammaswap is opting to build on the constant function model, viewing it as a more robust liquidity primitive.\n\nWith Uniswap v3, there may not be enough liquidity to fulfill the gains made by LPs. Unlike traditional finance, where the Federal Reserve can step in to inject liquidity, there is no analogous entity in the DeFi space. Furthermore, the absence of oracles, which are traditionally used for liquidations, adds to the complexity of this issue.\n\nPanoptic addresses the credit liquidity risk issue by requiring pool creators to deposit a small amount of both tokens at full range, which panoptic traders cannot remove. The initial deposit ensures there's some liquidity across all prices.\n\nComplexity and User Adoption\n\nPerpetual Futures (Perps) have proven to be much simpler for crypto investors to understand. They operate through two mechanics: long and short positions, which traders can open with a simple click of a button. In contrast, with Options and potentially Perpetual Options, the additional complexity introduced by factors such as Greeks, strike prices, and other traditional option knowledge may hinder user adoption. This is particularly likely among retail investors, who are often the first to adopt new trading instruments. Moreover, introducing volatility trading adds even more complexity to the user experience. Since the crypto space already faces challenges with user adoption, some of these robust but complex products could encounter difficulties gaining traction due to their financial intricacy.\n\nConclusion\n\nPerpetuals and Options have found a niche within the crypto space, but it's only a matter of time before they scale into the fully-fledged products that traders and LPs are seeking.\n\nOver the next few months, many of the protocols mentioned will be launching new trading instrument betas, as well as live products. The next level of improvement in on-chain derivatives, including Perpetuals and options, will be the introduction of the ability to go long (or short) on any asset with leverage. The \"where can I long PEPE\" question will be answered in the form of leveraged liquid trading avenues for mid to long-tail assets.\n\nAMM-powered trading products are paving the way for a new paradigm of trading and could potentially enable new DeFi primitives that power other protocols. This includes options, Perpetual contracts, volatility trading, and other leverage-based products. The new wave of trading will offer an enhanced experience that could even rival the current incumbents in the market.\n\nSources \n\nPanoptic CLMMs option payoffs\n\nUniswap: A Good Deal for Liquidity Providers?\n\nCrypto Derivatives Market Size 2023 | CoinGecko\n\nAnnouncing the Launch of the Perpetual XBTUSD Leveraged Swap | BitMEX Blog\n\nResearch Quarterly: Equities - SIFMA\n\nWhat are DEFI Primitives & Where DEFI Primitives are used in Financial services | Binocs\n\nSpot Market: Definition, How They Work, and Example\n\nCash Market: Definition Vs.

Since their inception, AMMs have facilitated trading volumes exceeding trillions of dollars. Although AMMs have managed to bootstrap enough liquidity to facilitate the aforementioned trading volume, there has always been a looming threat to the sustainability of AMMs over the long term and, thus, decentralized finance as a whole. Despite the idea that LPs should profit from participating in DeFi, the benefits (i.e., trading fees) are outweighed by the costs (i.e., impermanent loss) for some LPs. Impermanent loss (IL) is the lost opportunity to provide liquidity as opposed to holding assets outright instead of providing liquidity. IL occurs when the prices of the pooled tokens (LP tokens deposited) change.\n\nUniswap: A Good Deal for Liquidity Providers?\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nSubscribe\n\nFortunately, the world of DeFi is characterized by its fast pace, constant evolution, and protocols that aim to confront the global accessibility of financial products. In this report, we will explore the fundamental AMM designs of Ambient - the original singleton AMM built directly on Ethereum's network. We aim to shed light on the most captivating features we have encountered and how they ultimately support the sustainability and broader adoption of DeFi. So, let's dive in and begin our exploration without further ado.\n\nDefying Layer-1 Limitations\n\nLet's face it - AMMs and DEXs exclusively built on Ethereum face significant headwinds due to relatively high gas fees on the layer-1 network. This drives the majority of 'modern' DeFi protocols to launch with support for various layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum. Ambient has defied this trend and opted to initially support transactions on the Ethereum network only. \n\nDespite Ethereum's network congestion obstacles, Ambient has achieved notable success across various metrics, especially since the start of summer 2023. Between early June and late July, Ambient's TVL increased approximately thirteenfold—volume on Ambient paints a similar story of success. On June 13th, Ambient hosted roughly $36,000 in volume. By July 14th, Ambient reached its highest daily volume of $1,410,000.\n\nWhile Ambient offers traders a handful of notable features, including the ability to place limit orders and pay gas fees in any ERC-20 token, if you're wondering what propelled the success of Ambient – it is largely attributable to its singleton AMM model. Let's look at Ambient's structure and how it offers incremental innovation for LPs and traders alike.\n\nThe Original Singleton AMM\n\nAmbient, previously known as CrocSwap, is a decentralized transaction protocol that enables a unique kind of automated market maker. Ambient is a singleton AMM, meaning it operates within a single smart contract, making swaps more efficient. The use of a single, smart contract results in one enormous benefit to traders and, ultimately, LPs - a significant reduction in gas fees involved with multi-hop swaps.\n\nFor context, when using an AMM, trades are executed using one of two swap types: a single-hop swap and a multi-hop swap. A single hop swap is a simple trade route that involves a direct swap of token A to token B through a single pool. On the other hand, a multi-hop swap requires a trade to be routed across multiple pools. Multi-hop swaps are only executed in the event that a single-hop swap cannot be used to fill the order, as single-hop swaps incur far fewer gas fees. Most AMMs are structured in a manner where every pool has its own smart contract, which makes the execution of multi-hop swaps across multiple pools quite expensive in terms of gas fees.\n\nSince Ambient is a singleton AMM, every pool operates within a single smart contract, which allows it to execute multi-hop swaps far more efficiently than traditional AMMs. Ambient does not transfer any intermediate tokens involved in multi-hop swaps, which significantly lowers gas used in the process of executing trades compared to other AMMs. In theory, as gas fees required to execute a trade lowers for traders, the sheer number of trades across the AMM should increase. This results in more trading fees that are distributed to LPs. Lower gas fees are especially attractive for sophisticated arbitrageurs, as prices are maintained through arbitrage trading activity. Ultimately, traders enjoy lower gas fees and efficiently priced markets, and LPs benefit from trading fees due to an overall increase in trading activity.  \n\nThe singleton model has now been adopted by the likes of Uniswap, which recently introduced a similar model in the Uniswap v4 papers. Further confirmation Ambient is on the right track pushing innovative design mechanisms to the AMM space. \n\nAmbient’s Liquidity Pools\n\nAmbient is at the forefront of optimizing the experience for liquidity providers (LPs). Since the start of DeFi and even now, impermanent loss is a constant burden for LPs. In order to eliminate the headaches LPs faced in the past, Ambient supports two types of LP positions; Ambient liquidity and concentrated liquidity. By leveraging two types of LP product offerings, Ambient upgrades liquidity provision for seasoned LPs while also onboarding a new cohort of DeFi participants through an optimal LP experience.\n\nUsers who want to customize how and when their capital is used can choose concentrated liquidity. The LP specifies the price range that determines when their liquidity is provided to liquidity pools, meaning the LP only accrues fees generated from trading pairs when the underlying assets' prices are within the specified price range. When the underlying assets' prices are outside the range, the liquidity is not active within the pool, and the LP stops receiving a portion of trading fees.\n\nConcentrated Liquidity Shape\n\nSource\n\nConcentrated liquidity caters to more sophisticated LPs as it requires more DeFi knowledge and experience and is generally the most capital-efficient LP position type supported by Ambient. Ambient liquidity is the other type of LP position supported by Ambient, which caters to all DeFi users as it does not involve specifying a price range, and is better for illiquid assets. Ambient mode uses the constant product, where liquidity is active across all prices of the underlying assets in the liquidity pool.\n\nConstant Product Liquidity Shape\n\nsource\n\nRegardless of which liquidity position type an Ambient LP decides to use, all Ambient LPs benefit from the protocol's use of smart contracts known as 'hooks.' Hooks allow Ambient to continually modify existing liquidity pool parameters, including liquidity fees. Hooks are especially interesting to LPs because they ensure they can maximize capital efficiency and automatically receive the optimal fee tier. For Ambient, liquidity fees are adjusted dynamically in response to market activity.\n\nConcentrated and constant product liquidity are not without their flaws. Traders could suffer significant slippage (price impact) if asset prices move out of supported concentrated liquidity ranges. On the flip side, constant product liquidity is spread thin across all prices which is good for traders, however LPs don’t benefit from enhanced capital efficiency by selecting a specific price range. Ambient interrogates these two design mechanisms and combines both pools under the singleton contract. Combining both liquidity strategies allows LPs to maintain capital efficiency while traders maintain cheaper swaps, and deeper liquidity. In addition, the combined model eliminates liquidity fragmentation across pools.\n\nLimit Orders\n\nAmbient offers limit orders on supported assets for traders, known as Knockout Positions, which are possible using directional concentrated liquidity. Directional, meaning when liquidity is added to a specific range, it is locked once the price crosses the range. Most AMMs are bi-directional, which swap back and forth between assets whenever the LP is within range. With directional Knockout Positions, the position gets removed once the price crosses the concentrated liquidity range the user provides. The action of removing liquidity once crossed serves as a limit order. The range for the knockout LP is tight to ensure it is filled. Keep in mind that although the range's width is tight, the liquidity is only \"knocked out\" when it is crossed fully.\n\nGasless Transactions\n\nAmbient employs account abstraction for managing gasless transactions. Account abstraction enables a third party to pay the gas fees. In this case, Ambient uses signatures to enable swaps where users only pay in the swap currency. Tips can be given to the third party as payment for sending ETH to facilitate the gasless swap on the user's behalf.\n\nDynamic Fees\n\nA fee is tied directly to the pool across other major pools like USDC/ETH on Uniswap. Uniswap employs three pricing tiers, 0.05%, 0.30%, and 1%, on Uniswap v3, which the LP selects typically based on implied volatility (expected price changes). The fees compensate LPs for taking IL (impermanent loss). On Ambient, fees are dynamically adjusted based on market volatility (market changes). Dynamic fees enable greater capital efficiency for LP, which lower active LP management and removal to meet the desired fee tiers during market lulls or extreme volatility.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile Ambient was designed to solve major problems facing LPs, the singleton AMM has struck a seemingly perfect balance between catering to LPs and enhancing the trader experience.

    "content": "Discover more from Shoal Research\nCrypto Research and Insights\nOver 1,000 subscribers\nBy subscribing, I agree to Substack's Terms of Use, and acknowledge its Information Collection Notice and Privacy Policy.\nSubscribe\nContinue reading\nSign in\nBeat the Case: The Significance of the XRP Case Ruling\nBroader implications of the partial judgement ruling in SEC vs. Ripple case.\nJUL 24, 2023\n1\nShare\n\nThe XRP case is a groundbreaking ruling for Ripple and crypto as a whole. In 2020, the SEC sued Ripple over the launch and sale of the digital asset XRP. On the other end of the spectrum, Ripple and its steadfast community maintained that it was not a security. Crypto veterans recall that XRP was one of the largest traded assets during the bull run of 2017 and continued to attract a loyal and somewhat cult-like community.\n\nFast-forward to 2023, XRP, in a groundbreaking victory, was deemed not a security. The ruling is a monumental shift for the digital asset and the crypto world at large, as it could set a precedent in case law. Furthermore, it signals a progressive shift in societal sentiment regarding the United States' perception of crypto.\n\nPage 15: \"XRP, as a digital token, is not in and of itself a “contract, transaction[,] or scheme” that embodies the Howey requirements of an investment contract.\" - (SEC v. RIPPLE LABS, 2023)\n\nPage 25 : \"Ripple’s Programmatic Sales of XRP [on digital asset exchanges] did not constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts.\" - (SEC v. RIPPLE LABS, 2023)\n\nAlthough the crypto space sees this as a huge win, the SEC did decide in a partial judgment that selling XRP to institutions was in fact a security contract. \n\nThe results of the case are important for a few reasons: \n\nSignal to Project Teams leaving the US\n\nUnited States incorporation is typically a point of contention for well-capitalized crypto project teams, where many teams decided to avoid the US in some capacity. Often incorporating semi-complex legal structures involving offshore entities or strict terms of service (TOS). These are not showy super coders or hedge funds holding funds offshore but teams aiming to limit their liability in a country without clear regulatory clarity towards crypto. Due to intense regulatory scrutiny, the United States has become a volatile place to launch digital assets. The SEC has picked off and sued multiple smaller crypto companies in the last year alone.\n\nThe ruling in the SEC vs. Ripple case signals to project teams that case law could potentially side with them in the event of a lawsuit. Although there are few projects as well capitalized as Ripple, it still sends a soft signal across the crypto space that they do have grounds to participate and build in the US. There still is a long way to go on this front, but a larger sentiment shift could be sooner than expected among project teams.\n\nIncreased Regulatory Comfort around ETH \n\nETH has been in the regulatory crosshairs recently since the SEC mentioned BTC is the only asset that is not a security. The case ruling could shed some light on what is a security and what is not, including Ethereum, which had an ICO bootstrapping event at its inception. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler postures around the \"come register\" narrative, which offers little feasibility for project teams. They also preach to politicians and other regulators, mainly those not native to crypto, which have adopted and propagated the \"come register\" notion, painting an anti-compliance narrative to the general public. Paradigm delves deeply into this in their three-part research papers.\n\nXRP is not a security \n\nIt goes without saying that XRP, not being a security, is great for their ecosystem. Within the same day of the court filing multiple crypto exchanges that previously suspended trading, including Coinbase, reenabled trading. \n\nNature is healing \n\nIt is not over yet \n\nAmidst all the excitement, virtual hugs, and bullish tweets, we are still not quite in the clear. The case resulted in a partial judgment, meaning an appeal could lead to a reversal. In fact, the SEC is already signalling that they will appeal.\n\n“While persuasive, it's not binding precedent on other courts and will likely be appealed and could be reversed” - Crypto Lawyer, Stephen Palley\n\nIn addition, Ripple is a highly capitalized firm. In other cases, project teams have often settled and chosen to wind down to avoid costly and lengthy legal processes. Hopefully, a few more large big wins like Ripple can establish a basis for small projects in the future.\n\nConclusion \n\nLast week was a great day in the crypto space, as some confidence was restored in the long-term feasibility of crypto sticking around for the long haul. With the case's conclusion, the United States has softly signaled that there is room for digital assets. At the same time, crypto project teams, investors, and users still need to keep a keen eye on the following stages of crypto regulation within the United States. Although countries have separate crypto jurisdictions, the United States plays a huge role in global shaping policy.\n\nNot financial or tax advice. The purpose of this newsletter is purely educational and should not be considered as investment advice, legal advice, a request to buy or sell any assets, or a suggestion to make any financial decisions.

Uniswap, with its Automated Market Maker (AMM) design, initiated a significant shift by enabling traders to swap assets permissionlessly, even in low-liquidity markets. AMMs create a two-sided market consisting of liquidity providers and traders. While these innovations have been groundbreaking, both traders and liquidity providers (LPs) alike still express disdain regarding fees and flexibility around the platform - intro Maverick protocol.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

The DAMM design improves the AMM experience for both liquidity providers (LPs) and traders by lowering slippage for traders and adding enhanced LP strategies. The protocol also focuses heavily on liquid staking token (LST) trading, eliminating major slippage trading amongst ETH LST pairs. \n\nOperating on both Ethereum and zkSync Era, Maverick's design also aims to improve capital efficiency and reduce impermanent losses for both liquidity providers and traders. One of the key features of Maverick is its built-in automatic rebalancing, which eliminates the need for users to spend significantly to move their liquidity position back into range so it continues to earn fees. Currently, on Uniswap V3, users can specify a price range in which their money is at work. When the price moves out of this range, their capital becomes idle, which forces them to spend gas to rebalance their capital to meet their strategy, given changes in market conditions and price. Dynamic rebalancing significantly enhances the user experience by providing superior capital efficiency and lowering the cost to service the LP.\n\nCapital efficiency: “Effective utilization of resources to generate maximum output or returns. Prevention of idle money.”  - Shoal Research\n\nBefore we delve deeper into the Maverick Protocol, it's essential to understand how an AMM works.\n\nAutomated Market Makers (AMM)\n\nAutomated Market Maker (AMM) is a term used in decentralized finance to describe a protocol that facilitates the trading of digital assets without relying on traditional order books. Instead, AMMs use mathematical algorithms to determine the prices of the assets being traded automatically.\n\nOn a conventional exchange, buyers and sellers place orders in an order book, and the exchange matches these orders to facilitate trades. However, in an AMM-based decentralized exchange, there are liquidity pools. Liquidity pools are collections of funds that users deposit to fulfill trades. Liquidity providers (LPs) get incentives, fees, and rewards for providing liquidity.\n\nAMMs enable instant, permissionless trading and are fundamental to the functioning of decentralized exchanges. Unlike traditional exchanges, non-institutional users can take on the role of market makers by adding liquidity in exchange for fees. However, providing liquidity in an AMM can come with risks such as impermanent loss, which occurs when the prices of assets in a pool change compared to when they were deposited. Impermanent loss can also be described as the missed opportunity cost of potential value when providing liquidity versus holding the assets outright.\n\nAMM iterations on Uniswap\nMaverick AMM\n\nMaverick's Automated Market Maker (AMM) design differs greatly from other AMMs. Maverick is centered around optimizing capital efficiency and providing flexibility for Liquidity Providers (LPs). The protocol segments liquidity into different pills called Bins, which aim to improve capital efficiency. Here's an overview of its design:\n\nBins\n\nMaverick employs bins,\" representing a specific price range within the liquidity pool. This segmentation allows Liquidity Providers (LPs) to allocate their assets to specific price ranges, optimizing capital allocation based on market conditions. In other AMM designs, like Uniswap v2, liquidity providers provide liquidity across an infinite price range. With Mavericks bins, LPs can ensure they only provide liquidity at specific prices and/or abide by the liquidity provision rebalancing strategy.\n\nSegmented Liquidity Pools\n\nTo better understand Mavericks Bin's liquidity design, Imagine you're at a fruit market and want to sell apples. Instead of setting one price for all apples, you create different buckets where each bucket has a price range. For example, one bucket for really cheap apples, one for moderately priced apples, and one for expensive apples in Maverick's AMM; these buckets are called \"bins,\" and they let you specify the price point you want to provide inventory to the market. Depending on the price of the apples, buyers will only pull from the bucket at the current market price. If you want to sell your apples, you have to provide liquidity within the current price range, or wait until the price reaches your bucket. Depending on the LPs strategy they might chose to provide liquidity at certain price ranges below, at, or above the current price.\n\nUniswap v2 is akin to allowing people to buy your apples at any price, depending on the overall market price. By using bins, LPs also have a tighter grasp on their capital risk controls, potentially limiting impermanent loss, and maximizing fees.\n\nBoosted Pools\n\nWith incentivized pools, custom liquidity shaping (LP strategies), custom fee tiers, and directional liquidity provision, Maverick creates increased tooling for LPs to participate in the market. In addition, Maverick supports liquidity mining solutions where protocols can permissionlessly incentivize liquidity via \"boosted pools.\" Boosting pools draws more liquidity to the pool as LPs will make more yield from increased reward incentives. Protocols are incentivized to boost their pools to ensure users can seamlessly swap between assets without significant price impact. With deeper liquidity comes a lower price impact. Furthermore, Maverick's modes offer different options for liquidity provision, allowing users to tailor their approach based on their preferences. Maverick further amplifies yield by automatically reinvesting trading fees back into the liquidity provider's position.\n\nMaverick Modes\n\nMaverick's Automated Market Maker (AMM) design offers four distinct modes for liquidity providers (LPs) to optimize strategies based on market conditions labeled Mode Static, Mode Right, Mode Left, and Mode Both. Each mode presents characteristics that tailor LP strategies for maximum fee generation; let's cover them one by one below:\n\nMode Static\n\nMode Static is the conventional mode and resembles the functionality of existing AMMs. It does not employ automated liquidity shifting. In this mode, LPs have the liberty to deploy liquidity with three default configurations:\n\nExponential: “Gradual Spread”: most of the liquidity is bunched up close to the current pool price, and the rest is spread out across nearby price range bins, decreasing bit by bit.\n\nFlat: “Even Spread”: liquidity is spread out evenly across different price ranges, centered on the current pool price, similar to how Uniswap v2 works.\n\nSingle Bin: “Single Spot Focus” means all the liquidity is put into one spot, the active price range. The Single Bin is like putting all your eggs in one basket, similar to Uniswap v3.\n\nMode Right\n\nMode Right operates as a dynamic range order that tracks the price in an upward direction. It is particularly beneficial for LPs looking to capitalize on the positive price action of the base asset. In this mode, liquidity is kept in a bin of the quote asset just to the left of the price as it ascends, poised to capture fees whenever the price falls within the range. Essentially, Mode Right is tailored for scenarios where the LP anticipates an upward price trajectory.\n\nTrading Pair Example: ETH/USDC\n\nBase Asset: Or basis, is the asset to be purchased or sold, ex. $ETH\n\nQuote asset: the payment asset for the base asset, ex. $USDC\n\nMode right in practice: Imagine you have two assets, A and B. If the price of asset A starts to rise, Mode Right ensures that your liquidity is concentrated just below the current price. This allows you to earn fees when the price dips slightly. It's like riding the wave of an asset's price as it goes up.\n\nMode Left\n\nMode Left is essentially the inverse of Mode Right. It continuously shifts liquidity to the right of the current active bin when the base asset is trending downward. This mode is advantageous for LPs who anticipate a decline in the price of the base asset. In Mode Left, an LP aims to maintain a bin of base assets directly to the right of the price as it moves left in the pool, ready to match orders once the price rebounds.\n\nMode Left in Practice: If the price of asset A starts to fall, Mode Left ensures that your liquidity is concentrated just above the current price. This allows you to earn fees when the price slightly rises before continuing its downward trend.\n\nMode Both\n\nMode Both is the all-around Mode that enables liquidity to adapt to price movements dynamically, be they upward or downward. LPs have the option to allocate liquidity to the currently active price range as well as the ones immediately next to it. As the price sways in any direction, Mode Both smartly repositions the liquidity to keep it centered around the current price. This Mode is somewhat like having an auto-adjusting focus in a camera that keeps the subject sharp regardless of movements. However, it's crucial to be mindful that Mode Both comes with increased susceptibility to impermanent loss, particularly in markets that have a lot of price fluctuations.\n\nIncentives \n\nMaverick's incentive structure is designed to reward liquidity providers (LPs) based on their market prediction, participation,, and risk tolerance. \n\nPredicting Price Movements: Maverick's Mode Left or Mode Right allows LPs to automatically adjust their liquidity to follow the price movement, keeping their capital active and efficient.\n\nStable Price Expectations: Mode Both are ideal for LPs who expect minor price fluctuations, allowing them to keep their liquidity active and collect as many fees as possible.\n\nExponential Distributions: In Mode Static, LPs can place most of their liquidity at the current price, spreading the rest across surrounding price ranges and balancing liquidity concentration and risk.\n\nA few more strategies and ways to earn fees and maximize returns from Maverick are:\n\nLimit order strategies\n\nDollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategies\n\nBuy-Sell Ramp\n\nEven Distribution\n\nStake to earn\n\nMaverick’s Go-to-Market Approach\n\nMaverick has adopted a distinctive approach for its go-to-market strategy. Instead of solely launching on Ethereum, the protocol is a pioneer in the zkSync Era. This multi-platform approach allows Maverick to take advantage of each platform's unique features and benefits, providing a more robust and versatile service to its users. The zkSync Era officially launched in March, and while the ecosystem is still in its early stages, there has been a steady increase in volume. Furthermore, Maverick's DEX volume continues to climb, securing a position among the top 500 DEX platforms. Currently, it stands at number 5 among Ethereum DEXs. In comparison, Uniswap, a prominent player in the space, boasts a volume of over 700 million and ranks number one on the Ethereum chain. Maverick also chose to launch their token on Binance launchpad which has a considerable list of successful projects. By launching on Binance they were able to bootstrap initial token liquidity and holder diversification.\n\nExamining the Metrics\n\nMaverick is not only excelling in terms of volume but also fee generation. The platform has consistently set new all-time highs in volume since its launch, with an ATH of $20,000 on June 1st and currently reaching over $13,000. This growth can be attributed to users' ongoing migration to new DEXs, driven by the desire for improved incentives and diversified risk exposure. \n\nMavericks Total Value Locked (TVL) is also pushing all-time highs on the Ethereum chain, currently at $35 million. In addition, it has marked a TVL of roughly $7 million on zkSync Era. This substantial TVL, mirroring the trading volume, signifies the robust growth and deepening trust in the Maverick protocol.\n\nCurrently, the majority of pools on Maverick are utilized by users who are primarily focused on stablecoins and LSTs, which both typically have lower price deviation. With the inclusion of stablecoins and liquid staking assets, trading volume typically comes from the WETH/wstETH and USDC/UST pools.\n\nIt is worth noting that users may require some time to familiarize themselves with the AMM (Automated Market Maker) and Maverick's liquidity strategies, which may impact the pace of adoption and utilization. AMM complexity for liquidity provision is not a new issue. Many users voiced concerns about Uniswp v3's design complexity for users. Given general LP complexity, Mavericks volume metrics are impressive.\n\nWhile many Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) typically employ attractive reward strategies like yield farming or liquidity incentives to draw user traffic and boost trading volume, Maverick emphasizes low-slippage trading. This unique strategy is gradually earning Maverick recognition among other market entrants.\n\nFrom its inception, Maverick has shown a propensity to be favorable towards large-scale investors, often referred to as 'whales.' Analysis of the trade data reveals that the majority of trades are above $100k, placing them at the top of the transaction size spectrum. This is followed by smaller trades and retail activity. On the Ethereum mainnet, a significant portion of Maverick's trading volume, over 75%, is derived from transactions exceeding $10,100, with very few transactions happening below this threshold.\n\nInfluence on LSTs\n\nLST's protocols are attracting increasing attention, and their narrative is growing stronger daily. The narrative surrounding LST is anticipated to gain momentum in the coming months and extend into the next year, solidifying its position as a potential leader in AMM and CDP-based protocols. While several DEXs are already consuming LST and CDP volumes, Maverick currently captures approximately 24% of the LST volume compared to other top venues. Nevertheless, the path ahead will undoubtedly be challenging as competition intensifies.\n\nLST Trading Volume\n\nMaverick has quickly established itself as a formidable competitor, currently holding a 26% market share volume, in the last 30, on par with Uniswap. This achievement is particularly impressive considering Maverick's relatively recent launch. The rapid growth and strong metrics exhibited by Maverick within a short time is remarkable.\n\nDex Trading Volume\n\nConsidering the global view of DEX trading volume over the past 30 days, Maverick currently represents only around 2% of the total DEX volume. Notably, a significant portion of this 2% is attributed to the LST volume.\n\nDEX Aggregator Routing\n\nOne of the most interesting metrics around Maverick is 99% of transaction volume comes from DEX aggregators. DEX aggregators sit on top of AMMs and route customer trades to the most efficient swap destination. Since Maverick is highly capital efficient, large swaps for LSTs and stablecoins often route to Maverick from services like 1inch, Cowswap, Metamask, and others.\n\nMaverick's volume origination highlights DeFi compatibility, which refers to decentralized applications (Dapps) as building blocks that can be replicated or built on top of. In the case of Maverick, the underlying architecture speaks for itself, and trade aggregators automatically route transactions to the platform.\n\nMarket Competition\n\nTrader Joe's was one of the first DEXs, to utilize liquidity bins. Many market participants often draw comparisons between Trader Joe's and Maverick's design implementations due to the similarities in architecture. \n\nDifferentiating from Trader Joe, Mavericks provides various modes or strategies for liquidity management based on directional bets. These modes enable the dynamic adjustment of liquidity in response to price fluctuations.\n\nChallenging the AMM King, Uniswap\n\nThe primary challenge for most newly launched decentralized exchanges (DEXs) is attracting user traffic and volume from established DEXs like Uniswap and Curve. Many of these new protocols initially succeed in attracting a user base. Still, users often revert to the more prominent players when the new projects fail to deliver on their initial promises or user incentives dry up.\n\nDespite the launch of Uniswap v3 and anticipated v4, Maverick stands out due to its ability to provide efficient incentives and liquidity strategies for protocols and users. Its unique features make it attractive for both LPs and traders alike. We are already seeing early signs of success from DEX aggregator order routing.\n\nConclusion\n\nMaverick Protocol is a novel entrant in the DeFi sector, where most AMM implementations are forks of existing systems, introducing unique liquidity provision strategies that enhance trading efficiency. Despite the dominance of established DEXs, Maverick has shown promising growth due to its increased capital efficiency. Its recent launch on Ethereum and zkSync is a testament to its work-based design with strong fundamentals and growth metrics. As LPs and traders continue to seek better LP solutions and AMMs with high incentives, low fees, and minimal slippage, we believe Maverick could become one of the go-to platforms.\n\nSources \n\nIntroducing Maverick: A Protocol for Decentralized Permissionless Trading and Staking of Any Asset\n\nMaverick Official Website\n\nUnderstanding Modes - Maverick Docs\n\nLiquidity Strategies - Maverick Docs\n\nThe Basics of Liquidity Providers - Maverick Docs\n\nMaverick Protocol - Dune Analytics\n\nLST Wars ⚔\n\nMaverick Procotol - AMM for every market condition\n\nNot financial or tax advice. The purpose of this newsletter is purely educational and should not be considered as investment advice, a request to buy or sell any assets, or a suggestion to make any financial decisions.

Uniswap v1 allowed users to swap ETH to ERC-20 tokens, while v2 allowed users to trade ERC20 tokens with other ERC20s. V2 also added a wide range of assets that were not yet available on any other exchanges, all using a constant product market maker (CPMM) model. The constant product market-making model, X*Y=K, allows users to trade with a pool of tokens rather than with direct peers or market makers. The revolutionary Uniswap v3 allowed liquidity providers the freedom to concentrate their liquidy range in a liquidity position (LP), which improved capital efficiency but added complexity and increased gas costs for users.\n\nCapital efficiency: “Effective utilization of resources to generate maximum output or returns. Prevention of idle money.”  - Shoal Research \n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

With the upcoming release of Uniswap v4, the protocol is set to introduce even greater customization and flexibility through hooks, further solidifying its position as a leading decentralized exchange platform. This article explores the features and enhancements of Uniswap v4. Let's walk through the v4's architecture and uncover how they plan to improve the DEX landscape. \n\nUniswap v3, Concentrated Liquidity\n\nBefore diving into the specifics of v4, it is crucial to understand Uniswap v3, a landmark development in the AMM landscape. V3 introduced concentrated liquidity, an innovation that allows liquidity providers to designate specific price ranges for their capital. By providing specific price ranges for liquidity, LPs can earn greater fees boosting capital efficiency. Uniswap v2 is based on the constant product formula X*Y=K, which at the time was novel because it created markets for illiquid assets. However, has reduced capital efficiency since liquidity was spread infinitely along the liquidity curve. Meaning whenever an LP provided liquidity, they supported all asset prices. \n\nWith the advent of v3, users were given more autonomy to specify fee tiers and even liquidity ranges, leading to higher capital efficiency and deeper liquidity.  \n\nUniswap v4, AMM Marketplace\n\nTaking v3 a step further, Uniswap v4 introduces new customization through the Singleton contract and hooks, which we will detail shortly. These innovative solutions aim to streamline on-chain computations, reducing costs and some complexities while offering more capital efficiency and flexibility with protocol designs built on Uniwap. Before v4, Uniswap v3 assigned core immutable parameters that the core team calls \"opinions,\" such as fee tier and other predefined structures, meaning the Uniswap team came up with immutable features for v3 that are now customizable in v4. With v4, developers can become \"expressive\" about the liquidity pool parameters, which is expected to lead to extensive financial primitives on top of the Uniswap liquidity layer.  \n\nLiquidity Platform\n\nLack of liquidity is one of the core issues in the DeFi space, as protocols need substantial liquidity to perform extensive DeFi operations. Uniswap v4 aims to serve as the liquidity layer for many of these protocols. \n\nThink of Uniswap v4 with regard to the iPhone ecosystem. Apps like Telegram, Twitter, and Instagram are developed and deployed to the Apple App Store, reaching an extensive user base. Similarly, liquidity management protocols, DEXs, and other Dapps can tap into Uniswap V4 to utilize its liquidity through hooks. Just as users visit the App Store to obtain desired apps, users can turn to protocols built on Uniswap V4 to access the specific liquidity strategies and other tools they desire.\n\nBy leveraging a platform-based approach, Uniswap v4 can benefit from network effects by other protocols developing on its liquidity layer. Network effects are a phenomenon particularly observable in social media, which refers to the exponential growth of products as they accumulate more users, eventually leading to a dominant market position.\n\nWhat exactly is the Singleton contract? \n\nThe singleton contract structure is an innovative feature of Uniswap v4 that consolidates multiple token pool contracts into one overarching contract. In the example below, for an ETH/DAI swap, the trade routes between multiple trading pair pools to reach the desired outcome. With the singleton contract, the trade is routed through one contract full of many trading pairs. Instead of moving tokens between pools, the contract does balance accounting similar to swaps on centralized exchanges, known as Flash accounting. \n\nFlash Accounting\n\nFlash accounting updates the internal net balance and executes external transfers only at the end of a block, reducing gas costs while simplifying complex pool operations like atomic swapping and liquidity addition. Flash accounting also enhances the efficiency of multi-hop trades, delivering cheaper costs for swapping and improved slippage on multi-hop swaps. This innovation benefits end users by making transactions more affordable and seamless.\n\nCombining the singleton contract and flash accounting, Uniswap founder Hayden Adams estimates a 99% fee reduction for deploying a new liquidity pool.\n\nIntroduction of Hooks!\n\nUniswap v4 introduces the concept of \"hooks,\" which offer developers the ability to customize liquidity pools. Hooks are externally deployed contracts that execute developer-defined logic at key moments in the pool's lifecycle, such as before, after, or during a swap. Hooks are widget-like add-ons to liquidity pools that enable increased functionality and features.\n\nThese hooks allow for custom implementations such as dynamic fees, on-chain limit orders, advanced oracles, and novel liquidity strategies, traditionally predefined by the protocol like in v3. This level of flexibility enables developers to harness and innovate on Uniswap's liquidity and security, tailoring the trading experience to their specific requirements.\n\nOne notable example is the utilization of hooks to create a time-weighted average market maker (TWAMM), which addresses the challenge of minimizing price impact when executing large orders in automated market makers (AMMs). By breaking up large orders over time, TWAMM, implemented as a hook, offers a sophisticated solution to enhance trading strategies.\n\nFragmented Liquidity \n\nExpanding on the \"opinions\" that the core Uniswap team made on Uniswap V3, protocols that wanted to modify the core parameters previously had to fork the Uniswap codebase. This often led to fragmented liquidity and increased transaction costs due to the augmented on-chain computations required, as each asset pair operated as its own contract.\n\nNow, protocols can leverage hooks, simplifying the implementation process to fit their specific criteria without needing to fork the codebase. Ultimately, hooks significantly enhance liquidity management and trading for traders and providers.\n\nHooks extended use Cases:\n\nIn addition to TWAMM, hooks unlock a multitude of possibilities for customization, such as: \n\nDynamic Fee Structures: Hooks enable the implementation of dynamic fees that can be based on various factors, such as market volatility or other user-defined inputs. This flexibility allows for fee adjustments that align with changing market conditions.\n\nOnchain Limit Orders: With hooks, users can leverage on-chain limit orders, enhancing the trading experience by enabling precise execution at predetermined price levels. This feature brings greater control and efficiency to trading on Uniswap.\n\nEnhanced Liquidity Deployment: Hooks offer the ability to deposit liquidity outside the typical price range of a pool into lending protocols. This feature expands liquidity providers' options, allowing them to optimize their capital allocation and explore additional yield-generating opportunities.\n\nCustomized Onchain Oracles: Through hooks, developers can integrate customized on-chain oracles. These oracles provide alterNative price feeds and data aggregation methods, enabling the creation of innovative trading strategies and improved accuracy in determining asset prices.\n\nAuto-compounding LP Fees: Hooks make it possible to automatically compound LP (liquidity provider) fees back into the LP positions. This feature streamlines the process of compounding earnings, optimizing returns for liquidity providers without requiring manual intervention.\n\nInternalized MEV Profit Distribution: Hooks facilitate the internalization of Miner Extractable Value (MEV) profits, ensuring that these profits are distributed back to liquidity providers. This mechanism enhances liquidity provision incentives and aligns market participants' interests.\n\nReintroduction of Native ETH Support\n\nUniswap v4 brings back support for Native ETH, which was previously removed in v2 due to implementation complexity and liquidity fragmentation. The introduction of flash accounting and the singleton contract enables the efficient handling of Native ETH by transferring assets only on net balances. This results in significant gas savings, as Native ETH transfers are approximately half the cost of ERC-20 transfers. Although the handling of Native ETH remains a challenging area, the benefits it brings in terms of reduced gas costs make it a valuable addition to Uniswap v4.  \n\nSummary and Conclusion \n\nHere is a wrap up of what Uniswap V4 is all about: \n\nUniswap v4 introduces hooks, enabling customization of liquidity pools and trading experiences.\n\nHooks allow the execution of custom code at specific points during a pool's execution.\n\nCustomizability empowers builders to create unique trading experiences and break free from predefined rules.\n\nUniswap v4 features improved gas efficiency with a singleton implementation and flash accounting.\n\nNative ETH support is reintroduced, bringing significant gas savings.\n\nHooks enable a variety of use cases, including TWAMM, dynamic fee structures, on-chain limit orders, enhanced liquidity deployment, customized on-chain oracles, auto-compounding of LP fees, and internalized distribution of MEV profits.\n\nUniswap v4 improves DEX landscape by offering greater customization and flexibility.\n\nThese new features and improvements have the potential to enhance the efficiency of Uniswap. But the added complexity may require a steep learning curve and potentially limit adoption among less tech-savvy users. It's also important to note that Uniswap v4 will not replace v2 and v3. Each version has its unique features and improves on the earlier versions. The decision to use v2, v3, or v4 will depend on a user's specific needs and understanding. Uniswap v4 represents a step forward in terms of possibilities, and it also shows the inherent trade-off between efficiency and user-friendliness in the DeFi space. It will depend on front-end implementations to see how end users can interact without deeper understanding.\n\nSources\n\nhttps://uniswap.org/faq\n\nhttps://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v4\n\nhttps://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v3\n\nhttps://blog.uniswap.org/fee-returns\n\nhttps://blog.uniswap.org/launch-uniswap-v3\n\nhttps://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-v3-math-primer\n\nhttps://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/main/whitepaper-v4-draft.pdf\n\nNot financial or tax advice. The purpose of this newsletter is purely educational and should not be considered as investment advice, a request to buy or sell any assets, or a suggestion to make any financial decisions.

Stablecoins like Tether (USDT) are incredibly useful, with daily trading volumes in the billions. However, users often depend heavily on banking infrastructure and trust in the custodian's practices is paramount. This is where stablecoins backed by crypto assets and now LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens) come in.\n\nThis research paper highlights key innovations in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, focusing on collateralized debt positions in liquid staking Defi (LSTfi). Key players within the LST-backed CDP sectors, such as crvUSD, Lybra, Raft, Gravita, and Dinero, emerge as first movers in the growing landscape, utilizing unique protocols mechanics to enable financial stability and capital efficiency within the DeFi ecosystem. This study aims to provide insights to help evaluate the potential risks and benefits associated with these rapidly evolving protocols.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research!

Two of the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are stablecoins, predominantly backed by USD or US Treasuries. Despite the large on-chain volumes commanded by USDC (USD Coin) and USDT (Tether), the market seeks alternatives, primarily due to these stablecoins' reliance on off-chain trust.\n\nDesigning a stablecoin involves a complex problem, the so-called stablecoin trilemma, which envisions an ideal stablecoin as having three core attributes: price stability, decentralization, and capital efficiency. \n\nPrice stability: Maintaining a stable peg.\n\nDecentralization: distributing powers and governance away from a central authority.\n\nCapital Efficiency: Effective utilization of resources to generate maximum output or returns. Prevention of idle money. \n\nThe leading fiat-backed stablecoins offer capital efficiency and price stability but fall short in decentralization. While these have become the default stablecoins for many market participants, due to increasing regulatory scrutiny and transparency issues, users have begun exploring diverse stablecoin models. Algorithmic stablecoins, which are capital efficient and decentralized, are one such option, although they may face a potential \"death spiral,\" as observed with Terra Luna’s UST.\n\nsource\n\nThe third architecture, crypto-backed stables, combines decentralization and price stability but falls short in capital efficiency. The permissionless nature of crypto and decentralized markets largely drive the crypto ethos. However, many market participants, especially newcomers and institutional actors, do not put decentralization high on their list of priorities. This lack of emphasis, along with first-mover advantages, fuels the explosive growth in fiat-backed stables. The early market entry of fiat-backed USDT also played a significant role in spurring the surge of fiat-backed stablecoins. Consequently, crypto-backed stablecoins have not emerged as the top preference for many.\n\nLST-backed stablecoins interrogate this trilemma in an effort to bridge all three components, creating a reliable medium of exchange. \n\nCollateralized Debt Position - CDP\n\nIn traditional finance, there exists a concept known as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). These financial instruments are essentially bundles of loans or other valuable assets that can be utilized to offset losses if a loan repayment fails. Despite their inherent risk, they are considered practical tools in the financial sector since they grant depositors a line of credit backed by their assets.\n\nWith the advent of blockchain technology, similar structures emerge without the need for banks or intermediaries. Collateralized debt positions, known as CDPs, are permissionless assets backed by on-chain deposits of other assets. Akin to digital vaults, users can deposit valuable digital assets, such as Ethereum (ETH), and in exchange, they receive another digital token, often a stablecoin like DAI. Stablecoins are useful because they are engineered to maintain a stable value close to $1, thus enabling users to have access to a less volatile asset (DAI) for payments while still maintaining exposure to the underlying asset (ETH). \n\nThere are over forty such systems, collectively valued at over $8.9 billion. The largest among these is MakerDAO, which holds more than $7.6 billion in assets.\n\nLSTfi\n\nLiquid Staking Derivatives Finance (LSTfi) comprises decentralized finance protocols that extensively utilize Liquid staking tokens (LSTs) in DeFi operations. LSTs are typically ERC-20 tokens representing a user's staked ETH, such as stETH issued by Lido. With LSTs, users can earn rewards, trade on decentralized exchanges, and utilize other DeFi services. The primary advantages of LSTfi include the capability for users to earn interest on their staked assets while maintaining access to them and the opportunity to trade staked assets without needing to unstake them. \n\nCDPs in LSTfi\n\nCurrently, there is a huge race among CDP protocols competing within LSTfi to capture TVL (total locked value). The CDP LSDfi protocols follow the same general principles where users can deposit their staked assets to mint stablecoins. In the context of LSTfi, users typically deposit a LST (stETH) to borrow a stablecoin (like R, raft stablecoin) against it (as shown in the Figure below). If the value of a user's collateral falls below a certain threshold, their assets will be liquidated (sold off) to cover the decrease in prices, resulting in the loss of their staked assets. Here are the benefits of using CDPs:\n\nEarn interest on staked assets: Users can earn interest on their staked assets by minting LSDs and using them to yield earnings on DeFi protocols.\n\nTrade-staked assets without unstaking: Users can trade staked assets without having to unstake them by using LSDs. This can benefit users who want to seize market opportunities without needing to tie up their stakes.\n\nAccess DeFi services: Users can access DeFi services, such as lending and borrowing, by using LSDs. This is useful for those who want to use their staking assets to generate income or hedge against market volatility.\n\nThe emergence of LSTfi protocols has been driven by the desire for more stable and less volatile financial instruments within the cryptocurrency market. These protocols often offer unique features and benefits, such as lower liquidation risk, and yield farming opportunities, giving market participants more utilities for assets they already own.\n\nAt the time of writing, approximately $18.34 billion is locked in liquid staking protocols, and around $9.37 billion is locked in DeFi CDP protocols. This is in comparison to the all-time high of $30.5 billion locked in CDPs during the peak of the 2021 bull market, largely driven by MakerDao.\n\nThese emerging protocols, each with unique offerings and associated projects are shaping the future of LSTfi with CDPs. Here are some of the notable ones:\n\ncrvUSD: A stablecoin that rebalances user collateral into more stable assets as the price falls, thus reducing liquidation risk.\n\nLybra: Known for eUSD, a yield-producing stablecoin.\n\nRaft: Single collateral stETH and smart liquidation through flash mints.\n\nGravita: Borrower-friendly terms and focus on censorship resistance.\n\nDinero: Upcoming LSTfi protocol that will leverage its LST for stablecoin minting  \n\ncrvUSD\n\nCrvUSD is a decentralized stablecoin launched by Curve Finance, a DeFi protocol known for optimizing swaps between identically pegged digital assets, primarily stablecoins. Users deposit collateral to take out a loan in CrvUSD. Initially, CrvUSD will likely accept ETH as collateral, similar to DAI by MakerDAO. Eventually, Liquidity Pool (LP) positions might also be accepted as collateral options. Unlike most CDPs, crvUSD automatically rebalances users' collateral into more stable assets as the price falls, which reduces liquidation risk but potentially limits upside gains.\n\nThe liquidation mechanism is possible through the lending-liquidating AMM algorithm (LLAMMA). This algorithm sets specific price bands to liquidate portions of the collateral rather than fully liquidating it at a specific price. As the price of the collateral falls, it is sold for CrvUSD. When the collateral value hits the targeted liquidation point, there will already be enough CrvUSD to cover the loan value, averting a typical liquidation scenario. Conversely, as the price of the collateral recovers, crvUSD is converted back into the posted collateral.\n\ncrvusd collateral\n\nThis mechanism of crvUSD could attract more liquidity providers to Curve's LPs, thereby achieving greater capital efficiency with their funds. Coupled with the reduced risk of liquidations thanks to LLAMMA, this could be very enticing for risk-averse users looking to incorporate elements of leverage into their DeFi strategy.\n\nLybra Protocol\n\nLybra is a DeFi protocol that introduces eUSD, the first interest-bearing stablecoin. The protocol operates on a collateralized debt position (CDP) mechanism, where users deposit ETH or STETH as collateral to mint eUSD. The stability of eUSD is maintained through a combination of over-collateralization, liquidation mechanisms, and arbitrage opportunities.\n\nLybra's unique interest-bearing stablecoin, eUSD, generates a base annual percentage yield (APY). This stable yield attracts users seeking a steady income stream while maintaining exposure to ETH staking. Furthermore, as the price of ETH increases, the yield generated by eUSD holders also rises, and conversely, it decreases in the event of a price drop.\n\nZero Minting Fees and Loan Interest\n\nLybra differentiates itself from other stablecoin protocols by offering users zero minting fees and zero loan interest. This feature allows users to leverage their ETH holdings and mint eUSD stablecoins without incurring additional costs.\n\nHow Lybra Works\n\nDeposit: Users deposit ETH or stETH as collateral.\n\nMint eUSD: Users can mint or borrow eUSD against their collateral.\n\nReceive Interest or Spend: Users can hold eUSD to receive interest APY or use it in other DeFi protocols.\n\nRaft Protocol\n\nRaft is the first US dollar stablecoin collateralized solely by Lido Staked Ether (stETH). This stablecoin is designed to retain a value of 1 USD, maintaining its peg through a combination of hard peg and soft peg mechanisms.\n\nThe launch of Raft provides a solution for Lido users seeking capital-efficient ways to use their stETH. The protocol allows depositors to generate R, a decentralized USD stablecoin, using their stETH, eliminating the need for fiat backing. On a positive note, Raft's Total Value Locked (TVL) jumped to $29 million in just three days, representing a daily increase of 15%.\n\nOne-Step Leverage\n\nOne of the unique features that Raft plans to introduce soon is one-step leverage, which enables users to trade with up to 11x leverage on stETH in a single transaction. This leverage ratio is higher than what any other platform currently offers. Moreover, Raft simplifies the complex multi-step transactions required to gain leverage on stETH through other loan platforms like Aave or Maker. This functionality utilizes Flash Mint to offer leverage on stETH.\n\nRaft Flash mints\n\nAnother unique feature of Raft is its use of flash mints rather than a stability pool for liquidation. A flash mint is a type of flash loan, a feature offered by some DeFi protocols that allow users to borrow and repay an asset within the same transaction. This can be used for various purposes, including arbitrage, collateral swapping, and self-liquidation. Using flash mints for liquidation aims to make the liquidation process faster and more efficient. However, it also introduces additional complexity and potential risks.\n\nGravita\n\nThe Gravita Protocol is a unique, Ethereum-based borrowing system offering interest-free loans using liquid staking tokens (LSTs) and a stability pool (SP) as security. Borrowers receive loans by minting GRAI, a token designed to reduce price volatility. Loans can reach up to 90% - 99% of the collateral's value, depending on the type of collateral.\n\nHere's how Gravita works:\n\nBorrow GRAI: Users open a vessel to deposit collateral. They can borrow GRAI with a maximum fee of 0.5% and enjoy 0% interest indefinitely.\n\nDeploy GRAI: 1 GRAI is equivalent to $1. Users can swap or spend it however they like or deposit it in Gravita's Stability Pool to purchase WETH and LSTs at a discount.\n\nRepay GRAI: Users can close their vessel and withdraw collateral conveniently. Repaying within 6 months grants a partial refund of the 0.5% fee.\n\nEarning Money with Gravita\n\nYou can generate income on Gravita by contributing to the stability pool, designed to repay the debts of liquidated positions that exceed the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. You can earn income from liquidation gains by participating in the stability pool. Gravita may also introduce a governance token in the future to offer additional benefits to users. At the time of writing, the total value locked in the Gravita Protocol stands at around $20.6 million, up 10% weekly since launch. The protocol continues to attract more users as the TVL continues to grow.\n\nGRAI and GRVT (soon) Tokens\n\nGRAI is an over-collateralized debt token issued by Gravita, meaning that the collateral backing it exceeds the loan's value. It is generated when assets are deposited into the Gravita Protocol. The price of GRAI is kept within a certain range through mechanisms that establish a rigid price ceiling and floor, offering arbitrage opportunities that aid in maintaining price stability. Additionally, Gravita may launch a governance token named GRVT in the future to confer extra perks to users.\n\nPros\n\nInterest-Free Loans\n\nDiverse Collateral Types\n\nEarning Opportunities\n\nNon-Custodial and Transparent: Price Stability Mechanisms\n\nRisks\n\nRisk of Asset Loss\n\nDependence on User Understanding\n\nSmart Contract Risk\n\n\nDinero Protocol\n\nThe Dinero Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project developed by the Redacted Cartel. It introduces a new permissionless stablecoin, Dinero, which is backed by user-owned block space and is designed to maintain a 1:1 value ratio with the US dollar.\n\nHere's how Dinero works:\n\nStake ETH: Users with Ether can utilize the Dinero Protocol to stake their ETH.\n\nAccess a Premium Decentralized Remote Procedure Call (RPC): This feature revolves around DINERO as a medium of exchange.\n\nETH Liquid Staking Token (LST): The protocol includes an ETH liquid staking token (LST), which benefits from staking yield, and the Dinero Protocol.\n\nStaking ETH: Empowering Users\n\nInitially, DINERO will function like a typical collateralized debt position (CDP) stablecoin, such as $DAI. However, the ultimate goal is to use the underlying $ETH collateral to enable a decentralized RPC and a block builder that protects Dinero users from MEV attacks.\n\nDecentralized RPC:\n\nDinero Protocol aims to democratize access to premium block space on the Ethereum network by allowing users to back their own block space and access a premium decentralized RPC. This unique feature opens up various possibilities, enabling users to interact with decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts with enhanced capabilities and efficiency.\n\nETH Liquid Staking Token (LST): Maximizing Benefits\n\nDinero Protocol introduces the ETH Liquid Staking Token (LST) to maximize user benefits. Users can earn staking yields from their ETH holdings by participating in the protocol while utilizing the Dinero protocol's additional utility. The LST acts as a bridge between the staked ETH and the Dinero ecosystem, providing users other benefits and opportunities within the protocol.\n\nThe Significance of Redaction and Curve: \n\nThe partnership between Redacted (the team behind Dinero) and Curve holds significant importance. In the early years of on-chain CDPs, achieving liquidity escape velocity was a primary challenge. The 'bribe power' associated with Redacted, in collaboration with Curve, plays a crucial role in addressing this challenge. Simply put, by utilizing curve protocol, Dinero can achieve critical mass liquidity to operate efficiently. These strategic alliances enhance liquidity and foster the growth and adoption of the Dinero Protocol within the DeFi space.\n\nMore Notable LSTfi CDPs\n\nOrigin Protocol: Origin Protocol is a platform that aims to bring the next 100 million users to crypto through its products in the NFT and DeFi sectors. Its Origin Token (OGN) stakers earn their share of Story's platform fees, and it also offers a yield-generating stablecoin called Origin Dollar (OUSD)\n\nTenet: Tenet is an EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain that utilizes liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) as collateral for network validators, enhancing security and governance inclusivity. It issues tLSDs, representing staked LSDs, and provides yield opportunities from multiple sources, including block rewards, dAPP user incentives, and its native stablecoin, LSDC, minted against overcollateralized positions of tLSDs.\n\nAave GHO: GHO is a stablecoin issued by Aave, and its value is pegged to the US dollar (USD). GHO is fully decentralized and secured by an over-collateralization mechanism, similar to Aave's crypto loans. Aave mints GHO tokens when users of its loan service deposit cryptocurrency as collateral to borrow GHO tokens.\n\nFrax Finance: Frax Finance is a fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol that uses collateralization and algorithmic mechanics processes to create its decentralized stablecoin, FRAX. The collateral ratio, which is the ratio of collateral needed to back $1 of FRAX, varies with time and is solely determined by market forces. Only stablecoins are currently accepted as collateral by the protocol, with plans to accept more volatile collateral like wrapped BTC as the protocol is increasingly adopted\n\nPrisma Finance: Prisma Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that facilitates the utilization of LST as collateral for the purpose of borrowing acUSD, a stablecoin that is fully backed by collateral within the protocol itself. The act of staking acUSD on Curve and Convex platforms is met with rewards in the form of various incentives, including trading fees as well as the governance tokens known as CRV, CVX, and PRISMA.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn short, liquid staking derivatives finance (LSTfi) and collateralized debt positions (CDPs) are revolutionizing decentralized finance (DeFi) by allowing users the ability to leverage their assets, earn interest, and access DeFi services. These protocols provide innovative features such as stablecoin rebalancing, interest-bearing tokens, and unique collateral options. With a growing market and increasing value, LSTfi and CDPs are reshaping the DeFi landscape, creating new user opportunities.\n\nLSTfi and CDPs are transforming DeFi by enabling asset leverage, interest earnings, and access to services. Notable protocols include crvUSD for stablecoin rebalancing, Lybra for interest-bearing stablecoins, Raft for unique leverage and flash mints, Gravita for borrower-friendly terms, and Dinero for user-owned blockspace and premium access. These protocols drive innovation in a rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.\n\nSubscribe\nSources:\n\nStability Pool - Gravita Protocol Docs\n\nCurve Monitor\n\nStablecoins: A Coinbase White Paper\n\nCurve Finance\n\nRaft Docs\n\nLSDFi 💧 (Lybra Finance, Pendle, Unsheth and More!)\n\nGHO Stablecoin - FAQ\n\nCrypto-backed Stablecoins\n\nGravita Protocol Docs\n\n20230406 - v1.0.pdf at master · redacted-cartel/dinero-litepaper · GitHub\n\ncrvUSD Dashboard\n\nMakerBurn\n\nNot financial or tax advice. The purpose of this newsletter is purely educational and should not be considered as investment advice, a request to buy or sell any assets, or a suggestion to make any financial decisions.

    "content": "Discover more from Shoal Research\nCrypto Research and Insights\nOver 1,000 subscribers\nBy subscribing, I agree to Substack's Terms of Use, and acknowledge its Information Collection Notice and Privacy Policy.\nSubscribe\nContinue reading\nSign in\nThe Art and Science of Memecoin Bots, Tooling, and Infrastructure: A Comprehensive Study\nExploring Crypto Bot Services, and a deep dive into bot tooling and Infrastructure\nGABE TRAMBLE\nJUN 13, 2023\n1\nShare\n\nDisclaimer: The concepts and projects discussed in this paper are highly speculative, and the longevity of these initiatives is uncertain. It is important to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before engaging with these projects. \n\nIntro \n\nFrom SaaS (Staking as a Service) to WaaS (Wallet as a Service), a new wave of services is emerging in the crypto space, focusing on BaaS (Bots as a Service) and the explosive memecoin ecosystem. While some complain about the recent “lack” of innovation in the market, and project teams still recovering from the bear market, there are always visionary projects pushing the boundaries. A few savvy teams are now seizing the opportunity presented by the speculative craze surrounding memecoins in the form of memecoin trading infrastructure and tooling.\n\nThanks for reading Shoal Research! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\nSubscribe\n\nThe recent large focus on trading new memecoins could be due to poor market conditions and the possibility of an echo bubble effect within the crypto industry. This echo bubble theory suggests that existing market participants are constantly exchanging funds among themselves, creating a closed loop. Notably, new memecoin projects have experienced exponential growth in market capitalization, some even breaking into the top 100 assets by market cap, generating significant trading volume.\n\nWhile DEX volume may have decreased, the deployment of hundreds of verified smart contracts on Ethereum alone each day is largely driven by the memecoin phenomenon. A good portion of the verified contracts on mainnet (Ethereum) point to new ERC-20s.\n\nAmidst this trading chaos, a select few projects focus on providing essential tools and infrastructure for traders, resembling the role of Levi Strauss (picks, shovels, and jeans) during the gold rush. The recent surge in tooling infrastructure, although still in its early stages, has already significantly impacted traders. These services encompass automated trading solutions that execute trades on behalf of users, leveraging algorithms and data analysis. They also offer real-time monitoring of on-chain smart contracts to identify potential risks like honeypots or rug pulls, safeguarding traders' interests.\n\nEcho Bubble Fuel\n\nMany traders, including prominent venture capital firms, have expressed their dissatisfaction with the current bear market conditions. However, it is essential to note that the crypto market is cyclical in nature, and periods of downturn are not unprecedented. The combination of increased regulatory scrutiny and the overall bearish sentiment in the market may be contributing to the lack of significant project launches in recent months.\n\nDespite the challenging market conditions, total on-chain transaction volume has remained relatively high. It’s worth considering the possibility of an echo bubble phenomenon taking place. \n\nWho cares about memecoin bots?\n\nSimply put, bots are very profitable. While the concept is not groundbreaking, several emerging protocols are propelling the landscape by offering professional-grade trading tools and generating substantial revenue. For example:\n\nMaestro, a prominent telegram bot has raked in an impressive $5.5 million in revenue for the month of May alone, as reported by Defi Llama. \n\nMaestro takes a 1% tax on every successful buy and sell. These fees are automatically collected and sent to the revenue wallet address:\n\n 0xCac0F1A06D3f02397Cfb6D7077321d73b504916e\n\nGenerally, once the revenue wallet collects a certain threshold of fees, they are subsequently sent to a smart contract that distributes the ETH to multiple wallets in one transaction. We can assume much of the revenue is disbursed directly to the core teams and treasury wallets. Maestro has collected 50-100 ETH daily within the last few days.\n\nEtherscan\n\nMaestro empowers traders to exchange tokens through their user-friendly telegram interface seamlessly. It provides many tools to enhance trading efficiency, including contract snipers, copy trading, auto buying, etc. The success of Maestro and similar platforms highlights bots' significant role in facilitating seamless and profitable trading experiences for advanced speculative traders. \n\nAs you might be able to tell, Maestros pro tools allow traders to save time on steps that might cost a difference between getting in a project at 50k MCAP (market capitalization) versus 1m MCAP. With memecoins, speed is a critical piece of the trade.\n\nCompetitive Landscape\n\nMaestro is one of many players in the market offering advanced tooling. There are several other projects in the space working towards similar goals. However, it is essential to note that these projects are still in their early stages and come with a high level of speculation and risk. Market participants must exercise caution.\n\nLets dive into some other service providers that are competing in this “Bot Wars”.\n\nUnibot\n\nUnibot is a platform that aims to provide a solution for rapid memecoin and crypto trading on Telegram. Like Maestro, It allows users to quickly execute buy and sell orders directly from their Telegram hot wallet by pasting a contact pair in the Telegram bot channel.\n\nUnibot optimizes speed by utilizing token pool contracts and supports trading on Uniswap v2 and v3. Additionally, the platform offers advanced features such as Multi-wallet swaps, Smart Method Sniper, and Mirror Sniper, allowing users to enhance their trading strategies. Unbot also employs their UNIBOT token, which gives users a discount on trading fees while also providing revenue share in the near future from staking.\n\nYou can find the comprehensive analysis of Unibot in this earlier report:\n\nShoal Research\nUnibot: The Telegram Uniswap Sniper\nWe’ve all been there Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you want to make a quick crypto trade on info from Telegram, but you don't have the time or ability to navigate the various interfaces and wallets required to do so? Unibot has the answer…\nRead more\n2 years ago · Gabe Tramble\nScarab Tools\n\nScarab Tools, also similar to Unibot and Maestro, is another bot that utilizes an online dashboard that provides trading and analysis tools for newly deployed token contracts. \n\nScarab is a platform specifically designed for trading memecoins, known on scarab as \"dung\", efficiently and transparently. The platform offers timely notifications for new token listings, contract simulation for enhanced transparency, and real-time statistics on token launches.\n\nScarab's roadmap includes the development of a sniper bot for quick swaps and a user-friendly position management dashboard.\n\nPintswap\n\nPintSwap is an OTC (over-the-counter) decentralized exchange (DEX) that introduces a unique approach to trade facilitation in the cryptocurrency market. The platform focuses on low market-cap and low liquidity tokens, aiming to address the issue of high slippage commonly associated with such assets. PintSwap mitigates price impact by conducting OTC transactions and avoids the traditional automated market maker (AMM) pricing mechanics. In contrast to conventional DEXs, PintSwap establishes direct connections between traders using libp2p, a peer-to-peer network stack developed by IPFS.\n\nPintSwaps tooling aims to enhance the efficiency and privacy of over-the-counter (OTC) trading while eliminating significant slippage (price impact). By eliminating the need for visible contracts on the blockchain, PintSwap provides an alternative solution for traders seeking secure and efficient OTC transactions in the crypto space.\n\n0xAuto\n\n0xAuto is a telegram bot designed to simplify the token deployment process on Uniswap V2, PancakeSwap V2, and Goerli's Uniswap V2. Users can deploy a token contract quickly from telegram, eliminating the need for traditional solidity tooling such as Remix to deploy contracts. It offers a range of features, including:\n\nSwift Deployments: Enables quick token deployments\n\nAutomated Liquidity Addition and Etherscan Verification: Integrates with Uniswap V2 and PancakeSwap V2 to add liquidity automatically and simplify Etherscan verification.\n\nSniper Deterrence and Launch Security: Acts as a deterrent against snipers, enhancing the security of token launches.\n\nMulti-Platform Compatibility: Supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Goerli, providing flexibility across different blockchain platforms.\n\nContract Ownership and Customization: Gives contract creators complete ownership and control over token contracts, allowing customization.\n\nthejungool\n\nThejungool is a comprehensive platform that offers advanced features to enhance cryptocurrency trading strategies. With its powerful capabilities, thejungool provides:\n\nAdvanced Coin Filtration: Discover promising coins at launch with early alerts.\n\nToken Sniping: Execute high-speed token purchases with optimized gas and slippage.\n\nPosition Management: Conveniently manage positions through Discord, enabling quick actions.\n\nWatch Pockets: Track influential traders and receive alerts for their buying and selling activities.\n\nTheJungool's automation features enable auto-buying of newly discovered gems, mirroring trades, and real-time social media monitoring of influential figures. Additionally, the tool provides in-depth token analysis, including distribution details and monitoring of whale and sniper wallets. \n\nPepeAnalytics\n\nPepeAnalytics is developing a comprehensive dashboard for analyzing memecoins. Pepe aims to combine social, on-chain, and machine learning to identify new opportunities while providing traders tools to quickly trade based on the platform data. Some notable features include:\n\nSmart Contract Audit Aggregator: Pepe Analytics aggregates existing smart contract audit tools, such as De.Fi and Tokensniffer, to filter out scams and ensure a safe experience when investing at the smart contract level.\n\nDeployer & User Data: The platform recognizes the importance of data related to coin deployment and pair creation. Data includes; funding sources, coin holdings, deployment history, and ownership percentages, as well as data on the investors themselves, top holders, and early participants in the launch.\n\nSocial Analytics: Pepe Analytics acknowledges the significance of reputation and social influence in the memecoin space. Users can copy trade other wallets, with a leaderboard system that notifies users when tracked individuals purchase memecoins. This simple social analytics feature complements the core functionalities of the platform.\n\nBonus: Tokensniper: Pepe Analytics plans to include a token-sniper feature in the dashboard, allowing users to trade tokens based on preset criteria quickly.\n\nblacksmith0x\n\nblacksmith0x is an upcoming platform that aims to automate buying and selling new listings on Uniswap. With their advanced AI model, Blacksmith0x will automatically purchase new Uniswap listings that meet specific conditions and sell them as they appreciate. The platform distinguishes itself by positioning as a developed AI model rather than just a typical Telegram sniper. Despite being an unreleased product, Blacksmith0x has generated curiosity within the crypto community, although limited information has been disclosed about its features and functionalities.\n\nOther interesting Bot Services\n\nFarmerfrens: An automated airdrop farming Telegram bot\n\nSybilSamurai: NFT-gated airdrop farming vaults.\n\nMeowl: A Discord community-centric bot for contract monitoring and sniping.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Crypto market is experiencing a surge in the development of tools and services to enhance trading strategies and capitalize on the booming memecoin trend. These tools offer a range of features and functionalities, including advanced coin filtration, token sniping, position management, influencer tracking, and social analytics. By leveraging these tools, traders can gain an edge in the market, save time, and make more informed investment decisions.\n\nFurthermore, the emergence of echo bubbles highlights the speculative underworld in the current market conditions. However, amidst the chaos, projects are stepping up to provide essential infrastructure and tooling for traders, no matter how Degen (risky). These services aim to enhance efficiency, transparency, and security in the memecoin and general ERC-20 landscape, from smart contract aggregators to comprehensive trading dashboards.\n\nOverall, the rise of these pro-trading tools and the ongoing development of new protocols signifies the dynamic nature of the crypto market. As the market continues to evolve, traders and investors must adapt to these advancements to navigate the ever-changing landscape successfully.\n\nGood luck fellow pioneer  \n\nSources\n\nPepeanalyticsai\n\nhttps://medium.com/@0xAutoBot/introducing-0xswift-bot-the-fastest-token-deployer-for-uniswap-v2-and-beyond-72ec3f169ef\n\nPepe Analytics: Are you ready?\n\nPintswap-docs\n\n0xAuto Docs\n\nMeowl Docs\n\nSybil-samurai docs\n\nState of Crypto Index\n\nNot financial or tax advice. The purpose of this newsletter is purely educational and should not be considered as investment advice, a request to buy or sell any assets, or a suggestion to make any financial decisions.
